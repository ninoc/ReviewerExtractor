During its Dayside Phase, the THEMIS burst-mode is triggered by the encounter of the magnetopause, and full 3-D ion and distributions at 3-s resolution are transmitted to the ground. The high-resolution electron measurements allow the unambiguous determination of the field-line topology throughout the entire magnetopause/boundary layer crossings. In this presentation we will discuss how the boundary layer topology depends on the magnetic shear, and in particular whether the entire dayside magnetopause/boundary layer is on open field lines during high-shear conditions. The information on field-line topology could shed light on the solar wind entry mechanisms., Various nonlinear structures have been observed in the upstream region of Earth’s bow shock. The structures often develop into shock-like structures, which may illustrate the early phase of collisionless shock development. In this study we investigate dynamics of particles associated with the development of the shock-like structures using Cluster multi-spacecraft measurements. Cluster has observed that compressional pulses formed at the upstream edge of density holes grow and steepen into shock-like structures. Examination of phase space distributions of ions shows that at the shock-like structures with amplified magnetic field solar wind ions are just compressed without significant thermalization, which is different from the dynamics of ions observed at Earth's bow shock. Electrons also behave differently from those observed at Earth's bow shock. While the phase space distribution of electrons at Earth's bow shock becomes isotropic, flat-top shape, only a field-aligned component, which moves away from Earth's bow shock, is accelerated, remaining the other part of the distribution unchanged. This results in the generation of large field-aligned current, which could play a significant role in the amplification and dissipation of magnetic field. Wave observations show that broad-band whistler mode waves are enhanced at the shock-like structures, suggesting that the acceleration of electrons results from wave-particle interactions. These observations suggest that electrons play a dominant role in the development of the shock-like structures., We present Cluster multi-point observations at key instances within and above the acceleration region (&gt; 3 Re) of auroral arc current systems. We will primarily focus attention on the temporal development of field-aligned current systems near and within the plasma sheet boundary, associated potentials, and the reorganization of the source and ionospheric plasma that transpire in such systems. We show examples that indicate current system formation/reconfiguration is a process associated with the occurrence of small-scale, field-aligned currents having the properties of Alfven waves. At the plasma sheet boundary layer this may be manifested as the so-called Alfven region. Well-defined, quasistationary upward-downward current sheet paired systems are observed to grow out of such Alfven wave dominated systems of small-scale, field-aligned currents in the span of a few minutes. Characteristic of this evolutionary process is the attenuation of the Alfvenic transients coincident with the growth of the large-scale current system. A preliminary evaluation of one example revealed that the attenuation was associated with the transverse scales approaching the electron inertial scale, indicating the Alfvenic currents became dispersive as the quasistatic arc system developed and thus were susceptible to damping. The data are qualitatively consistent with the predictions of transient response models for magnetospheric-ionospheric coupling. However, our results suggest these models need to be modified to account for dissipation along magnetic field-line for sufficiently small-scale structures., Electromagnetic fluctuations in the inertial range of solar wind MHD turbulence and beyond (up to frequencies of 10Hz) have been studied for the first time using both magnetic field and electric field measurements on Cluster [Bale et al., 2005]. It has been shown that at frequencies above the spectral breakpoint at ~0.4Hz, in the dissipation range, the wave modes become dispersive and are consistent with Kinetic Alfven Waves (KAW). This interpretation, consistent with findings from recent theoretical studies, is based on the simple assumption that the measured frequency spectrum is actually a Doppler shifted wave number spectrum (ω ≈ k Vsw), commonly used in the solar wind and known as Taylor's hypothesis. While Taylor's hypothesis is valid in the inertial range of solar wind turbulence, it may break down in the dissipation range where temporal fluctuations can become important. We recently analyzed the effect of Doppler shift on KAW as well as compressional proton whistler waves [Salem et al., 2009]. The dispersive properties of the KAW and the whistler wave modes, as well as the electric to magnetic field (E/B) ratio, have been determined both analytically and numerically in the plasma and the spacecraft frame, with the goal of directly comparing those analytical/numerical estimates in the spacecraft frame with the data as measured. We revisit here Cluster electric field and magnetic field data in the solar wind using this approach. We focus our analysis on several ambient solar wind intervals with varying plasma parameters, allowing for a statistical study. We show that this technique provides an efficient diagnostics for wave-mode identification in the dissipation/dispersion range of solar wind turbulence., We present the time history and evolution of the 3-dimensional size, shape, and orientation of the slow, classic streamer blowout CME of 2008 Jun 01 by combining STEREO-A remote imaging of its interplanetary propagation with in situ STEREO-B plasma and field measurements at 1~AU. The STEREO-A HI coverage allows unambigious identification of the CME white light front-cavity structure and the resulting ICME flux rope boundaries in running difference images. The elongation-time tracks predict the arrival of the ICME at STEREO-B on 2008 June 06 remarkably well. Starting from the simplest in situ flux rope model for the coherent magnetic cloud field structure, we utilize the unprecedented coverage of the coronal and heliospheric imaging observations to obtain important corrections for the ICME flux rope geometry. MHD modeling results obtained from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center for the ambient heliopsheric solar wind stream structure and a simple CME-like density-pulse propagation are used to verify the overall propagation direction and characterize some of the observed evolutionary properties. The ICME radial expansion, i.e. the time evolution of the flux rope radius Rc(t) from the STEREO-A elongation-time plots, is well approximated by the standard treatment of constant radial expansion Vexp = 24.5 km/s measured from the in situ bulk velocity profile. The 3-dimensional spatial orientation of the ICME flux rope determined by forward modeling in the inner heliosphere shows excellent agreement with the observed 1~AU flux rope orientation and evidence for large scale rotation of the ICME flux rope during its propagation, as predicted by recent numerical simulations. In addition, measurements of the CME's latitudinal angular width allows us to improve the estimate the actual flux rope cross-sectional area and measurements of the CME's longitudinal extent allows us to estimate a more realistic CME ``loop length"". These geometric quantities are used to improve the estimates of the ICME in situ toroidal and poloidal magnetic fluxes, ΦT and ΦP. The in situ flux values are then compared to the magnetic fluxes inferred from this event's source region, which includes a substantial portion of the large scale coronal helmet streamer belt. We conlude by discussing our results in the context of both CME initiation and the physical mechanism(s) that energize the pre-eruption configuration. Support for this work was provided by NASA HGI NNX08AJ04G., We use observations from the solar aspect sensor of RHESSI to characterize the latitude dependence of the temperature of the photosphere at the solar limb. Previous observations have suggested the presence of a polar temperature excess as large as 1.5 K. The RHESSI observations, made with a rotating telescope in space, have great advantages in the rejection of systematic errors in the very precise photometry required for such an observation. This photometry is differential, i.e. relative to a mean limb-darkening function. The data base consists of about 1,000 images per day from linear CCDs with 1.73 arc sec square pixels, observing a narrow band (12nm FWHM) at 670 nm. Each image shows a chord crossing the disk at a different location as the spacecraft rotates and precesses around its average solar pointing. We fit an average limb-darkening function and reassemble the residuals into synoptic maps of differential intensity variations as function of position angle. We further mask these images against SOHO/EIT 284A images in order to eliminate magnetic regions. The analysis establishes a limit on the quadrupole dependence of temperature (brightness) on position angle of 0.04 +/- 0.02 K. This results in a possible correction of our precise measurement of the solar oblateness which is smaller than its rms error of 0.14 mas., CME propagation through the heliosphere has been one of the most uncertain problems, due to its complex nature and sparse observations in the vast space. CME travel time, speed and trajectory have been often unpredictable, because they may be modified going through ambient solar wind streams and IMF structure. All of these parameters are important for understanding CMEs and their space weather consequences. Direct observations of CME propagation through to 1AU have only become a reality since the recent STEREO Heliospheric Imager (HI) observations. Based on a few strategically selected CMEs that vary in parameter space and situated in different solar wind/IMF conditions, we perform several CCMC ENLIL with cone model simulations to study the propagation. Comparisons between modeling results including CME driven shock properties, travel time, 3D trajectory, and distortion of the ejecta (limited to the model approximation) will be made. Comparisons are also made between modeling, HI imaging results, and observed in-situ parameters when available., The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search experiment (CDMS) is using Phonon+Ionization detectors to search for Dark Matter in the form of Weakly Interactive Massive Particles (WIMPs). We report on new results from the operation of CDMS five ``towers'' at Soudan underground laboratory. With new and more massive detectors, SuperCDMS project has been started since March 2009. We report on the current status of SuperCDMS and its perspective., We present results from the Fly's Eye Transient Search, a 500-hour wide-field survey for powerful millisecond time-scale dispersed radio transients using the Allen Telescope Array (ATA). In this effort, we pointed each of the extant 42 ATA dishes at a unique position on the sky to attain a maximal field-of-view of approximately 198 square degrees (at L-band). The Fly's Eye field programmable gate array-based fast readout spectrometer processes 44 independent signal paths, each with a bandwidth of 209 MHz, and produces 128-channel spectra, accumulated for 0.6ms., Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of magnetic reconnection are performed to study multi-island coalescence and associated particle acceleration. Although it has been pointed out that multi-island coalescence leads to efficient particle acceleration, detailed analysis of energy spectrum and particle behaviors had not been carried out. Here, we start by comparing two different runs. The first run produces a dominant X-line at which particles are continuously accelerated by the reconnection electric field. The second run produces multiple magnetic islands that eventually merge each other. Particles are accelerated in a bursty manner during each coalescence phase. We have found that the second run produces more energetic particles (both ions and electrons) compared to the first run. We will discuss the details of the efficiency and the mechanism of particle acceleration., Flow and magnetic field in the outer core are distributed over a vast range of length scale from the size of the outer core to the thickness of the boundary layers. Numerical simulations cannot include the full range of scales, so sub-grid scale (SGS) models are required to account for the effects of the unresolved fields on the large scale fields in geodynamo simulations. We performed a large-eddy simulation (LES) of a dynamo in a rotating spherical shell and a rotating plane layer model using the dynamic scale-similarity SGS model. We use the same SGS model for both simulations, but we find some important differences in the behaviors of the SGS terms between these simulations. In the present study, we compare the characteristics of the SGS terms in these geometries. The SGS model employed in the simulations is a dynamic scale-similarity model. We include terms for the SGS momentum and heat flux, the SGS Lorentz force, and the SGS magnetic induction. We also correct the commutation error caused by interchanging the order of the spatial differentiations and filtering operation. The amplitudes of the SGS term and commutation error correction are adjusted automatically with a dynamic scheme, based on the Germano identity. Spatial averaging is required in the dynamic scheme to obtain reliable model coefficients. We average over longitude in the spherical shell model and over horizontal surfaces in the plane layer model. In the simulation results, the energy flux in the magnetic induction term exhibits the largest difference between the simulations in the two domains. In the rotating plane layer model, energy flux of the SGS induction term is negative at all vertical positions z. The energy flux of the SGS induction term in the spherical shell model is also negative near the inner boundary but becomes positive near the outer boundary., The auroral spiral, occurring in some auroral arcs, is a prominent vortex structure in the optical data. Although ample ground-based observational descriptions of auroral spirals exist, their magnetospheric counterparts are far less investigated. Thus, many questions remain regarding the generation mechanism of auroral spirals. Here we present simultaneous observations of auroral spirals and their regions of generation in the near-Earth plasma sheet using THEMIS’s spacecraft and its ground network of all-sky imagers and magnetometers., We study 15 prompt 3He-rich electron events observed near 1 AU by Wind/3DP above 50 keV. The events are associated with magnetically well-connected flares (between W10 and W85) with rather short soft X-ray duration (~10 min) and HXR sources seen by RHESSI on the visible solar disk. We compare the Wind/3DP observations with the results of interplanetary transport simulations, to infer the properties of the propagation and constrain the injection of solar energetic electrons in the interplanetary medium. We discuss the correlation between the inferred total number of injected electrons with the number of electrons required to produce the observed X-ray flux., When they cross the terrestrial magnetosheath (MS), the 4 Cluster spacecraft regularly observe magnetospheric (Msph) plasma incursions surrounded by a boundary layer (BL). This kind of region is known to be composed of an inner and an outer regions. Contrary to previous studies which distinguished these latter from the presence/absence of Msph particles, we show here that both of these regions contain not only an accelerated and/or heated MS plasma but also a diffusive high energy Msph population whose pitch angle distribution depends on the region of the BL crossed. Moreover, in the case presented here, a third population characterized by a lower energy, coming from the ionosphere, was also detected but on the inside edge of the Msph boundary. Its particular structure as a function of pitch angle suggests a heating mechanism different from the one existing in the boundary layer yet located nearby. From the electron, E and B fields and wave data, we show how the plasma is structured within the magnetospheric domain and demonstrate that the heating region of the ionospheric electrons is located in the close vicinity of the mirror point of the high energy Msph electrons., Observations of both the Sun and other magnetically active stars have shown that non-flare soft-X-ray (SXR) luminosity is related to the total unsigned photospheric magnetic flux by a power law, with exponent ~1.2 (Pevtsov 2003). The relationship between magnetic flux and *flaring* soft-X-rays (SXR) and hard-X-ray (HXR) luminosities, however, has not been characterized. We will investigate the relationship between properties of SXR and HXR flare emission and photospheric magnetic fields for the solar case, using flare observations from the RHESSI and GOES satellites, combined with active region (AR) magnetograms from SOHO/MDI., Fractures that penetrate more than halfway through a floating ice shell can encounter ambient temperatures at least 100K warmer than the surface. If all of the radiation emitted along the walls of a 10km-deep fracture escapes from the subsurface, the total emission could be as high as 106 W per map-view meter of crack. We present a model that allows cracks to transfer heat vertically through thermal emission of radiation from the crack walls and Lambertian scattering through the crack. We present the predicted temperature profiles at the surface in the neighborhood of the fracture and also the emission that an observer would see emanating from the fracture itself. We use results from Rudolph and Manga, Icarus 2009 to inform our choice of fracture geometry and depth. Preliminary calculations predict that a 1-m wide by 4 km-deep fracture on Enceladus could radiate about 300 W/m averaged over its first several years of opening. Although this effect may not be capable of explaining the exceptionally high heat flow from the south pole of Enceladus, it may be used to constrain the depth and geometry of young tensile fractures on an icy moon., A large fraction (tens of percent) of the energy released in solar flares goes into accelerated ions and electrons, and studies indicate that these two populations have comparable energy content. RHESSI observations have shown a striking close linear correlation between the 2.223 MeV neutron-capture gamma-ray line and electron bremsstrahlung emission &gt;300 keV, indicating that the flare acceleration of &gt;~20 MeV protons and &gt;300 keV electrons is roughly proportional over &gt;3 orders of magnitude in fluence. We investigate how this correlation between ion and electron acceleration weakens when comparing against electrons above various lower-energy thresholds, with a number of flares that appear to have a significant relative excess of low-energy bremsstrahlung emission compared to other flares. We take a close look at these particular flares and discuss possible explanations for the observed behavior., Core convection is driven by a combination of thermal and chemical buoyancy. Both sources of buoyancy are likely to be weaker at the top of the core than at the bottom, the former because the adiabatic gradient is steeper at the top and conducts more heat away, the latter because it is unlikely that light elements pass through the CMB to any large degree, making zero flux the appropriate boundary condition there. This raises the possibility of stable stratification at the top of the core. Furthermore, light elements may still be dissolving into the core from the mantle, forming a thin stratified upper layer. Reverse flux patches on the core-mantle boundary arise from expulsion of toroidal magnetic field: no other mechanism seems big enough to explain their formation in the Southern Hemisphere during the last 200 years. This requires upwelling within the top 70 km or so of the core, giving evidence against a stably stratified layer. Furthermore, absence of flux inside the tangent cylinder requires upwelling in a region where convection is hard to drive. On the other hand, thermal core-mantle boundary interaction is inhibited by strong convection in the uppermost core: thermal anomalies in the mantle can only influence deep core convection by thermal conduction through the upper layers of the liquid core. These effects are demonstrated using numerical geodynamo simulations with varying stratification at the top. Extrapolation to Earth-like parameters suggests that we would be very unlikely to observe any thermal core-mantle interaction with convection occurring all the way to the core-mantle boundary. The conflict between these observations, of reverse flux formation, low polar flux, and thermal core-mantle interaction, can be resolved with a thin stratified layer 50-100 km thick at the top of the core., This study investigates the temporal variability of longitudinal structure in F2 layer peak height (h<SUB>mF_2</SUB>) in the equatorial ionosphere. For this study, electron density profiles retrieved from the radio occultation measurements by the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) are fitted with a two-layer Chapman function to determine h<SUB>mF_2</SUB>. A spectral analysis is performed on the time series of h<SUB>mF_2</SUB> in the magnetic equatorial region, and the analysis finds a strong four-peaked longitudinal structure that has been identified in other ionospheric observations. The four-peaked structure is likely the signature of the forcing by the eastward propagating non-migrating diurnal tide with zonal wavenumber-3 (DE3). Further analysis for the period of prominent four-peaked structure over August/September 2008 finds that this structure exhibits a 5-day and a 2-day periodicity. Coincidentally the SKiYMET meteor radar wind measurements at Thumba (8.5<SUP>o</SUP>N, 77<SUP>o</SUP>E) indicate periods of strong 5-day and 2-day planetary waves in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Here, the study is to investigate the correspondence of these planetary waves with the temporal modulation of h<SUB>mF_2</SUB>., Since its surprising discovery in the Apollo era, lunar magnetism has proven enigmatic and difficult to interpret. A crucial piece of information needed to determine the origins of lunar remanent crustal magnetization is its strength and relationship to surface and subsurface geology. However, we cannot easily determine the distribution of surface crustal magnetic field strength, let alone make the connection from magnetic field to subsurface magnetization. Surface magnetometer measurements provide ground truth, but only exist for a few sites. Spacecraft magnetometers have mapped much of the lunar field distribution, but the observation altitude (tens of km) limits the resolvable wavelength - potentially problematic since surface measurements indicate significant or even dominant small-wavelength components. Electron reflectometry (ER) measurements, meanwhile, provide a remote measurement of the surface field strength, but ER sensitivity to crustal fields is also potentially limited by the electron gyroradius (~10 km). The response of a magnetometer to distributions of magnetization with different spatial wavelengths is well understood and easily modeled; however, the analogous response of the electron reflectometry technique has not yet been considered in detail. Therefore, we have simulated the trajectories of millions of electrons through magnetic fields produced by synthetic crustal magnetization distributions, in order to determine the sensitivity of the ER technique to distributions of magnetization with different strengths and spatial wavelengths. We report on the results of these simulations, and consider the implications for lunar magnetism and its origins., The “etched terrain” on Mars is reported to consist of mesas, pits, ridges, etc. formed by differential erosion of layered sedimentary deposits (Griffes et al. 2007). Here we present our work on a unique landscape in northern Chile that possesses many of the features of etched terrain on Mars, offering an Earth-based perspective on the eolian and aqueous processes involved in the formation of these landscapes. The Quillagua-Llamar Basin is largely infilled by Miocene to Pliocene aged lacustrine and salt deposits, and likely represented the terminal, and highly saline, facies of an internally drained river system that originated in the Andes (Sáez et al., 1999). This deposition continues more slowly today, with water, sediment and salts delivered to portions of the basin by streams originating to the east. The surficial deposits in the present Salar Llamara consist of a complex of Tertiary to Holocene alluvial fans and nearly pure Tertiary Ca-sulfate and halite outcrops. Ancient sulfate deposits exhibit complex topography with large (eolian?) depressions and modest soil weathering in the largely hyperarid climate. Fluvial deposits have experienced apparent deflation (relative to the coeval sulfate deposits) of several m, have a pronounced stepped topography caused by differential deflation of soil horizons of sulfate, and exhibit an accumulation of dark fluvial gravels and sand in the deflation zones. Most halite outcrops, in contrast, are highly impacted by frequent fog and quickly develop (~ 103 y) a cobbly or “nut like” surface of halite fragments that undergo repeated hydration and dehydration. The halite cobbles are habitats for abundant photosynthesizing organisms. Isolated saline lakes contain unusual stromatolitic structures. Additionally, halite deposits contain occasional sink holes and caves caused by long term aqueous dissolution of the soluble matrix. Satellite imagery, field observations, and geochemical analyses of the surficial deposits will be presented to provide insights into the origin of this unique landscape and its relationship to Mars. Griffes, J.L. et al. 2007. J.G.R. 112 doi:10.1029/2006JE002811 Sáez, A. et al. 1999. Palaeo., Palaeo., Palaeo. 151:5-37., The heat provided by energetic impacts, radioactive decay and core formation during the early stages in terrestrial planet evolution is sufficient to melt a silicate mantle partially or entirely. Thus, magma-ocean models provide an interesting hypothetical starting point for understanding mantle evolution of terrestrial planets. A key constraint in these models is the formation of an early atmosphere, because it exerts a strong control over the heat flux from the planetary surface. One open question in the task of developing a model of early atmosphere formation is related to when volatiles begin to exsolve from the magma ocean and in what quantities. Even magma oceans with initial minute water or carbon contents will eventually, as they solidify, become saturated and begin to exsolve volatiles as gases. The bubble size distribution in the magma is likely to exert a strong control over this process: small gas bubbles will tend to remain entrained in vigorous convection while large bubbles decouple from the surrounding flow field and rise to the surface under their own buoyancy. In this paper, we use numerical simulations of two-phase flow to investigate how the size distribution of gas bubbles in a magma ocean depends on its physical characteristics, such as composition, magma viscosity and volatile content. The numerical technique couples a level-set-based representation of the interface to a Navier-Stokes solver through the construction of extension velocities. Preliminary results indicate that gas bubbles in superliquidus magma oceans with low viscosity remain small. In fact, current estimates of the radius at which gas bubbles cease to be entrained in flow and begin to rise to the free surface under their buoyancy might exceed the radius of stable gas bubbles. This observation implies that the earliest atmospheres might form only during the final stages of magma-ocean solidification and possibly through very rapid degassing of oversaturated magma. Late, rapid degassing from a putative terrestrial magma ocean, for example following a Moon-forming impact, implies that solidification of magma oceans would have been exceptionally fast. Rapid interior cooling in turn makes the time to clement surface conditions rapid, preparing the planetary surface for liquid water., Previous statistical observations have shown that the recovery time scales of substorms occurring in the winter and near equinox (when the nighttime auroral zone was in darkness) are roughly twice as long as the recovery time scales for substorms occurring in the summer (when the nighttime auroral region was sunlit). This suggests that auroral substorms in the northern and southern hemispheres develop asymmetrically during solstice conditions with substorms lasting longer in the winter (dark) hemisphere than in the summer (sunlit) hemisphere. Additionally, this implies that more energy is deposited by electron precipitation in the winter hemisphere than in the summer one during substorms. This result, coupled with previous observations that have shown that auroral activity is more common when the ionosphere is in darkness and is suppressed when the ionosphere is in daylight, strongly suggests that the ionospheric conductivity plays an important role governing how magnetospheric energy is transferred to the ionosphere during substorms. Therefore, the ionosphere itself may dictate how much energy it will accept from the magnetosphere during substorms rather than this being an externally imposed quantity. Here, we extend our earlier work by statistically analyzing the recovery time scales for a large number of substorms observed in the conjugate hemispheres simultaneously by two orbiting global auroral imagers: Polar UVI and IMAGE FUV. Our current results are consistent with previous observations. The recovery time scales are observed to be longer in the winter (dark) hemisphere while the auroral activity has a shorter duration in the summer (sunlit) hemisphere. This leads to an asymmetric energy input from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere with more energy being deposited in the winter hemisphere than in the summer hemisphere., Our Sun is a vibrating and amazing celestial object, full of little-understood phenomena. One such phenomenon is the so-called Sunquake, originally observed by Kosovichev and Zharkova (1998). Studies by Donea and Lindsey (2005) and Besliu et al. (2008) now show that the sunquake is not a rare phenomenon. They are powerful events, hardly visible on the solar surface, and result directly from energy release. They can be detected using acoustic techniques as high frequencies oscillations in the sun. The first models proposed to explain sunquakes involved pressure pulses, perhaps associated with heating revealed by white-light flare emission. Hudson, Fisher and Welsh (2008) proposed a mechanism to generate seismic waves based on the dynamical behavior of the solar magnetic field during flares. In this poster we study the variations of the magnetic field as an alternative mechanism for the generation of seismic waves., The hunt for Earth-like worlds has taken a major step forward with the discovery of a planet only 2.7 times larger than Earth. Its mass and size are just as theorists would expect for a water-rich super-Earth., Most black hole binaries show large changes in X-ray luminosity caused primarily by variations in mass accretion rate. An important question for understanding black hole accretion and jet production is whether the inner edge of the accretion disk recedes at low accretion rate. Measurements of the location of the inner edge (R <SUB>in</SUB>) can be made using iron emission lines that arise due to fluorescence of iron in the disk, and these indicate that R <SUB>in</SUB> is very close to the black hole at high and moderate luminosities (gsim1% of the Eddington luminosity, L <SUB>Edd</SUB>). Here, we report on X-ray observations of the black hole GX 339 - 4 in the hard state by Suzaku and the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer that extend iron line studies to 0.14% L <SUB>Edd</SUB> and show that R <SUB>in</SUB> increases by a factor of &gt;27 over the value found when GX 339 - 4 was bright. The exact value of R <SUB>in</SUB> depends on the inclination of the inner disk (i), and we derive 90% confidence limits of R <SUB>in</SUB> &gt; 35R<SUB>g</SUB> at i = 0° and R <SUB>in</SUB> &gt; 175R<SUB>g</SUB> at i = 30°. This provides direct evidence that the inner portion of the disk is not present at low luminosity, allowing for the possibility that the inner disk is replaced by advection- or magnetically dominated accretion flows., We investigate a f(R) modification of gravity that is exponential in the Ricci scalar R to explain cosmic acceleration. The steepness of this dependence provides extra freedom to satisfy solar system and other curvature regime constraints. With a parameter to alleviate the usual fine-tuning of having the modification strengthen near the present, the total number of parameters is only one more than ΛCDM. The resulting class of solutions asymptotes to w=-1 but has no cosmological constant. We calculate the dynamics in detail, examine the effect on the matter power spectrum, and provide a simple fitting form relating the two., We demonstrate that the intracluster medium (ICM) of clusters of galaxies is everywhere convectively unstable to one of two instabilities driven by anisotropic thermal conduction along magnetic field lines, despite having stably stratified entropy gradients. Outside any cooling core, the magnetothermal instability (MTI) reorients magnetic fields to be largely radial, enhancing the effective radial thermal conductivity. In galaxy clusters with a cooling core, the heat-flux-driven buoyancy instability (HBI) has the opposite effect. By reducing the effective radialB thermal conductivity, the HBI can hasten the onset of a cooling catastrophe for low central entropy clusters., A common feature observed in 40Ar/39Ar age spectra of extraterrestrial (ET) rocks is a conspicuous decrease in the ages of high temperature extractions relative to lower temperature steps and a correlated increase in Ca/K, often succeeded by a monotonic increase in ages. This feature is routinely attributed to recoil-implanted 39Ar from a potassium (K)-rich donor phase into a K-poor receptor phase (e.g., 1,2). While 39Ar recoil redistribution is undoubtedly manifested in many terrestrial and ET 40Ar/39Ar whole-rock age spectra, it cannot easily explain the magnitude of high release temperature 40Ar*/39ArK anomalies observed in Martian meteorites ALH 84001 and Nakhla, as well as other course-grained meteorites and lunar rocks. Depending on the aliquot and sample, 50 - 100% of the pyroxene release spectra in ALH 84001 and Nakhla appear strongly perturbed to lower ages. As the mean recoil distance of 39Ar ~0.1 µm, the recoil hypothesis demands that a high-K phase be ubiquitously distributed amongst sub-micron to micron sized pyroxene crystals to account for the observed pyroxene age spectra. However, in both Nakhla and ALH 84001, pyroxene is often completely isolated from high-K phases and individual grains commonly exceed 100 µm in diameter. 40Ar/39Ar analyses of pyroxene-bearing terrestrial basalts, wherein fine-grained pyroxene and plagioclase are intimately adjoined, show that recoil-implanted 39Ar into pyroxene produces much less precipitous anomalies in 40Ar*/39ArK, as predicted by the recoil lengthscale. An alternative hypothesis is that whole-rock age spectra of ET samples with anomalously low ages at high temperatures may reflect diffusive 40Ar distributions within considerably degassed pyroxene grains. Owing to apparent differences in activation energies between glass and/or plagioclase and pyroxene, 40Ar may diffuse more rapidly from pyroxene under certain high-temperature conditions (i.e., above the temperature at which the extrapolated Ar Arrhenius relationships intersect). Thus, very brief, high-temperature shock-heating events may preferentially degas pyroxene without significantly resetting glass and plagioclase 40Ar/39Ar age spectra. This effect would be enhanced by highly localized shock-heating focused along pyroxene (sub)grain boundaries, as has been inferred in other cases (e.g., 3). The shock and impact origin of this feature may explain its frequent appearance in ET samples, regardless of grain size, as well as the general absence of terrestrial analogs. We will present new 40Ar/39Ar data from Martian meteorites and physical models to distinguish between these competing hypotheses. References Cited: 1.

EPSL 209, 323-336., Solar jets, or transient, collimated brightenings, were first observed in soft x-rays by Yohkoh in the 1990’s. These observations led to the establishment of the Shibata-Heyvaerts emerging flux model for reconnection associated with jets. This model also predicts hard x-ray (HXR) emission during jet production, and recent RHESSI and HINODE observations appear to support this prediction. Unfortunately, projection effects make it difficult to determine whether HXR sources on the solar disk correspond to flare footpoints or the jet itself. Observation of jets near or at the solar limb can lessen this type of source confusion. Here, we present RHESSI observations of a partially occulted HXR flare that coincides with an EUV jet observed by TRACE on August 21, 2003. A double coronal HXR source is observed shortly before the emission of the jet, indicating the location of reconnection outflows. Thick- and thin-target models are used to estimate the electron energies and densities in the HXR sources, and allow for comparison with the emerging flux model., The Monterey Ocean Bottom Broadband (MOBB) observatory has been acquiring broadband seismic data and auxiliary channels (differential pressure and current meter) since its installation on the ocean floor in Monterey Bay, at 1000 m water depth and 40 km off-shore. Operating autonomously for almost 7 years, the system was successfully connected to the MARS cable (www.mbari.org/mars) on February 26th, 2009, via a 3.6 km extension cable from the MARS science node. The system works as designed and is currently streaming data from seismic, pressure, and water-current sensors to the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory, where it joins data from other broadband stations on land and is archived at the Northern California Earthquake Data Center. The availability of real-time MOBB broadband seismic data provides an opportunity for improving earthquake-monitoring capability in central California, particularly near the Santa Cruz Mountains segment of the San Andreas fault, and the San Gregorio fault. While buried in the mud, MOBB is affected by oceanic sources of noise, which are particularly strong in the infragravity wave band, and care must be taken to reduce this background noise in post-processing. We present examples of data analysis and illustrate how MOBB contributes to the determination of source parameters and regional structure., Cassini observations have found that the plasma and magnetic field conditions upstream of Titan are far more complex than they were thought to be after the Voyager encounter. Understanding the effects of the variable upstream conditions on Titan's plasma interaction and the evolution of Titan's ionosphere/atmosphere is one of the main objectives of the Cassini mission. To compliment the mission we perform hybrid simulations of Titan's plasma interaction to examine the effects of the incident plasma and magnetic field have on Titan's ionosphere. We closely examine the results on Titan's induced magnetosphere and the resulting pickup ion properties., Multiple lines of evidence, including geomorphologic features and isotope measurements of the current atmosphere, indicate that at one point Mars sustained a robust atmosphere capable of supporting significant quantities of liquid water. However, the Martian atmosphere is now greatly depleted, implying that atmosphere has been lost to space and the subsurface over time. In addition to other modes of atmospheric loss, bulk escape - the large-scale removal of coherent portions of ionospheric plasma from the upper atmosphere - has likely contributed to depletion. Recent observations of a large Martian flux rope in the process of carrying ionospheric plasma away from Mars indicate that flux ropes could be an important means of bulk escape. Previously, a statistical study of magnetic field data recorded during the elliptical aerobreaking phase of the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Mission revealed many relatively small ionospheric flux ropes at a variety of altitudes (Vignes et at., 2003). However, more than seven years of circular mapping data from MGS have not yet been analyzed for the presence of flux ropes, large or small, and hold the potential to inform our understanding of rope characteristics and dynamics. By examining MGS magnetic field data and employing minimum variance analysis of selected time intervals, we identify flux ropes in the MGS mapping data and create a database of their properties. From this database we compute the average values and standard deviations for each of many rope features, which effectively acts as a statistical rope model. Further, relations between rope characteristics (i.e. formation frequency, dimensions, plasma capacity, etc.) and external conditions (i.e. solar zenith angle, altitude, local crustal magnetization, solar wind pressure, etc.) are developed. These data constrain rope formation and termination conditions and mechanisms, modify estimates for particle loss via ropes, and further characterize rope dynamics, thus helping us to evaluate the importance of Martian flux ropes for atmospheric escape., The gravitational field of planetary bodies is commonly partitioned into hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic contributions (non-hydrostatic theory). However, this partitioning is not appropriate for planets like Mars with long-term elastic strength. Although Bills and James (1999) noted that the present Martian rotation pole would be unstable if the non-hydrostatic theory is adopted, previous studies used this theory to constrain true polar wander on Mars. We illustrate that the inferred paleopole position in these studies implies that the present rotation pole is unstable. Daradich et al. (2008) showed that the current rotation pole is stable, as expected, with a new theory that incorporates a partitioning into equilibrium and non-equilibrium contributions (non-equilibrium theory). They constrained the true polar wander on Mars driven by the formation of Tharsis using the non-equilibrium theory. We extend their analysis in several ways. First, Daradich et al. (2008) used the present location of Tharsis’ center location estimated in previous studies that adopt the non-hydrostatic theory. We estimate it using a semi-analytic procedure that is self-consistent with the non-equilibrium theory. This procedure can be used to remove Tharsis’ contribution from the observed gravity field. Second, Daradich et al. (2008) use the C20 and C22 gravity coefficients, and we extend their analysis to include the C21, S21, and S22 coefficients as additional constraints. Third, we take into account the effect of other surface loads with known locations (Elysium, Utopia, and Hellas). Finally, we quantify the size of the excess contributions required to explain the observed gravity field., Elementary educators typically have only limited opportunity to teach extensive science units. This is due in great part to the primary focus on literacy and mathematics instruction in the early grades. It is not surprising then, that the time and resources allocated to science teaching are significantly less than those allocated to language arts and mathematics. The integration of elementary science curriculum with language arts provides one means of addressing the challenge of keeping science education robust in the elementary classroom. For this important audience—young learners—we have developed three successful K-4 NASA curricula, Eye on the Sky, Reading, Writing and Rings! and The Solar System Through the Eyes of Scientists. Together they suggest a model for successful age-appropriate science instruction. All have been developed by NASA scientists and UC Berkeley educators in partnership with classroom teachers. Eye on the Sky focuses on Heliospheric science for young students, making the Sun-Earth connection accessible in the primary grades; Reading Writing and Rings! contains a suite of lessons exploring Saturn, Titan and NASA’s Cassini Mission and The Solar System Through the Eyes of Scientists provides an introduction to the eight planets, and the moons of the solar system. The activities have been assessed by independent educational evaluators and have been tested in classrooms and used extensively by teachers. We will highlight best practices for developing materials for the early grades and strategies for integrating science across the curriculum—in particular the integration of science with math, language arts and art. Examples of student work will be included. The benefits and challenges inherent in implementing an EP/O program in the elementary school setting will also be addressed., Understanding the effect of extreme solar wind conditions on atmospheric escape at Venus is crucial to understanding the evolution of the planet, and other unmagnetized bodies in the solar system such as Mars. Because Venus lacks a global dynamo magnetic field, the solar wind interacts directly with its ionosphere, leading to the loss of atmospheric constituents (particularly oxygen) by processes such as ion pick-up. This study uses data from the Venus Express (VEX) ASPERA-4 Ion Mass Analyzer (IMA)instrument for measurement of escaping oxygen and the VEX magnetometer to give the solar wind context. Previous analyses of VEX IMA data have shown populations of planetary ions at low energies (~10’s of eV) and distinctly beam shaped classical pick-up ion features (“beams”) at higher energies (&gt;1 keV). This study focuses on the high energy pick-up ion features. A survey of 389 VEX orbits during 2006 and 2007 reveals 265 samples of these features in 197 separate orbits. Corresponding magnetometer data during the same period shows that 17 ICMEs (Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections) impacted Venus, engulfing it in the characteristic strong, rotating interplanetary magnetic fields and enhanced solar wind of these disturbances. The high energy pick-up ions organize according to the solar wind conditions in that they accelerate to higher energies at low altitudes during ICMEs relative to periods of quiet solar wind. There is not a clear dependence of the escaping oxygen flux on ICMEs. This may be because these events occurred during solar minimum when ICMEs typically do not have high velocity., The Cassini spacecraft's discovery of active plumes at the south pole of Enceladus on its July 2006 flyby has sparked greater interest in both its internal and external physical and chemical properties. We choose to investigate the macroscopic surface texture of this active south polar region by implementing a surface roughness model developed by Buratti and Veverka (1985). The model requires intensity scans of Enceladus's surface and two unknown parameters: a scattering parameter A that indicates whether single or diffuse scattering is occurring, and a surface phase function f (α) that reflects changes in intensity due to various factors such as the single scattering albedo and the single particle phase function. The output is a quantitative description of surface roughness through a depth-to-radius ratio q. After fitting the model to the data, we find that plains north of the “tiger stripes” are fairly smooth, with preliminary values for q of around 0.08. Meanwhile, the stripes themselves are only slightly more rough, with preliminary values for q of around 0.10. These results strongly suggest in-filled coating of craters with water-ice throughout the entire south polar region of Enceladus. Furthermore, the model surface roughness of Enceladus does not appear to be sensitive to the choice of our photometric function, as changing A has little effect on q., Although refraction of light at grain boundaries can significantly alter Brillouin spectra-hence inferred acoustic velocities-of powder samples, we demonstrate that the effects of (multiple) elastic scattering can be eliminated through 1) use of refractive index-matching oils or 2) application of high pressures (≥1 GPa). In this manner, we determine the acoustic-wave velocities of soda-lime glass powder to pressures of 13 GPa, finding good agreement with previous measurements on bulk samples. Our results provide a baseline for reliable acoustic-wave velocity measurements at high pressures via Brillouin spectroscopy on polycrystalline samples., A star that wanders too close to a massive black hole (BH) is shredded by the BH's tidal gravity. Stellar gas falls back to the BH at a rate initially exceeding the Eddington rate, releasing a flare of energy. In anticipation of upcoming transient surveys, we predict the light curves and spectra of tidal flares as a function of time, highlighting the unique signatures of tidal flares at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. A reasonable fraction of the gas initially bound to the BH is likely blown away when the fallback rate is super-Eddington at early times. This outflow produces an optical luminosity comparable to that of a supernova; such events have durations of ~10 d and may have been missed in supernova searches that exclude the nuclear regions of galaxies. When the fallback rate subsides below Eddington, the gas accretes onto the BH via a thin disc whose emission peaks in the ultraviolet to soft X-rays. Some of this emission is reprocessed by the unbound stellar debris, producing a spectrum of very broad emission lines (with no corresponding narrow forbidden lines). These lines are the strongest for BHs with M<SUB>BH</SUB> ~ 10<SUP>5</SUP>-10<SUP>6</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB> and thus optical surveys are particularly sensitive to the lowest mass BHs in galactic nuclei. Calibrating our models to ROSAT and Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) observations, we predict detection rates for Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS), the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and highlight some of the observational challenges associated with studying tidal disruption events in the optical. Upcoming surveys such as Pan-STARRS should detect at least several events per year, and may detect many more if current models of outflows during super-Eddington accretion are reasonably accurate. These surveys will significantly improve our knowledge of stellar dynamics in galactic nuclei, the physics of super-Eddington accretion, the demography of intermediate mass BHs and the role of tidal disruption in the growth of massive BHs., The photospheric magnetic field provides the key boundary conditions for the interplanetary medium, including the solar wind plasma and the interplanetary magnetic field. Thus any changes in the solar interior that affect either the emergence, dispersion, and decay of active region magnetic fields, or the evolution of the quiet Sun fields, can have locally measurable effects. Each solar cycle for which we have sufficient solar and in-situ observations has followed a similar pattern, but in the most recent cycle the solar dynamo has produced a generally weaker photospheric field together with a spatial distribution of photospheric flux that differs from the previous two. The result is distinctive interplanetary conditions with solar wind streams and magnetic fields significantly different from earlier space age cycles, and a better appreciation for variations the dynamo has likely caused (and will cause) in our 'space weather'., We study the heating of charged test particles in three-dimensional numerical simulations of weakly compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence (""Alfvénic turbulence""); we focus on plasmas with comparable thermal and magnetic energy densities, i.e., β ~ 0.1-10. Our results are relevant to particle heating and acceleration in the solar wind, accretion disks onto black holes, and other astrophysics and heliospheric environments. The physics of particle heating depends on whether the gyrofrequency of a particle Ω<SUB>0</SUB> is comparable to the frequency of a turbulent fluctuation ω that is resolved on the computational domain. Particles with Ω<SUB>0</SUB> ~ ω undergo strong perpendicular heating (relative to the local magnetic field) and pitch angle scattering. By contrast, particles with Ω<SUB>0</SUB> Gt ω undergo strong parallel heating. Simulations with a finite resistivity produce additional parallel heating due to parallel electric fields in small-scale current sheets. Many of our results are consistent with linear theory predictions for the particle heating produced by the Alfvén and slow magnetosonic waves that make up Alfvénic turbulence. However, in contrast to linear theory predictions, energy exchange is not dominated by discrete resonances between particles and waves; instead, the resonances are substantially ""broadened."" We discuss the implications of our results for solar and astrophysics problems, in particular, the thermodynamics of the near-Earth solar wind. This requires an extrapolation of our results to higher numerical resolution, because the dynamic range that can be simulated is far less than the true dynamic range between the proton cyclotron frequency and the outer-scale frequency of MHD turbulence. We conclude that Alfvénic turbulence produces significant parallel heating via the interaction between particles and magnetic field compressions (""slow waves""). However, on scales above the proton Larmor radius Alfvénic turbulence does not produce significant perpendicular heating of protons or minor ions (this is consistent with linear theory, but inconsistent with previous claims from test particle simulations). Instead, the Alfvén wave energy cascades to perpendicular scales below the proton Larmor radius, initiating a kinetic Alfvén wave cascade., We present current results from the Automated Real-Time Imaging System (ARTIS), a software system that allows for rapid reduction of interferometer data at the Allen Telescope Array (ATA). ARTIS supports automated processing for both continuum and spectral line observations, and is capable of supporting wide-field surveys. Motivation for this system arises from both the volume of data produced at the ATA and the need for timely results from observations. The ATA is capable of producing hundreds of gigabytes of data, and covering thousands of square degrees of the sky in a single day. The ATA has also embarked upon several surveys searching for transient events, making quick and reliable automated analysis essential for scientific work. ARTIS (and its affiliated software) has been used for a number of large-scale observations, including transient, HI and maser surveys. ARTIS is also producing real-time data quality measurements for observations, allowing for more robust observing., The baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) method for constraining the expansion history is adversely affected by nonlinear structure formation, which washes out the correlation function peak created at decoupling. To increase the constraining power of low z baryon acoustic oscillation experiments, it has been proposed that one use the observed distribution of galaxies to “reconstruct” the acoustic peak. Recently Padmanabhan, White, and Cohn provided an analytic formalism for understanding how reconstruction works within the context of Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT). We extend that formalism to include the case of biased tracers of the mass in real space and, because the quantitative validity of LPT is questionable, we investigate reconstruction in N-body simulations. We find that LPT does a good job of explaining the trends seen in simulations for both the mass and for biased tracers in real space and comment upon the implications this has for reconstruction., Magnetic fields and charged particles are difficult for school children, the general public, and scientists alike to visualize. But studies of planetary magnetospheres and ionospheres have broad implications for planetary evolution, from the deep interior to the ancient climate, that are important to communicate to each of these audiences. This presentation will highlight the visualization materials that we are developing to educate audiences on the magnetic fields of planets and how they affect atmospheres. The visualization materials that we are developing consist of simplified data sets that can be displayed on spherical projection systems and portable 3-D rigid models of planetary magnetic fields.We are developing presentations for science museums and classrooms that relate fundamental information about the Martian magnetic field, how it differs from Earth’s, and why the differences are significant., We present the first results of a program to characterize the disk and envelope structure of typical Class 0 protostars in nearby low-mass star-forming regions. We use Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) mid-infrared spectra, high-resolution Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) 230 GHz continuum imaging, and two-dimensional radiative transfer models to constrain the envelope structure, as well as the size and mass of the circumprotostellar disk in Serpens FIRS 1. The primary envelope parameters (centrifugal radius, outer radius, outflow opening angle, and inclination) are well constrained by the spectral energy distribution (SED), including Spitzer IRAC and MIPS photometry, IRS spectra, and 1.1 mm Bolocam photometry. These together with the excellent uv-coverage (4.5-500 kλ) of multiple antenna configurations with CARMA allow for a robust separation of the envelope and a resolved disk. The SED of Serpens FIRS 1 is best fit by an envelope with the density profile of a rotating, collapsing spheroid with an inner (centrifugal) radius of approximately 600 AU, and the millimeter data by a large resolved disk with M<SUB>disk</SUB> ~ 1.0 M <SUB>sun</SUB> and R<SUB>disk</SUB> ~ 300 AU. These results suggest that large, massive disks can be present early in the main accretion phase. Results for the larger, unbiased sample of Class 0 sources in the Perseus, Serpens, and Ophiuchus molecular clouds are needed to determine if relatively massive disks are typical in the Class 0 stage., We observed (22) Kalliope and its companion Linus with the integral-field spectrograph OSIRIS, which is coupled to the adaptive optics system at the W.M. Keck 2 telescope on March 25, 2008. We present, for the first time, component-resolved spectra acquired simultaneously in each of the Zbb (1-1.18 μm), Jbb (1.18-1.42 μm), Hbb (1.47-1.80 μm), and Kbb (1.97-2.38 μm) bands. The spectra of the two bodies are remarkably similar and imply that both bodies were formed at the same time from the same material; such as via incomplete re-accretion after a major impact on the precursor body., Observations of timing sequences of substorms expected in various onset mechanisms are examined by using a space-time diagram, which correlates observed space signatures and auroral signatures on the ground during substorm onset. Results from a statistical study of 11 substorms show that signatures in the midtail (x ∼ 15-25 R<SUB>E</SUB>) typically occur before the ground signatures and those in the near-Earth tail (x ∼ 10 R<SUB>E</SUB>) and that signatures in the midtail region observed prior to the substorm onset often occur at a time which was shorter than that expected from MHD wave propagation between the different regions. This suggests that the disturbance onsets in different active regions do not seem to have a simple causal relationship between them as described by the reconnection or current disruption models of substorms. The activation of perturbed fields and plasma flows in space including the signatures of reconnection and current disruption may occur in multiple localized regions throughout the stressed tail current sheet. The activation seems to be continuously observed well after the substorm onset. These results to some extent are consistent with suggested global Alfvénic interaction considerations, in which the substorm onset is the result of Alfvénic interaction in the global current systems., The South Pole Telescope (SPT), like its precursor experiment APEX-SZ, makes mm-wavelength observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Both of these experiments utilize large-scale bolometer arrays with Frequency-Domain Multiplexing to read out multiple TES bolometers with one SQUID. Though Frequency-Domain Multiplexing was successfully demonstrated well before the deployment of the SPT, there were many system level details that needed to be dealt with when transitioning from a small-scale ``proof-of-principle'' system to a full kilo-pixel array that has to operate reliably in the field. These changes vary in scope from the thermal design of the bolometers themselves, to the SQUID feedback electronics and the software used to operate these electronics. In this paper we describe some of the systems-engineering details involved in building a multiplexed instrument such as the SPT receiver., The intracluster medium (ICM) is stably stratified in the hydrodynamic sense with the entropy s increasing outwards. However, thermal conduction along magnetic field lines fundamentally changes the stability of the ICM, leading to the ``heat-flux buoyancy instability'' when dT/dr&gt;0 and the ``magnetothermal instability'' when dT/dr&lt;0. The ICM is thus buoyantly unstable regardless of the signs of dT/dr and ds/dr. On the other hand, these temperature-gradient-driven instabilities saturate by reorienting the magnetic field (perpendicular to r̂ when dT/dr&gt;0 and parallel to r̂ when dT/dr&lt;0), without generating sustained convection. We show that after an anisotropically conducting plasma reaches this nonlinearly stable magnetic configuration, it experiences a buoyant restoring force that resists further distortions of the magnetic field. This restoring force is analogous to the buoyant restoring force experienced by a stably stratified adiabatic plasma. We argue that in order for a driving mechanism (e.g, galaxy motions or cosmic-ray buoyancy) to overcome this restoring force and generate turbulence in the ICM, the strength of the driving must exceed a threshold, corresponding to turbulent velocities &gt;~10-100 km/s. For weaker driving, the ICM remains in its nonlinearly stable magnetic configuration, and turbulent mixing is effectively absent. We discuss the implications of these findings for the turbulent diffusion of metals and heat in the ICM., We report the discovery of a multiply lensed Lyα emitter at z = 3.90 behind the massive cluster WARPS J1415.1+3612 at z = 1.026. Images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope using the Advanced Camera for Surveys reveal a complex lensing system that produces a prominent, highly magnified arc and a triplet of smaller arcs grouped tightly around a spectroscopically confirmed cluster member. Spectroscopic observations using the Faint Object Camera and Spectrograph on Subaru confirm strong Lyα emission in the source galaxy and provide the redshifts for more than 21 cluster members with a velocity dispersion of 807 ± 185 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Assuming a singular isothermal sphere profile, the mass within the Einstein ring (7.13 ± 0farcs38) corresponds to a central velocity dispersion of 686<SUP>+15</SUP> <SUB>-19</SUB> km s<SUP>-1</SUP> for the cluster, consistent with the value estimated from cluster member redshifts. Our mass profile estimate from combining strong lensing and dynamical analyses is in good agreement with both X-ray and weak lensing results. <P />Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the data archive at the Space Telescope Institute. STScI is operated by the association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. under the NASA contract NAS 5-26555. The observations are associated with program 10496., Tidal forcing at diurnal periods drives a flow in the liquid cores of planets, altering the nutation of these bodies. An approximate description of the flow in an inviscid fluid is comprised of a uniform vorticity and a potential flow to satisfy boundary conditions. This flow (often called Poincare flow) is unable to satisfy boundary conditions when the solid inner core tilts relative to the mantle or when the ellipticity of the inner-core boundary differs from the ellipticity of the core-mantle boundary. A numerical solution is used to show that internal shear layers develop when Poincare flow fails. The thickness of the shear layers scale as E1/3, where E is the Ekman number. The total viscous dissipation also scales as E1/3 when stress-free boundary conditions are assumed. Extrapolating E to realistic values for planetary cores suggests that viscous dissipation is negligible. However, shear layers also induce electric currents when the core is permeated with a magnetic field. Scaling arguments for a weak magnetic field suggest that the resulting ohmic dissipation is proportional to E-2/3. This estimate is supported by numerical calculations with E = 10-4 to 10-6. The singularity at vanishingly small values of E is avoided by the influence of the Lorentz force on the flow. The resulting ohmic dissipation should be detectable in observations of the Earth’s nutation, but it is insufficient to explain all of the dissipation that is actually observed. Strong magnetic coupling at the core-mantle and inner-core boundaries probably accounts for most of the observed dissipation., We prove that the light-cone time cutoff on the multiverse defines the same probabilities as a causal patch with initial conditions in the longest-lived metastable vacuum. This establishes the equivalence of two measures of eternal inflation which naively appear very different (though both are motivated by holography). The duality can be traced to an underlying geometric relation which we identify., We present Hubble Space Telescope optical coronagraphic polarization imaging observations of the dusty debris disk HD 61005. The scattered light intensity image and polarization structure reveal a highly inclined disk with a clear asymmetric, swept back component, suggestive of significant interaction with the ambient interstellar medium (ISM). The combination of our new data with the published 1.1 μm discovery image shows that the grains are blue scattering with no strong color gradient as a function of radius, implying predominantly submicron-sized grains. We investigate possible explanations that could account for the observed swept back, asymmetric morphology. Previous work has suggested that HD 61005 may be interacting with a cold, unusually dense interstellar cloud. However, limits on the intervening interstellar gas column density from an optical spectrum of HD 61005 in the Na I D lines render this possibility unlikely. Instead, HD 61005 may be embedded in a more typical warm, low-density cloud that introduces secular perturbations to dust grain orbits. This mechanism can significantly distort the ensemble disk structure within a typical cloud crossing time. For a counterintuitive relative flow direction—parallel to the disk midplane—we find that the structures generated by these distortions can very roughly approximate the HD 61005 morphology. Future observational studies constraining the direction of the relative ISM flow will thus provide an important constraint for future modeling. Independent of the interpretation for HD 61005, we expect that interstellar gas drag likely plays a role in producing asymmetries observed in other debris disk systems, such as HD 15115 and δ Velorum., We study a statistical model defined by a conformally invariant distribution of overlapping spheres in arbitrary dimension d. The model arises as the asymptotic distribution of cosmic bubbles in d+1 dimensional de Sitter space, and also as the asymptotic distribution of bubble collisions with the domain wall of a fiducial ``observation bubble'' in d+2 dimensional de Sitter space. In this note we calculate the 2-, 3-, and 4-point correlation functions of exponentials of the ``bubble number operator'' analytically in d = 2. We find that these correlators are free of infrared divergences, covariant under the global conformal group, charge conserving, and transform with positive conformal dimensions that are related in a novel way to the charge. Although by themselves these operators probably do not define a full-fledged conformal field theory, one can use the partition function on a sphere to compute an approximate central charge in the 2D case. The theory in any dimension has a noninteracting limit when the nucleation rate of the bubbles in the bulk is very large. The theory in two dimensions is related to some models of continuum percolation, but it is conformal for all values of the tunneling rate., In this work, we present the first results of our imaging campaign at Keck Observatory to identify the host galaxies of ""dark"" gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), events with no detected optical afterglow or with detected optical flux significantly fainter than expected from the observed X-ray afterglow. We find that out of a uniform sample of 29 Swift bursts rapidly observed by the Palomar 60 inch telescope through 2008 March (14 of which we classify as dark), all events have either a detected optical afterglow, a probable optical host-galaxy detection, or both. Our results constrain the fraction of Swift GRBs coming from very high redshift (z&gt;7), such as the recent GRB 090423, to between 0.2% and 7% at 80% confidence. In contrast, a significant fraction of the sample requires large extinction columns (host-frame A<SUB>V</SUB> gsim 1 mag, with several events showing A<SUB>V</SUB> &gt; 2-6 mag), identifying dust extinction as the dominant cause of the dark GRB phenomenon. We infer that a significant fraction of GRBs (and, by association, of high-mass star formation) occurs in highly obscured regions. However, the host galaxies of dark GRBs seem to have normal optical colors, suggesting that the source of obscuring dust is local to the vicinity of the GRB progenitor or highly unevenly distributed within the host galaxy., The NSF-funded CINEMA mission will provide cutting-edge magnetospheric science and critical space weather measurements, including high sensitivity mapping and high cadence movies of ring current, &gt;4 keV Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA), as well as in situ measurements of suprathermal electrons (&gt;~2 keV) and ions (&gt;~ 4 keV) in the auroral and ring current precipitation regions, all with ~1 keV FWHM resolution and uniform response up to ~100 keV. A Suprathermal Electron, Ion, Neutral (STEIN) instrument adds an electrostatic deflection system to the STEREO STE (SupraThermal Electron) 4-pixel silicon semiconductor sensor to separate ions from electrons and from ENAs up to ~20 keV. In addition, inboard and outboard (on an extendable 1m boom) magnetoresistive sensor magnetometers will provide high cadence 3-axis magnetic field measurements. A new attitude control system (ACS) uses torque coils, a solar aspect sensor and the magnetometers to de-tumble the 3u CINEMA spacecraft, then spin it up to ~1 rpm with the spin axis perpendicular to the ecliptic, so STEIN can sweep across most of the sky every minute. Ideally, CINEMA will be placed into a high inclination low earth orbit that crosses the auroral zone and cusp. An S-band transmitter will be used to provide &gt; ~8 kbps orbit-average data downlink to the ~11m diameter antenna of the Berkeley Ground Station. Two more identical CINEMA spacecraft will be built by Kyung Hee University (KHU) in Korea under their World Class University (WCU) program, to provide stereo ENA imaging and multi-point in situ measurements. Furthermore, CINEMA’s development of miniature particle and magnetic field sensors, and cubesat-size spinning spacecraft will be important for future nanosatellite space missions., Liquid phase diffusion experiments were carried out to determine whether diffusive isotopic fractionation of a major chemical element (Ca) varies with chemical composition in high-temperature molten silicates. The objective was to determine how differences in silicate liquid structure, such as the ratio of bridging to non-bridging oxygen atoms, as well as bulk transport properties such as viscosity, relate to isotope discrimination during diffusion. This information, in turn, may relate to the lifetimes and sizes of multi-atom structures in the liquid. Diffusion couples consisting of juxtaposed natural mafic and felsic liquids were held at T = 1450 °C and P = 1.0 GPa for durations of 12-24 h in a standard piston-cylinder assembly. Experiments were done using different mafic endmember compositions (two tholeiitic basalts and a ugandite) and a single rhyolite composition. Major-element diffusion profiles and Ca isotope profiles were measured on the recovered quenched glasses. The starting materials were isotopically indistinguishable, but <SUP>44</SUP>Ca/ <SUP>40</SUP>Ca variations of ca. 5‰ arose due to a mass dependence of the Ca diffusion coefficients. Results indicate that the mass dependence of Ca diffusion coefficients varies with the magnitude and direction of aluminum gradients and the viscosity of the liquid. Some Ca fractionations result mainly from Al gradients. A simplified multicomponent diffusion model was used to model the experimental results. The model allows for diffusion of Ca in response to gradients in the concentrations of both CaO as well as Al <SUB>2</SUB>O <SUB>3</SUB>, and the model results are consistent with the inferred existence of at least two distinct species of Ca. The magnitude of isotopic discrimination during diffusion also appears to be stronger on the rhyolite versus the basalt/ugandite side of diffusion couples. The results can largely be accounted for by an adaptation of the model of Dingwell (1990), whereby in high silica liquids, Ca diffuses largely by site hopping through a quasi-stationary aluminosilicate matrix, producing strong isotopic effects because the Ca diffusion is not strongly correlated with the movement of the framework atoms. In low-silica liquids, Ca diffusion is correlated with the movement of the other components and there is less mass discrimination. Combining our Ca results with Ca, Mg, and Li data from previous studies, we show that this model can explain most of the cation- and composition-dependence of diffusive isotopic fractionations observed thus far. A key parameter controlling isotopic discrimination is the ratio of the elemental (Ca, Mg, Li) diffusivity to the Eyring (or Si) diffusivity. However, all experiments done so far also exhibit isotopic features that are not yet fully explained; some of these may relate to small temperature gradients in the capsules, or to more complex coupling effects that are not captured in simplified diffusion models., Using hard X-ray observations from the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI), we investigate the reliability of spectral hardening during solar flares as an indicator of related solar energetic particle (SEP) events at Earth. All RHESSI data are analyzed, from 2002 February through the end of Solar Cycle 23, thereby expanding upon recent work on a smaller sample of flares. Previous investigations have found very high success when associating soft-hard-harder (SHH) spectral behavior with energetic proton events, and confirmation of this link would suggest a correlation between electron acceleration in solar flares and SEPs seen in interplanetary space. In agreement with these past findings, we find that of 37 magnetically well-connected flares (W30-W90), 12 of 18 flares with SHH behavior produced SEP events and none of 19 flares without SHH behavior produced SEPs. This demonstrates a statistically significant dependence of SHH and SEP observations, a link that is unexplained in the standard scenario of SEP acceleration at the shock front of coronal mass ejections and encourages further investigation of the mechanisms which could be responsible., Plagioclase is not only the most abundant mineral in the Earth's crust, but is present in almost all terrestrial tectonic settings and is widespread in most extraterrestrial material. Applying the K-Ar system to this common mineral would provide a powerful tool for quantifying thermal histories in a wide variety of settings. Nonetheless, plagioclase has rarely been used for thermochronometry, largely due to difficulties in simultaneously acquiring precise geochronologic data and quantifying argon diffusion kinetics from a mineral with low-K concentration. Here we describe an analytical technique that generates high-precision <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar data and quantifies Ar diffusion kinetics of low-K minerals. We present results of five diffusion experiments conducted on single crystals of plagioclase from the Bushveld Complex, South Africa. The observed diffusion kinetics yield internally consistent thermochronological constraints, indicating that plagioclase is a reliable thermochronometer. Individual grains have activation energies of 155-178 kJ/mol and ln( D<SUB>0</SUB>/ a<SUP>2</SUP>) varies between 3.5 and 6.5. These diffusion parameters correspond to closure temperatures of 225-300 °C, for a 10 °C/Ma cooling rate. Age spectra generally conform to single-domain diffusive loss profiles, suggesting that grain-scale diffusion dominates argon transport in this fairly simple plagioclase. Conjointly examining several single-grain analyses enables us to distinguish episodic reheating from slow cooling and indicates that the Bushveld Complex cooled rapidly and monotonically from magmatic temperature to &lt;300 °C over 3 Ma, followed by protracted cooling to ambient crustal temperatures of 150-200 °C over ∼600 Ma., Using an asymptotic methodology, including an expansion in inverse powers of , where ω is the frequency, we derive a solution for flow in a medium with pressure dependent properties. The solution is valid for a heterogeneous medium with smoothly varying properties. That is, the scale length of the heterogeneity must be significantly larger then the scale length over which the pressure increases from it initial value to its peak value. The solution is in the form of a travelling disturbance and is defined along a trajectory through the medium, similar to a ray. The expression for pseudo-phase, which is related to the `traveltime' of the transient pressure disturbance, and the expression for pressure amplitude contain modifications due to the pressure dependence of the medium. We apply the method to synthetic and observed pressure variations in a deforming medium. In the synthetic test we model 1-D propagation in a pressure-dependent medium. Comparisons with both an analytic self-similar solution and the results of a numerical simulation indicate general agreement. Furthermore, we are able to match pressure variations observed during a pulse test at the Coaraze Laboratory site in France., We estimated photospheric velocities by separately applying the Fourier Local Correlation Tracking and Differential Affine Velocity Estimator methods to 2708 co-registered pairs of SOHO/MDI magnetograms, with nominal 96 minute cadence and ~2'' pixels, from 46 active regions (ARs) from 1996 to 1998 over the time interval τ<SUB>45</SUB> when each AR was within 45° of disk center. For each magnetogram pair, we computed the reprojected, average estimated radial magnetic field, \tilde{B}_R; and each tracking method produced an independently estimated flow field, u. We then quantitatively characterized these magnetic and flow fields by computing several extensive and intensive properties of each; extensive properties scale with AR size, while intensive properties do not depend directly on AR size. Intensive flow properties included moments of speeds, horizontal divergences, and radial curls; extensive flow properties included sums of these properties over each AR, and a crude proxy for the ideal Poynting flux, S_R = \sum |{u}| \tilde{B}_R^2. Several quantities derived from \tilde{B}_R were also computed, including: Φ, the total unsigned flux; R, a measure of the unsigned flux near strong-field polarity inversion lines; and \sum \tilde{B}_R^2. Next, using correlation and discriminant analysis, we investigated the associations between these properties and flares from the GOES flare catalog, when averaged over both τ<SUB>45</SUB> and shorter time windows of 6 and 24 hr. Our AR sample included both flaring and flare-quiet ARs; the latter did not flare above GOES C1.0 level during τ<SUB>45</SUB>. Among magnetic properties, we found R to be most strongly associated with flare flux. Among extensive flow properties, the proxy Poynting flux, S<SUB>R</SUB> , was most strongly associated with flare flux, at a level comparable to that of R. All intensive flow properties studied were more poorly associated with flare flux than these extensive properties. Past flare activity was also associated with future flare occurrence. The largest coefficients of determination from correlations with flare flux that we performed are ~0.25, implying no single variable that we considered can explain the majority of variability in average flare flux., Thermal convection is an effective mechanism for producing seismic anisotropy in many regions of the Earth. However, it is not known whether this mechanism is relevant for the anisotropy observed in the inner core. Here we establish the requirements for convection in the inner core by combining a simple model for inner-core growth with a solution for conductive cooling. Thermal convection is likely during the early stages of inner-core growth, but becomes less probable as the volume of the inner core increases. The transition to a non-convecting state is driven by changes in both the thermal and compositional stratification. A decrease in the vigour of convection near the transition to a non-convecting state isolates the pattern of flow with the lowest critical Rayleigh number Ra<SUB>c</SUB>. We apply a perturbation method based on Rayleigh's principle to calculate Ra<SUB>c</SUB> in a hydrostatically flattened inner core. We find that the final pattern of flow is characterized by a degree l = 1 mode in which the axis of upwelling aligns with the rotation axis. This pattern of flow has the symmetry required to explain the distribution of anisotropy at the largest scales. The extent of crystal alignment depends on the level of stress during this final convective state. One possible interpretation of the observed anisotropy is that the final convective state establishes the large scale crystal alignment without completely erasing a more complicated texture that developed when convection was more vigorous., A simultaneous observation of an auroral spiral and its generator region in the near-Earth plasma sheet is rather unlikely. Here we present such observations using the THEMIS spacecraft as well as the THEMIS ground network of all-sky imagers and magnetometers. Two consecutive auroral spirals separated by approximately 14 min occurred during a substorm on 19 February 2008. The spirals formed during the expansion phase and a subsequent intensification, and were among the brightest features in the aurora with diameters of 200-300 km. The duration for the formation and decay of each spiral was less than 60 s. Both spirals occurred shortly after the formation of two oppositely rotating plasma flow vortices in space, which were also accompanied by dipolarizations and ion injections, at ~11 R<SUB>E</SUB> geocentric distance. Observations and model calculations also give evidence for a magnetic-field-aligned current generation of approximately 0.1 MA via the flow vortices, connecting the generator region of the spirals with the ionosphere, during the formation of both spirals. In the ionosphere, a pair of equivalent ionospheric current (EIC) vortices with opposite rotations (corresponding to upward and downward currents) was present during both auroral spirals with enhanced EICs and ionospheric flows at the locations of the auroral spirals and along the auroral arcs. The combined ground and space observations suggest that each auroral spiral was powered by two oppositely rotating plasma flow vortices that caused a current enhancement in the substorm current wedge., Cosmic-rays with energies up to 3×10<SUP>20</SUP>eV have been observed. The nuclear composition of these cosmic rays is unknown but if the incident nuclei are protons then the corresponding center of mass energy is s<SUB></SUB>=700TeV. High energy muons can be used to probe the composition of these incident nuclei. The energy spectra of high-energy (&gt;1TeV) cosmic ray induced muons have been measured with deep underground or under-ice detectors. These muons come from pion and kaon decays and from charm production in the atmosphere. Terrestrial experiments are most sensitive to far-forward muons so the production rates are sensitive to high-x partons in the incident nucleus and low-x partons in the nitrogen/oxygen targets. Muon measurements can complement the central-particle data collected at colliders. This paper will review muon production data and discuss some non-perturbative (soft) models that have been used to interpret the data. I will show measurements of TeV muon transverse momentum (p<SUB></SUB>) spectra in cosmic-ray air showers from MACRO, and describe how the IceCube neutrino observatory and the proposed Km3Net detector will extend these measurements to a higher p<SUB></SUB> region where perturbative QCD should apply. With a 1 km<SUP>2</SUP> surface area, the full IceCube detector should observe hundreds of muons/year with p<SUB></SUB> in the pQCD regime., We present evidence for condensed-phase methane precipitation near Xanadu using nine nights of observations from the SINFONI integral-field spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope and imaging analysis with empirical surface subtraction. Radiative transfer models are used to support the imaging technique by simulating the spectrometer datacubes and testing for variations in both the surface reflectivity spectrum and atmospheric opacity. We use the models and observations together to argue against artifacts that may arise in the image analysis. High phase angle observations from Cassini/VIMS are used to test against surface scattering artifacts that may be confused with sources of atmospheric opacity. Although changes in the surface reflectivity spectrum can reproduce observations from a particular viewing geometry on a given night, multiple observations are best modeled by condensed-phase methane opacity near the surface. These observations and modeling indicate that the condensed-phase methane opacity observed with this technique occurs predominantly near Xanadu and is most likely due to precipitation., We present Mars Global Surveyor measurements of bipolar out-of-plane magnetic fields at current sheets in Mars' magnetosphere. These signatures match predictions from simulations and terrestrial observations of collisionless magnetic reconnection, and could similarly indicate differential ion and electron motion and the resulting Hall current systems near magnetic X lines. Thus, these observations may represent passages through or very near reconnection diffusion regions at Mars. Out of 28 events found at 400 km altitude with well-defined current sheet orientations, 26 have magnetic fields consistent with the expected polarities of Hall fields near diffusion regions. For these events, we find an average ratio of Hall field to main field of 0.51 ± 0.13, and an average ratio of normal to main field (reconnection rate) of 0.16 ± 0.09, consistent with terrestrial observations of reconnection. These events do not consistently correlate with the location of crustal fields or with IMF reversals, indicating that magnetic field draping alone (perhaps enhanced by high solar wind dynamic pressure) may generate current sheets capable of reconnection. For some events, we observe field-aligned electrons that may carry parallel currents that close the Hall current loop. Electron distributions around current sheets often indicate magnetic connection to the collisional exosphere. For crossings sunward of the X line, we usually observe an electron flux minimum at the current sheet, consistent with the resulting closed magnetic structure. For crossings antisunward of the X line, we do not observe flux minima, consistent with field lines open downstream. Collisionless reconnection, if common at Mars, could represent a significant atmospheric loss process., The night side ionosphere of Mars is known to be highly variable: essentially nonexistent in certain geographic locations, while occasionally nearly as strong as the photoionization-produced dayside ionosphere in others. The factors controlling its structure include thermospheric densities, temperatures and winds, day-night plasma transport, plasma temperatures, current systems, solar particle events, crustal magnetic fields, and electron precipitation, none of which are adequately understood at present. Using a kinetic Monte Carlo approach called Mars Monte Carlo Electron Transport (MarMCET), we model the dynamics of precipitating solar wind electrons on the nightside ionosphere of Mars to study the effects of these last two factors on ionospheric density and structure. We calculate ionization rate profiles and, using simple assumptions concerning atmospheric chemistry, also calculate electron density profiles, total electron content, and equivalent ionosphere slab thickness. We present the first model investigation of the coupled effects of crustal magnetic field gradients and precipitating electron pitch angle distributions (PADs). Including such effects, particularly in cases of nonisotropic PADs, is found to be essential in accurately predicting ionization rate and electron density profiles: peak ionization rates can vary by a factor of 20 or more when these effects are included., The proton temperature anisotropy in the solar wind is known to be constrained by the theoretical thresholds for pressure-anisotropy-driven instabilities. Here, we use approximately 1×10<SUP>6</SUP> independent measurements of gyroscale magnetic fluctuations in the solar wind to show for the first time that these fluctuations are enhanced along the temperature anisotropy thresholds of the mirror, proton oblique firehose, and ion cyclotron instabilities. In addition, the measured magnetic compressibility is enhanced at high plasma beta (β<SUB>∥</SUB>≳1) along the mirror instability threshold but small elsewhere, consistent with expectations of the mirror mode. We also show that the short wavelength magnetic fluctuation power is a strong function of collisionality, which relaxes the temperature anisotropy away from the instability conditions and reduces correspondingly the fluctuation power., Using CARMA, we imaged the 87 GHz SiO v = 0 J = 2-1 line toward Orion-KL with 0farcs45 angular resolution. The maps indicate that radio source I drives a bipolar outflow into the surrounding molecular cloud along a NE-SW axis, in agreement with the model of Greenhill et al. The extended high-velocity outflow from Orion-KL appears to be a continuation of this compact outflow. High-velocity gas extends farthest along a NW-SE axis, suggesting that the outflow direction changes on timescales of a few hundred years., The kinematics of newly formed star clusters are interesting both as a probe of the state of the gas clouds from which the stars form, and because they influence planet formation, stellar mass segregation, cluster disruption, and other processes controlled in part by dynamical interactions in young clusters. However, to date there have been no attempts to use simulations of star cluster formation to investigate how the kinematics of young stars change in response to variations in the properties of their parent molecular clouds. In this Letter, we report the results of turbulent self-gravitating simulations of cluster formation in which we consider both clouds in virial balance and those undergoing global collapse. We find that stars in these simulations generally have velocity dispersions smaller than that of the gas by a factor of ~5, independent of the dynamical state of the parent cloud, so that subvirial stellar velocity dispersions arise naturally even in virialized molecular clouds. The simulated clusters also show large-scale stellar velocity gradients of ~0.2-2 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> pc<SUP>-1</SUP> and strong correlations between the centroid velocities of stars and gas, both of which are observed in young clusters. We conclude that star clusters should display subvirial velocity dispersions, large-scale velocity gradients, and strong gas-star velocity correlations regardless of whether their parent clouds are in virial balance, and, conversely, that observations of these features cannot be used to infer the dynamical state of the parent gas clouds., An asymptotic method, valid in the presence of smoothly varying heterogeneity, is used to derive a semi-analytic solution to the equations for fluid and solid displacements in a poroelastic medium. The solution is defined along trajectories through the porous medium model, in the manner of ray theory. The lowest order expression in the asymptotic expansion provides an eikonal equation for the phase. There are three modes of propagation, two modes of longitudinal displacement and a single mode of transverse displacement. The two longitudinal modes define the Biot fast and slow waves which have very different propagation characteristics. In the limit of low frequency, the Biot slow wave propagates as a diffusive disturbance, in essence a transient pressure pulse. Conversely, at low frequencies the Biot fast wave and the transverse mode are modified elastic waves. At intermediate frequencies the wave characteristics of the longitudinal modes are mixed. A comparison of the asymptotic solution with analytic and numerical solutions shows reasonably good agreement for both homogeneous and heterogeneous earth models., We investigate fluid motions near the midplane of vertically stratified accretion disks with highly resistive midplanes. In such disks, the magnetorotational instability drives turbulence in thin layers surrounding a resistive, stable dead zone. The turbulent layers in turn drive motions in the dead zone. We examine the properties of these motions using three-dimensional, stratified, local, shearing-box, non-ideal, magnetohydrodynamical simulations. Although the turbulence in the active zones provides a source of vorticity to the midplane, no evidence for coherent vortices is found in our simulations. It appears that this is because of strong vertical oscillations in the dead zone. By analyzing time series of azimuthally averaged flow quantities, we identify an axisymmetric wave mode particular to models with dead zones. This mode is reduced in amplitude, but not suppressed entirely, by changing the equation of state from isothermal to ideal. These waves are too low frequency to affect sedimentation of dust to the midplane, but may have significance for the gravitational stability of the resulting midplane dust layers., We use the extensive catalogue of dark matter haloes from the Millennium Simulation to investigate the statistics of the mass accretion histories (MAHs) and accretion rates of ~500000 haloes from redshift z = 0 to 6. We find only about 25 per cent of the haloes to have MAHs that are well described by a 1-parameter exponential form. For the rest of the haloes, between 20 per cent (Milky Way mass) and 50 per cent (cluster mass) experience late-time growth that is steeper than an exponential, whereas the remaining haloes show plateaued late-time growth that is shallower than an exponential. The haloes with slower late-time growth tend to reside in denser environments, suggesting that either tidal stripping or the `hotter' dynamics are suppressing the accretion rate of dark matter on to these haloes. These deviations from exponential growth are well fit by introducing a second parameter: M(z) ~ (1 + z)<SUP>β</SUP>e<SUP>-γz</SUP>. The full distribution of β and γ as a function of halo mass is provided. From the analytic form of M(z), we obtain a simple formula for the mean accretion rate of dark matter, , as a function of redshift and mass. At z = 0, this rate is 42M<SUB>solar</SUB>yr<SUP>-1</SUP> for 10<SUP>12</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB> haloes, which corresponds to a mean baryon accretion rate of . This mean rate increases approximately as (1 + z)<SUP>1.5</SUP> at low z and (1 + z)<SUP>2.5</SUP> at high z, reaching and 140M<SUB>solar</SUB>yr<SUP>-1</SUP> at z = 1, 2 and 3. The specific rate depends on halo mass weakly: . Results for the broad distributions about the mean rates are also discussed., We investigate the parameter space of two-field inflation models where inflation terminates via a first-order phase transition causing nucleation of bubbles. Such models experience a tension from the need to ensure nearly scale-invariant density perturbations, while avoiding a near scale-invariant bubble size distribution which would conflict observations. We perform an exact analysis of the different regimes of the models, where the energy density of the inflaton field ranges from being negligible as compared to the vacuum energy to providing most of the energy for inflation. Despite recent microwave anisotropy results favoring a spectral index less than 1, we find that there are still viable models that end with bubble production and can match all available observations. As a by-product of our analysis, we also provide an up-to-date assessment of the viable parameter space of Linde’s original second-order hybrid model across its full parameter range., Arctic warming is expected to increase thermokarst erosion in thaw lakes, thus inducing large emissions of CH<SUB>4</SUB> to the atmosphere. To reduce uncertainties about the mechanisms, magnitude and timing of methane emissions, we conducted an in-situ experiment to simulate lake expansion following thermokarst erosion. Three tundra horizons were excavated, incubated at the bottom of a thaw lake and subsequently monitored for CH<SUB>4</SUB> ebullition from mid-season until lake freeze-up. Although the permafrost and seasonally frozen active layer emitted little CH<SUB>4</SUB> throughout the experiment, ebullition from the thawed active layer began the first week, quickly reaching rates (39 mg CH<SUB>4</SUB> m<SUP>-2</SUP> day<SUP>-1</SUP>) comparable to background ebullition in Siberian thaw lakes. While the long-term fate of permafrost carbon from thermokarst lake expansion remains uncertain, the short-term methane release is dominated by upper active layer carbon. Thus, deepening of the upper active layer in a thaw lake dominated landscape should increase CH<SUB>4</SUB> ebullition rates., , , In supersymmetric unified theories the dark matter particle can decay, just like the proton, through grand unified interactions with a lifetime of order of ∼10<SUP>26</SUP>sec. Its decay products can be detected by several experiments—including Fermi, HESS, PAMELA, ATIC, and IceCube—opening our first direct window to physics at the TeV scale and simultaneously at the unification scale ∼10<SUP>16</SUP>GeV. We consider possibilities for explaining the electron/positron spectra observed by HESS, PAMELA, and ATIC, and the resulting predictions for the gamma-ray, electron/positron, and neutrino spectra as will be measured, for example, by Fermi and IceCube. The discovery of an isotropic, hard gamma ray spectral feature at Fermi would be strong evidence for dark matter and would disfavor astrophysical sources such as pulsars. Substructure in the cosmic ray spectra probes the spectroscopy of new TeV-mass particles. For example, a preponderance of electrons in the final state can result from the lightness of selectrons relative to squarks. Decaying dark matter acts as a sparticle injector with an energy reach potentially higher than the LHC. The resulting cosmic ray flux depends only on the values of the weak and unification scales., The Spitzer Space Telescope has been a remarkably successful platform for studies of exoplanet atmospheres, with notable results including the first detection of the light emitted by an extrasolar planet, the first spectrum of an extrasolar planet, and the first map of the flux distribution across the surface of an extrasolar planet. These observations have allowed us to study the pressure-temperature profiles, chemistry, clouds, and circulation patterns of a select subset of the massive, close-in planets known as hot Jupiters, along with the hot Saturn HD 149026b and the cooler Neptune-mass planet GJ 436b. These planets have properties that differ substantially from those of their solar system counterparts and therefore provide an invaluable opportunity to extend our observations of planetary atmospheres to a wide range of environments. In my talk I will review the current status of Spitzer observations of transiting planets at the end of the cryogenic mission and look ahead to the observations planned for the two-year warm mission, which began in the summer of 2009 after the last of Spitzer's cryogen was exhausted., In this paper, we present a study of the scaling properties and intermittency of solar wind MHD turbulence based on the use of wavelet transforms. More specifically, we use the Haar Wavelet transform on simultaneous 3 s resolution particle and magnetic field data from the Wind spacecraft, to investigate anomalous scaling and intermittency effects of both magnetic field and solar wind velocity fluctuations in the inertial range. For this purpose, we calculated spectra, structure functions, and probability distribution functions. We show that this powerful wavelet technique allows for a systematic elimination of intermittency effects on spectra and structure functions and thus for a clear determination of the actual scaling properties in the inertial range. The scaling of the magnetic field and the velocity fluctuations are found to be fundamentally different. Moreover, when the most intermittent structures superposed to the standard fluctuations are removed, simple statistics are recovered. The magnetic field and the velocity fluctuations exhibit a well-defined, although different, monofractal behavior, following a Kolmogorov -5/3 scaling and a Iroshnikov-Kraichnan -3/2 scaling, respectively. The multifractal properties of solar wind turbulence appear to be determined by the presence of those most intermittent structures. Finally, our wavelet technique also allows for a direct and systematic identification of the most active, singular structures responsible for the intermittency in the solar wind., Forming stars emit a substantial amount of radiation into their natal environment. We use ORION, an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) three-dimensional gravito-radiation-hydrodyanics code, to simulate low-mass star formation in a turbulent molecular cloud. We compare the distributions of stellar masses, accretion rates, and temperatures in the cases with and without radiative transfer, and we demonstrate that radiative feedback has a profound effect on accretion, multiplicity, and mass by reducing the number of stars formed and the total rate at which gas turns into stars. We also show that once the star formation reaches a steady state, protostellar radiation is by far the dominant source of energy in the simulation, exceeding viscous dissipation and compressional heating by at least an order of magnitude. Calculations that omit radiative feedback from protstars significantly underestimate the gas temperature and the strength of this effect. Although heating from protostars is mainly confined to the protostellar cores, we find that it is sufficient to suppress disk fragmentation that would otherwise result in very low-mass companions or brown dwarfs. We demonstrate that the mean protostellar accretion rate increases with the final stellar mass so that the star formation time is only a weak function of mass., We show that between 1996 and 2006, the area circumscribed by the high-speed collar of the Great Red Spot (GRS) shrunk by 15%, while the peak velocities within its collar remained constant. This shrinkage indicates a dynamical change in the GRS because the region circumscribed by the collar is nearly coincident with the location of the potential vorticity anomaly of the GRS. It was previously observed that the area of the clouds associated with the GRS has been shrinking. However, the cloud cover of the GRS is not coincident with the location of its potential vorticity anomaly or any other of its known dynamical features. We show that the peak velocities of the Oval BA were nearly the same in 2000, when the Oval was white, and in 2006, when it was red, as were all of the other features of the two velocities fields. To measure temporal changes in the GRS and Oval, we extracted velocities from images taken with Galileo, Cassini, and the Hubble Space Telescope using a new iterative method called Advection Corrected Correlation Image Velocimetry (ACCIV). ACCIV finds correlations over image pairs with 10-h time separations when other automated velocity-extraction methods are limited to time separations of 2 h or less. Typically, ACCIV velocities produced from images separated by 10 h had errors that are 3-6 times smaller than similar velocities extracted from images separated by 2 h or less. ACCIV produces velocity fields containing hundreds of thousands of independent correlation vectors (tie-points). Dense velocity fields are needed to locate the loci of peak velocities and other features., We present strong evidence for dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the z = 0.36 galaxy COSMOS J100043.15+020637.2. COSMOS Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of the galaxy shows a tidal tail, indicating that the galaxy recently underwent a merger, as well as two bright point sources near the galaxy's center. The luminosities of these sources (derived from the HST image) and their emission line flux ratios (derived from Keck/DEIMOS slit spectroscopy) suggest that both are AGNs and not star-forming regions or supernovae. Observations from zCOSMOS, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, XMM-Newton, Spitzer, and the Very Large Array fortify the evidence for AGN activity. With HST imaging we measure a projected spatial offset between the two AGNs of 1.75 ± 0.03 h <SUP>-1</SUP> kpc, and with DEIMOS we measure a 150 ± 40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> line-of-sight velocity offset between the two AGNs. Combined, these observations provide substantial evidence that COSMOS J100043.15+020637.2 is a merger-remnant galaxy with dual AGNs., We present extensive early photometric (ultraviolet through near-infrared) and spectroscopic (optical and near-infrared) data on supernova (SN) 2008D as well as X-ray data analysis on the associated Swift X-ray transient (XRT) 080109. Our data span a time range of 5 hr before the detection of the X-ray transient to 150 days after its detection, and a detailed analysis allowed us to derive constraints on the nature of the SN and its progenitor; throughout we draw comparisons with results presented in the literature and find several key aspects that differ. We show that the X-ray spectrum of XRT 080109 can be fit equally well by an absorbed power law or a superposition of about equal parts of both power law and blackbody. Our data first established that SN 2008D is a spectroscopically normal SN Ib (i.e., showing conspicuous He lines) and showed that SN 2008D had a relatively long rise time of 18 days and a modest optical peak luminosity. The early-time light curves of the SN are dominated by a cooling stellar envelope (for Δt≈0.1-4 days, most pronounced in the blue bands) followed by <SUP>56</SUP>Ni decay. We construct a reliable measurement of the bolometric output for this stripped-envelope SN, and, combined with estimates of E <SUB>K</SUB> and M <SUB>ej</SUB> from the literature, estimate the stellar radius R <SUB>sstarf</SUB> of its probable Wolf-Rayet progenitor. According to the model of Waxman et al. and Chevalier &amp; Fransson, we derive R <SUP>W07</SUP> <SUB>sstarf</SUB> = 1.2 ± 0.7R <SUB>sun</SUB> and R <SUP>CF08</SUP> <SUB>sstarf</SUB> = 12 ± 7 R <SUB>sun</SUB>, respectively; the latter being more in line with typical WN stars. Spectra obtained at three and four months after maximum light show double-peaked oxygen lines that we associate with departures from spherical symmetry, as has been suggested for the inner ejecta of a number of SN Ib cores., There is a deep cosmological mystery: although dependent on very different underlying physics, the time scales of structure formation, of galaxy cooling (both radiatively and against the CMB), and of vacuum domination do not differ by many orders of magnitude, but are all comparable to the present age of the universe. By scanning four landscape parameters simultaneously, we show that this quadruple coincidence is resolved. We assume only that the statistical distribution of parameter values in the multiverse grows towards certain catastrophic boundaries we identify, across which there are drastic regime changes. We find order-of-magnitude predictions for the cosmological constant, the primordial density contrast, the temperature at matter-radiation equality, the typical galaxy mass, and the age of the universe, in terms of the fine structure constant and the electron, proton and Planck masses. Our approach permits a systematic evaluation of measure proposals; with the causal patch measure, we find no runaway of the primordial density contrast and the cosmological constant to large values., It is now about 10 years since the evidence, based on Type Ia supernovae, for the acceleration of the expansion of the Universe was discovered. I will discuss some aspects of the work and events in the Supernova Cosmology Project (SCP), during the period 1988 to 1998, which led to this discovery., We have used Mars Express (MEX) and Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) simultaneous and non-simultaneous measurements to study the Martian plasma environment. In particular, we have derived quantitative expressions for the altitude of the terminator bow shock (BS) and magnetic pileup boundary (MPB) as functions of solar wind dynamic pressure, crustal magnetic fields and solar EUV flux. We have also studied the influence of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) direction. Through simultaneous two-spacecraft case studies we have shown that the dynamic pressure has a strong influence on the location and shape of these boundaries, which is also confirmed through a large statistical study. A higher dynamic pressure pushes the boundaries downward. The IMF direction has a weaker but still significant influence on both boundaries and causes them to move outward in the hemisphere of locally upward electric field. However, the MPB in the Southern Hemisphere is found to actually move inward when the electric field is directed locally upward. The crustal magnetic fields in the Southern Hemisphere have a strong influence on the MPB and cause it to move to higher altitudes over strong crustal magnetic fields. The influence of the crustal magnetic fields on the BS is more ambiguous since there are few crossings over the strongest crustal fields, but there appears to be at least a small trend of a higher BS for stronger crustal fields. An increased solar EUV flux has been found to cause the BS to move outward and the MPB to move inward., The Antarctic plateau contains the best sites on earth for many forms of astronomy, but none of the existing bases was selected with astronomy as the primary motivation. In this article, we try to systematically compare the merits of potential observatory sites. We include South Pole, Domes A, C, and F, and also Ridge B (running northeast from Dome A), and what we call “Ridge A” (running southwest from Dome A). Our analysis combines satellite data, published results, and atmospheric models, to compare the boundary layer, weather, aurorae, airglow, precipitable water vapor, thermal sky emission, surface temperature, and the free atmosphere, at each site. We find that all Antarctic sites are likely to be compromised for optical work by airglow and aurorae. Of the sites with existing bases, Dome A is easily the best overall; but we find that Ridge A offers an even better site. We also find that Dome F is a remarkably good site. Dome C is less good as a thermal infrared or terahertz site, but would be able to take advantage of a predicted “OH hole” over Antarctica during spring., Supermassive black holes (BHs) obey tight scaling relations between their mass and host galaxy properties such as total stellar mass, velocity dispersion and potential well depth. This has led to the development of self-regulated models for BH growth, in which feedback from the central BH halts its own growth upon reaching a critical threshold. However, models have also been proposed in which feedback plays no role: so long as a fixed fraction of the host gas supply is accreted, relations like those observed can be reproduced. Here, we argue that the scatter in the observed BH-host correlations presents a demanding constraint on any model for these correlations, and that it favours self-regulated models of BH growth. We show that the scatter in the stellar mass fraction within a radius R in observed ellipticals and spheroids increases strongly at small R. At a fixed total stellar mass (or host velocity dispersion), on very small scales near the BH radius of influence, there is an order-of-magnitude scatter in the amount of gas that must have entered and formed stars. In short, the BH appears to `know more' about the global host galaxy potential on large scales than the stars and gas supply on small scales. This is predicted in self-regulated models; however, models where there is no feedback would generically predict order-of-magnitude scatter in the BH-host correlations. Likewise, models in which the BH feedback in the `bright' mode does not regulate the growth of the BH itself, but sets the stellar mass of the galaxy by inducing star formation or blowing out a mass in gas much larger than the galaxy stellar mass, are difficult to reconcile with the scatter on small scales., A detectable level of carbon monoxide is not predicted by thermochemical models of Neptune's upper atmosphere, so its discovery in 1992 was unexpected (Rosenqvist et al. 1992). Its presence suggests that CO is either transported from Neptune's deep interior by convection, or produced in the stratosphere by photosynthesis of hydrocarbons with externally supplied oxygen. Both of these scenarios would have important implications for Neptune's interior and exterior environments, as well as wider implications for the understanding of planetary disk evolution and ice giant formation. We present new measurements of the full line shape of the CO J=2-1 and J=1-0 transitions from the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) that include the first spatially resolved measurements of CO in Neptune's atmosphere. The analysis of two different CO lines allows us to constrain the absolute abundance of CO in the different atmospheric layers despite Neptune's changing temperature-pressure profile. By spatially resolving Neptune in CO, we are able to measure possible latitudinal gradients, which we might expect if CO is being driven upwards from the deep interior by a global circulation. Such a circulation pattern has been suggested by previous mid-IR and radio data., Einstein's general theory of relativity establishes equality between matter-energy density and the curvature of spacetime. As a result, light and matter follow natural paths in the inherent spacetime and may experience bending and trapping in a specific region of space. So far, the interaction of light and matter with curved spacetime has been predominantly studied theoretically and through astronomical observations. Here, we propose to link the newly emerged field of artificial optical materials to that of celestial mechanics, thus opening the way to investigate light phenomena reminiscent of orbital motion, strange attractors and chaos, in a controlled laboratory environment. The optical-mechanical analogy enables direct studies of critical light/matter behaviour around massive celestial bodies and, on the other hand, points towards the design of novel optical cavities and photon traps for application in microscopic devices and lasers systems., The relative abundances of calcium isotopes in the mass range 40-44 were measured in primitive and differentiated meteorites and igneous rocks from Earth and Mars in search of non-mass-dependent variations that could provide clues about early solar system processes. Most bulk samples of planetary materials have calcium isotopic compositions identical with Earth's within the current resolution of about 0.01% in <SUP>40</SUP>Ca/<SUP>44</SUP>Ca. Possible exceptions include carbonaceous chondrites, some ordinary chondrites, and two samples of calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions, which have small excesses of <SUP>40</SUP>Ca. The samples with <SUP>40</SUP>Ca excesses are also known to have <SUP>50</SUP>Ti and <SUP>135</SUP>Ba excesses and <SUP>142</SUP>Nd and <SUP>144</SUP>Sm deficits. Collectively these data from refractory elements suggest that the planetary embryos represented by chondrites preserve isotopic heterogeneity that reflects different nucleosynthetic sources. No late admixture from a single nucleosynthetic source can explain all observations. The results are most compatible with variable proportions of material derived from Type II supernovae. The initial calcium isotope compositions of Earth and Mars are indistinguishable and similar to the <SUP>40</SUP>Ca abundance found in some chondrites and all differentiated meteorites studied. It appears that isotopic heterogeneity in calcium was still present at the completion of disk formation but was homogenized during planetary accretion., Observations suggest that the effective radii of high-redshift massive spheroids are as much as a factor of ~6 smaller than low-redshift galaxies of comparable mass. Given the apparent absence of low-redshift counterparts, this has often been interpreted as indicating that the high-density, compact red galaxies must be `puffed up' by some mechanism. We compare the ensemble of high-redshift observations with large samples of well-observed, low-redshift ellipticals. At the same physical radii, the stellar surface mass densities of low- and high-redshift systems are comparable. Moreover, the abundance of high surface density material at low redshift is comparable to or larger than that observed at z &gt; 1-2, consistent with the continuous buildup of spheroids over this time. The entire population of compact, high-redshift red galaxies may be the progenitors of the high-density cores of present-day ellipticals, with no need for a decrease in stellar density from z = 2 to 0. The primary difference between low- and high-redshift systems is thus the observed low-density material at large radii in low-redshift spheroids (rather than the high-density material in high-redshift spheroids). Such low-density material may either (1) assemble at z &lt; 2 or (2) be present, but not yet detected, at z &gt; 2. Mock observations of low-redshift massive systems suggest that the amount of low-density material at high redshifts is indeed significantly less than that at z = 0. However, deeper observations will be important in constraining the exact amount (or lack thereof) and distribution of this material, and how it builds up with redshift. We show that, without deep observations, the full extent of such material even at low redshifts can be difficult to determine, in particular if the mass profile is not exactly a single Sersic profile. We discuss the implications of our results for physical models of galaxy evolution., At low Eddington ratios , two effects make it more difficult to detect certain active galactic nuclei (AGN) given a particular set of selection methods. First, even allowing for fixed accretion physics, at low AGN become less luminous relative to their hosts, diluting their emission; the magnitude of the dilution depends on host properties and, therefore, on luminosity and redshift. Secondly, low- systems are expected and observed to transition to a radiatively inefficient state, which changes the spectral energy distribution (SED) shape and dramatically decreases the luminosity at optical through infrared (IR) wavelengths. The effects of dilution are unavoidable, while the precise changes in accretion physics at low are somewhat uncertain, but potentially very important for our understanding of AGN. These effects will have different implications for samples with different selection criteria, and generically lead to differences in the AGN populations recovered in observed samples, even at fixed bolometric luminosity and after correction for obscuration. Although the true Eddington ratio distribution may depend strongly on mass/luminosity, this will be seen only in surveys robust to dilution and radiative inefficiency, such as X-ray or narrow-line samples; by contrast, selection effects imply that AGN in optical samples will have uniformly high Eddington ratios, with little dependence on luminosity, even at low L<SUB>bol</SUB> where the median `true' &lt;~ 0.01. These same selection effects also imply that different selection criteria pick out systems with different hosts: as a result, the clustering of low-luminosity optical/IR sources will be weaker than that of X-ray sources, and optical/IR Seyferts will reside in more disc-dominated galaxies, while X-ray-selected Seyferts will be preferentially in early-type systems. Taken together, these effects can naturally explain longstanding, apparently contradictory claims in the literature regarding AGN Eddington ratio distributions, host populations and clustering. Finally, we show that if current observed Eddington ratio distributions are correct, a large fraction of low-luminosity AGN currently classified as `obscured' are in fact radiatively diluted and/or radiatively inefficient, not obscured by gas or dust. This is equally true if X-ray hardness is used as a proxy for obscuration, since radiatively inefficient SEDs near are characteristically X-ray hard. These effects can explain most of the claimed luminosity/redshift dependence in the `obscured' AGN population, with the true obscured fraction as low as ~20 per cent., We present O VI λ 1032 emission line measurements along several sight lines towards the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Magellanic Interface region, obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer. The LMC targets include supernova remnants, superbubbles and diffuse interstellar regions. The observed O VI surface brightnesses form a near-continuous distribution spanning two-and-a-half orders of magnitude, with the diffuse gas at the faint end, and the strongly interacting supernova remnants at the bright end. The O VI emission detected from the Magellanic Interface region is evidence that the H I bearing gas is interacting with its surroundings. This, in turn, suggests that hot gas is present in the vicinity of the Magellanic Bridge, about 40 kpc away from the Galaxy., Fomalhaut b is the nearest (7.7 pc) and possibly the lowest mass (&lt;3 MJ) of all the exoplanets directly imaged to date. It is significant because it resides interior to the large dust belt surrounding Fomalhaut, permitting a direct study of planet-belt dynamics around a main sequence star. Its unusual optical brightness may be due to non-thermal processes, such as reflection from a proto-galilean, circumplanetary dust disk. Here we review the path that led to the discovery of Fomalhaut b and discuss future prospects., We propose spatially-resolved R 50 000 PHOENIX observations of Glass I, a member of the class of Infrared Companions (IRCs) to T Tauri stars. The nature of these objects remains elusive, as they apparently defy the paradigm of coevality in young multiple systems. The main goals are (1) to search for the potentially highly-veiled photospheric absorption lines with unprecedented spectral resolution in order to derive the intrinsic stellar nature (spectral type, extinction, continuum excess) of one of these intriguing young objects, (2) to derive the accretion properties (accretion rate, kinematics of brackett gamma line), and (3) characterize the inner circumstellar environment through the search for molecular absorption/emission like HCN and/or non-stellar ^12CO features, as recently achieved for the prototype IRC, namely T Tau Sa (Duchene et al. 2005). These observations will allow us to better constrain the nature and geometry of the obscuring material towards IRCs and to probe the organic chemistry, gas temperatures, and gas kinematics in the planet-forming zones close to a young star., The gas-phase chemistry of water in protoplanetary disks is analyzed with a model based on X-ray heating and ionization of the disk atmosphere. Several uncertain processes appear to play critical roles in generating the column densities of warm water that are detected from disks at infrared wavelengths. The dominant factors are the reactions that form molecular hydrogen, including formation on warm grains, and the ionization and heating of the atmosphere. All of these can work together to produce a region of high water abundances in the molecular transition layer of the inner disk atmosphere, where atoms are transformed into molecules, the temperature drops from thousands to hundreds of Kelvins, and the ionization begins to be dominated by the heavy elements. Grain formation of molecular hydrogen and mechanical heating of the atmosphere can play important roles in this region and directly affect the amount of warm water in protoplanetary disk atmospheres. Thus, it may be possible to account for the existing measurements of water emission from T Tauri disks without invoking transport of water from cooler to warmer regions. The hydroxyl radical OH is underabundant in this model of disk atmospheres and requires consideration of additional production and excitation processes., Observations of redshift-space distortions in spectroscopic galaxy surveys offer an attractive method for observing the build-up of cosmological structure, which depends both on the expansion rate of the Universe and our theory of gravity. In this paper, we present a formalism for forecasting the constraints on the growth of structure which would arise in an idealized survey. This Fisher matrix based formalism can be used to study the power and aid in the design of future surveys., We report on 0.3-10 keV X-ray observations by the Chandra X-ray Observatory of the fields of 22 sources that were discovered as hard X-ray (20-100 keV) sources by the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Satellite (""IGR"" sources). The observations were made during Chandra's 9th observing cycle, and their purpose is to localize the sources and to measure their soft X-ray spectra in order to determine the nature of the sources. We find very likely Chandra counterparts for 18 of the 22 sources. We discuss the implications for each source, considering previous results and new optical or infrared identifications, and we identify or suggest identifications for the nature of 16 of the sources. Two of the sources, IGR J14003-6326 and IGR J17448-3232, are extended on arcminute scales. We identify the former as a pulsar wind nebula with a surrounding supernova remnant (SNR) and the latter as an SNR. In the group of 242 IGR sources, there is only one other source that has previously been identified as an SNR. Seven of the sources are definite or candidate high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs). We confirm a previous identification of IGR J14331-6112 as an HMXB, and based on combinations of hard X-ray spectra, inferred distances and X-ray luminosities, and/or column density variations, we suggest that IGR J17404-3655, IGR J16287-5021, IGR J17354-3255, IGR J17507-2647, IGR J17586-2129, and IGR J13186-6257 are candidate HMXBs. Our results indicate or confirm that IGR J19267+1325, IGR J18173-2509, and IGR J18308-1232 are cataclysmic variables (CVs), and we suggest that IGR J15529-5029 may also be a CV. We confirm that IGR J14471-6414 is an active galactic nucleus (AGN), and we also suggest that IGR J19443+2117 and IGR J18485-0047 may be AGNs. Finally, we found Chandra counterparts for IGR J11098-6457 and IGR J18134-1636, but more information is required to determine the nature of these two sources., Cosmologically long-lived, composite states arise as natural dark matter candidates in theories with a strongly interacting hidden sector at a scale of 10-100 TeV. Light axionlike states, with masses in the 1 MeV-10 GeV range, are also generic, and can decay via Higgs couplings to light standard model particles. Such a scenario is well motivated in the context of very low-energy supersymmetry breaking, where ubiquitous cosmological problems associated with the gravitino are avoided. We investigate the astrophysical and collider signatures of this scenario, assuming that dark matter decays into the axionlike states via dimension six operators, and we present an illustrative model exhibiting these features. We conclude that the recent data from PAMELA, FERMI, and H.E.S.S. points to this setup as a compelling paradigm for dark matter. This has important implications for future diffuse gamma ray measurements and collider searches., Microchannel plate detectors with cross strip anodes have demonstrated excellent performance characteristics, their resolution has reached the 6-10 μm scale (the typical size of pores in a microchannel plate) and the imaging nonlinearities are small. Working at much lower gain (~5 x 10<SUP>5</SUP>) than many other devices, the cross strip readout has many other advantages, low complexity, robustness, compactness and the ability to fit many formats. We have now implemented cross strip detectors in several formats including, 40mm open face (UV/particle) and 18mm sealed tube (optical). These have been combined with a new signal processing technique which allows for high counting rates exceeding 5 MHz with high spatial resolution (&lt;20 μm FWHM). The imaging performance is dependent on optimization of firmware algorithms that are used to calculate event position centroids. With new FPGA designs and implementation considerable flexibility is gained, allowing the fidelity of the imaging readout to be progressively tuned for maximal performance., Electromagnetic fluctuations in the inertial range of solar wind MHD turbulence and beyond (up to frequencies of 10Hz) have been studied for the first time using both magnetic field and electric field measurements on Cluster [Bale et al., 2005]. It has been shown that at frequencies above the spectral breakpoint at 0.4Hz, in the so-called dissipation range, the wave modes become dispersive and are consistent with Kinetic Alfven Waves (KAW). This interpretation is based on the simple assumption that the measured frequency spectrum is actually a Doppler shifted wave number spectrum, commonly used in the solar wind and known as Taylor's hypothesis. While Taylor's hypothesis is valid in the inertial range of solar wind turbulence, it may break down in the dissipation range where temporal fluctuations can become important. <P />We analyze here the effect of Doppler shift on KAW as well as compressional proton whistler waves, in a low-beta plasma. We determine, both analytically and numerically, the dispersive properties of the KAW and the whistler wave modes and estimate the electric to magnetic field ratio in the plasma and the spacecraft frame. We then revisit the Cluster electric field and magnetic field data in the solar wind, considering only low-beta, ambient solar wind intervals. We compare the analytical/numerical estimates with the data directly in the spacecraft frame. We show that this technique provides an efficient diagnostics for wave-mode identification in the dissipation/dispersion range of solar wind turbulence., Recently, a number of analytic prescriptions for computing the nonlinear matter power spectrum have appeared in the literature. These typically involve resummation or closure prescriptions which do not have a rigorous error control, thus they must be compared with numerical simulations to assess their range of validity. We present a direct side-by-side comparison of several of these analytic approaches, using a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations as a reference, and discuss some general trends. All of the analytic results correctly predict the behavior of the power spectrum at the onset of nonlinearity, and improve upon a pure linear theory description at very large scales. All of these theories fail at sufficiently small scales. At low redshift the dynamic range in scale where perturbation theory is both relevant and reliable can be quite small. We also compute for the first time the two-loop contribution to standard perturbation theory for cold dark matter models, finding improved agreement with simulations at large redshift. At low redshifts however the two-loop term is larger than the one-loop term on quasilinear scales, indicating a breakdown of the perturbation expansion. Finally, we comment on possible implications of our results for future studies. A software package implementing the methods presented here is available at http://mwhite.berkeley.edu/Copter., The Focusing Optics x-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI) is a sounding rocket payload funded under the NASA Low Cost Access to Space program to test hard x-ray focusing optics and position-sensitive solid state detectors for solar observations. Today's leading solar hard x-ray instrument, the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) provides excellent spatial (2 arcseconds) and spectral (1 keV) resolution. Yet, due to its use of indirect imaging, the derived images have a low dynamic range (&lt;30) and sensitivity. These limitations make it difficult to study faint x-ray sources in the solar corona which are crucial for understanding the solar flare acceleration process. Grazing-incidence x-ray focusing optics combined with position-sensitive solid state detectors can overcome both of these limitations enabling the next breakthrough in understanding particle acceleration in solar flares. The FOXSI project is led by the Space Science Laboratory at the University of California. The NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, with experience from the HERO balloon project, is responsible for the grazing-incidence optics, while the Astro H team (JAXA/ISAS) will provide double-sided silicon strip detectors. FOXSI will be a pathfinder for the next generation of solar hard x-ray spectroscopic imagers. Such observatories will be able to image the non-thermal electrons within the solar flare acceleration region, trace their paths through the corona, and provide essential quantitative measurements such as energy spectra, density, and energy content in accelerated electrons., We briefly describe the local superbubbles and supershells that lie near the Sun. These include, of course, the famous ones-the Orion/Eridanus superbubble and the North Polar Spur shell. It also includes less famous, less prominent, older, but equally important ones: we stress the elliptical Lindblad Ring, which surrounds the Sun and has a maximum diameter 364 pc, and GSH 238+00+09, which is a huge old shell. Both appear to be responsible for shock-induced star formation; GSR 238+0+09, in particular, may be responsible for the Orion and Gum associations. <P />We then turn to the Local Bubble and describe some of its little-known and remarkable occupants: interstellar scattering centers, which are ionized blobs having sizes of a few Earth diameters, and one of the coldest HI clouds known, which produces prominent X-ray shadow and allows us to estimate the local X-ray production rate within a few dozen parsec from the Sun., We compute the probability distribution for bubble collisions in an inflating false vacuum which decays by bubble nucleation. Our analysis generalizes previous work of Guth, Garriga, and Vilenkin to the case of general cosmological evolution inside the bubble, and takes into account the dynamics of the domain walls that form between the colliding bubbles. We find that incorporating these effects changes the results dramatically: the total expected number of bubble collisions in the past lightcone of a typical observer is N ~ γ V<SUB>f</SUB>/V<SUB>i</SUB> , where γ is the fastest decay rate of the false vacuum, V<SUB>f</SUB> is its vacuum energy, and V<SUB>i</SUB> is the vacuum energy during inflation inside the bubble. This number can be large in realistic models without tuning. In addition, we calculate the angular position and size distribution of the collisions on the cosmic microwave background sky, and demonstrate that the number of bubbles of observable angular size is N<SUB>LS</SUB> ~ (Ω<SUB>k</SUB>)<SUP>1/2</SUP>N, where Ω<SUB>k</SUB> is the curvature contribution to the total density at the time of observation. The distribution is almost exactly isotropic., High signal-to-noise, representative spectra of star-forming galaxies at z ~ 2, obtained via stacking, reveal a high-velocity component underneath the narrow Hα and [N II] emission lines. When modeled as a single Gaussian, this broad component has FWHM gsim 1500 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> when modeled as broad wings on the Hα and [N II] features, it has FWHM gsim 500 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. This feature is preferentially found in the more massive and more rapidly star-forming systems, which also tend to be older and larger galaxies. We interpret this emission as evidence of either powerful starburst-driven galactic winds or active supermassive black holes (SMBHs). If galactic winds are responsible for the broad emission, the observed luminosity and velocity of this gas imply mass outflow rates comparable to the star formation rate. On the other hand, if the broad-line regions of active black holes account for the broad feature, the corresponding black holes masses are estimated to be an order of magnitude lower than those predicted by local scaling relations, suggesting a delayed assembly of SMBHs with respect to their host bulges. <P />Based on observations obtained at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) of the European Southern Observatory, Paranal, Chile in the context of ESO programs 070.A-0229, 070.B-0545, 073.B-9018, 074.A-9011, 075.A-0466, 076.A-0527, 077.A-0576, 078.A-0055, 078.A-0600, 079.A-0341, 080.A-0330, and 080.A-0635., Radio astrometry of nearby, low-mass stars has the potential to be a powerful tool for the discovery and characterization of planetary companions. We present a Very Large Array survey of 172 active M dwarfs at distances of less than 10 pc. Twenty-nine stars were detected with flux densities greater than 100 μJy. We observed seven of these stars with the Very Long Baseline Array at milliarcsecond resolution in three separate epochs. With a detection threshold of 500 μJy in images of sensitivity 1σ ~ 100 μJy, we detected three stars three times (GJ 65B, GJ 896A, GJ 4247), one star twice (GJ 285), and one star once (GJ 803). Two stars were undetected (GJ 412B and GJ 1224). For the four stars detected in multiple epochs, residuals from the optically determined apparent motions have an root-mean-square deviation of ~0.2 milliarcseconds, consistent with statistical noise limits. Combined with previous optical astrometry, these residuals provide acceleration upper limits that allow us to exclude planetary companions more massive than 3-6 M <SUB>Jup</SUB> at a distance of ~1 AU with a 99% confidence level., We present measurements of the angular power spectrum of millimeter wave anisotropies with the APEX-SZ instrument. APEX-SZ has mapped 0.8 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of sky at a frequency of 150 GHz with an angular resolution of 1'. These new measurements significantly improve the constraints on anisotropy power at 150 GHz over the range of angular multipoles 3000 &lt; ell &lt; 10, 000, limiting the total astronomical signal in a flat band power to be less than 105 μK<SUP>2</SUP> at 95% CL. We expect both submillimeter-bright, dusty galaxies and to a lesser extent secondary cosmic microwave background anisotropies from the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) to significantly contribute to the observed power. Subtracting the SZE power spectrum expected for σ<SUB>8</SUB> = 0.8 and masking bright sources, the best-fit value for the remaining power is C <SUB>ell</SUB> = 1.1<SUP>+0.9</SUP> <SUB>-0.8</SUB> × 10<SUP>-5</SUP> μK<SUP>2</SUP> (1.7<SUP>+1.4</SUP> <SUB>-1.3</SUB> Jy<SUP>2</SUP> sr<SUP>-1</SUP>). This agrees well with model predictions for power due to submillimeter-bright, dusty galaxies. Comparing this power to the power detected by BLAST at 600 GHz, we find the frequency dependence of the source fluxes to be S_ν ∝ ν^{2.6^{+0.4}_{-0.2}} if both experiments measure the same population of sources. Simultaneously fitting for the amplitude of the SZE power spectrum and a Poisson-distributed point source population, we place an upper limit on the matter fluctuation amplitude of σ<SUB>8</SUB> &lt; 1.18 at 95% confidence., This proposal aims at using the queue-mode 1.3m telescope at CTIO to gather near-contemporaneous photometric measurements of a sample of objects that will be observed with the Herschel Space Observatory in the upcoming months as part of the Open Time Key Program GASPS. This project is aimed at characterizing the gas content of circumstellar disks around young stars throughout the planet formation phase. In order to model the Herschel data in a coherent manner, it is necessary to determine each star's basic properties (effective temperature, mass, luminosity), which implies obtaining a complete broadband spectral energy distribution to combine with existing longer data (AKARI, Spitzer, Herschel and millimeter single-dish and interferometric fluxes). Here we propose to obtain new simultaneous optical and IR photometric measurements of 16 targets that cannot be observed from Northern observatories. In addition to provide a sound basis for our disk modeling effort, the observations proposed here will also offer new insight on the location, morphology and evolution of the disks' inner rim in conjunction with the currently ongoing AKARI observations., The distribution of a low-density transition temperature (10<SUP>4.5</SUP>-10<SUP>5.5</SUP> K) gas in the interstellar medium conveys the character and evolution of diffuse matter in the Galaxy. This difficult to observe component of the ISM emits mainly in the far-ultraviolet (FUV) (912-1800 A˚) band. We describe spectral maps of FUV emission lines from the highly ionized species CIV and OVI likely to be the dominant cooling mechanisms of transition temperature gas in the ISM. The maps were obtained using an orbital spectrometer, SPEAR, that was launched in 2003 and has observed the FUV sky with a spectral resolution of ~550 and an angular resolution of 10'. <P />We compare distribution of flux in these maps with three basic models of the distribution of transition temperature gas. We find that the median distribution of CIV and OVI emission is consistent with the spatial distribution and line ratios expected from a McKee-Ostriker (MO) type model of evaporative interfaces. However, the intensities are a factor of three higher than would be expected at the MO preferred parameters. Some high intensity regions are clearly associated with supernova remnants and superbubble structures. Others may indicate regions where gas is cooling through the transition temperature., The STEREO/WAVES instrument is designed to measure interplanetary radio emission and in situ plasma waves in the solar wind. The instrument uses three orthogonal monopole electric antennas as its sensor system in both a pseudodipole and monopole mode. At high radio frequencies, the capacitance of the antennas determines the system gain. Here we estimate the stray capacitance in the antenna system by comparing the measured voltage spectrum with a model of the galactic continuum spectrum, which is the instrument background at high frequencies. Together with the antenna free-space capacitance, these measurements provide an absolute calibration of the STEREO/WAVES experiment at radio frequencies, a prerequisite for quantitative studies of solar and astrophysical radio emission., Recently two groups used first-principles computer simulations to model Jupiter's interior. While both studies relied on the same simulation technique, density functional molecular dynamics, the groups derived very different conclusions. In particular estimates for the size of Jupiter's core and the metallicity of its hydrogen-helium mantle differed substantially. In this paper, we discuss the differences of the approaches and give an explanation for the differing conclusions., Transformation of discs into spheroids via mergers is a well-accepted element of galaxy formation models. However, recent simulations have shown that the bulge formation is suppressed in increasingly gas-rich mergers. We investigate the global implications of these results in a cosmological framework, using independent approaches: empirical halo-occupation models (where galaxies are populated in haloes according to observations) and semi-analytic models. In both, ignoring the effects of gas in mergers leads to the overproduction of spheroids: low- and intermediate-mass galaxies are predicted to be bulge-dominated (B/T ~ 0.5 at &lt;10<SUP>10</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB>, with almost no `bulgeless' systems), even if they have avoided major mergers. Including the different physical behaviour of gas in mergers immediately leads to a dramatic change: bulge formation is suppressed in low-mass galaxies, observed to be gas-rich (giving B/T ~ 0.1 at &lt;10<SUP>10</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB>, with a number of bulgeless galaxies in good agreement with observations). Simulations and analytic models which neglect the similarity-breaking behaviour of gas have difficulty reproducing the strong observed morphology-mass relation. However, the observed dependence of gas fractions on mass, combined with suppression of bulge formation in gas-rich mergers, naturally leads to the observed trends. Discrepancies between observations and models that ignore the role of gas increase with redshift; in models that treat gas properly, galaxies are predicted to be less bulge-dominated at high redshifts, in agreement with the observations. We discuss implications for the global bulge mass density and future observational tests., We provide estimates of volcanism versus time for planets with Earth-like composition and masses 0.25-25 M <SUB>⊕</SUB>, as a step toward predicting atmospheric mass on extrasolar rocky planets. Volcanism requires melting of the silicate mantle. We use a thermal evolution model, calibrated against Earth, in combination with standard melting models, to explore the dependence of convection-driven decompression mantle melting on planet mass. We show that (1) volcanism is likely to proceed on massive planets with plate tectonics over the main-sequence lifetime of the parent star; (2) crustal thickness (and melting rate normalized to planet mass) is weakly dependent on planet mass; (3) stagnant lid planets live fast (they have higher rates of melting than their plate tectonic counterparts early in their thermal evolution), but die young (melting shuts down after a few Gyr); (4) plate tectonics may not operate on high-mass planets because of the production of buoyant crust which is difficult to subduct; and (5) melting is necessary but insufficient for efficient volcanic degassing—volatiles partition into the earliest, deepest melts, which may be denser than the residue and sink to the base of the mantle on young, massive planets. Magma must also crystallize at or near the surface, and the pressure of overlying volatiles must be fairly low, if volatiles are to reach the surface. If volcanism is detected in the 10 Gyr-old τ Ceti system, and tidal forcing can be shown to be weak, this would be evidence for plate tectonics., Galaxy surveys are one of the most powerful means to extract cosmological information and for a given volume the attainable precision is determined by the galaxy shot noise σ<SUB>n</SUB><SUP>2</SUP> relative to the power spectrum P. It is generally assumed that shot noise is white and given by the inverse of the number density n¯. In this Letter we argue one may considerably improve upon this due to mass and momentum conservation. We explore this idea with N-body simulations by weighting central halo galaxies by halo mass and find that the resulting shot noise can be reduced dramatically relative to expectations, with a 10-30 suppression at n¯=4×10<SUP>-3</SUP>(h/Mpc)<SUP>3</SUP>. These results open up new opportunities to extract cosmological information in galaxy surveys and may have important consequences for the planning of future redshift surveys., NICMOS has played a key role in probing the deep near infrared regime for a decade. It has been the only instrument available to observe faint objects in the near infrared that are not observable from the ground. However, the calibration of NICMOS has turned out to be difficult in the low-count-rate regime. The NICMOS calibration team has extrapolated a power-law to describe the apparent non-linearity in the NICMOS detectors from measurements at 50-5000 ADU/s to flux counts around 0.1-1 ADU/s. Precise measurements of faint objects {such as SNe Ia at high redshift} require us to reduce the uncertainties from this extrapolation. Here we propose to determine the absolute zeropoint for faint objects by cross-calibrating the WFC3 and NICMOS detectors in observations of early type galaxies at redshifts z&gt;1., In order to characterize the periodic intrapixel sensitivity variation {IPSV} of the WFC3 IR array, we will analyze full-frame IR observations of a star field {in the Omega Centauri globular cluster} in three bandpasses {F110W, F160W, and F098M} dithered on an NxN grid. The measurements will be used to quantify systematic trends in aperture photometry of stars with pixel phase, defined as {x mod 1, y mod 1}, where {x,y} is the center of the stellar image at subpixel precision. Grid sizes of N=2 and N=3 are justifed in Additional Comments of Proposal Description., We propose a modest {2 WFC3 orbits} HST program to ascertain the origin of the mysterious gamma-ray burst GRB 070125. With a duration of 60 s and a high local {i.e. parsec scale} circum-burst density, GRB 070125 resembles a canonical {i.e. massive-star progenitor} long-duration event. However, we have strong evidence that GRB 070125 exploded in the halo of its host galaxy, far away from the bulk of massive star formation. The UV detection of a compact, star-forming cluster would confirm our original hypothesis that GRB 070125 exploded in a tidal tail formed by galaxy interactions {analogous to the Tadpole and Antenna galaxies} at z = 1.54. Alternatively, the absence of ongoing star formation and the presence of an old stellar population would require a novel explosion process unassociated with massive stars. While the former would open a new path to study star formation and galaxy interactions at high redshift, the latter would require a re-thinking of one of the fundamental tenets of GRB astronomy: the 1:1 mapping between duration and progenitor system., Circumstellar debris disks provide the principle window for investigating planet formation and evolution on timescales of 10-100 Myr. Unlike their younger counterparts, debris disks no longer contain primordial material. The dust observed in these objects is instead produced by collisional erosion of larger parent bodies in the developing planetary system. Currently, only five confirmed debris disks have detected circumstellar gas, studied primarily through UV absorption spectroscopy. The exact production mechanisms for this replenished gas are presently poorly constrained. However, the few objects studied so far have revealed a wide range of intruiging properties, including a stable Keplerian gas disk maintained by its high carbon abundance {Beta Pic}, and a rapidly expelled population of gas produced in collisions between unstable planetesimals {Sigma Her}. To add to this important set of observations, we propose to obtain NUV STIS spectroscopy of the debris disk host, HD 61005, a nearly edge-on debris disk notable for its swept asymmetric morphology. These observations allow the likely detection of circumstellar gas, making HD 61005 the first solar-type debris disk host with gas detected in this way. Thus, the proposed observations provide the unique opportunity to study gas in a debris disk analogous to our early solar system. In addition to potentially detecting circumstellar gas associated with this system, HD 61005 offers the possibility of tracing interstellar bow-shocked gas. HD 61005 is a unique debris disk in terms of its significant interaction with the interstellar medium. The proposed observations will, therefore, be the first to directly probe the interaction between a debris disk and its surrounding interstellar material. STIS is ideally suited for this experiment, providing sensitive NUV spectra with the required balance between spectral resolution and wavelength coverage., Fringing has been observed in flat fields of 12 narrowband filters {4 full-frame and 3 quad spectral elements} longer than 600 nm, with peak-to-peak fringe amplitude variations ranging from 0.5% to 14.2% {WFC3 ISR 2010-04}. Two filters {F953N and F656N} will be tested in program 11922, supporting 88 Cycle 17 GO exposures in these filters. Here we propose to observe globular cluster Omega Centauri {NGC 5139} in the other 10 filters affected by fringing, supporting 319 Cycle 17 GO exposures in these filters. By measuring the relative changes in brightness of stars at different positions on the detector, we will determine the local variations induced by the fringing pattern.The data will serve two purposes: characterize the effect of fringing on photometry of on-orbit data, and verify models used to correct for fringing effects. The models rely on Thermal Vacuum Test 3 {TV3} data between 845-990 nm and NASA/GSFC Detector Characterization Laboratory {DCL} test data from 700-1060 nm. Only the F953N filter in program 11922 overlaps with the test data wavelength range, making it difficult to compare the efficacy of fringe models. This program will expand the on-orbit fringing data so that we can compare models at 6 new wavelengths within the ground test data wavelength range, as well as 4 new wavelengths not covered by the ground test data. Flight data in these 4 filters can be corrected by extrapolating the model beyond the wavelength range of the test data used to create the model., We study the observables of 158 relatively normal Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) by dividing them into two groups in terms of the expansion velocity inferred from the absorption minimum of the Si II λ6355 line in their spectra near B-band maximum brightness. One group (""Normal"") consists of normal SNe Ia populating a narrow strip in the Si II velocity distribution, with an average expansion velocity langvrang = 10, 600 ± 400 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> near B maximum; the other group (""HV"") consists of objects with higher velocities, v gsim 11, 800 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Compared with the Normal group, the HV one shows a narrower distribution in both the peak luminosity and the luminosity decline rate Δm <SUB>15</SUB>. In particular, their B-V colors at maximum brightness are found to be on average redder by ~ 0.1 mag, suggesting that they either are associated with dusty environments or have intrinsically red B-V colors. The HV SNe Ia are also found to prefer a lower extinction ratio R<SUB>V</SUB> ≈ 1.6 (versus ~ 2.4 for the Normal ones). Applying such an absorption-correction dichotomy to SNe Ia of these two groups remarkably reduces the dispersion in their peak luminosity from 0.178 mag to only 0.125 mag., Following a coronal mass ejection (CME) which started on 2002 November 26, RHESSI observed for 12 hr an X-ray source above the solar limb, at altitudes between 0.1 and 0.3 R<SUB>S</SUB> above the photosphere. The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite baseline was remarkably high throughout this event. The X-ray source's temperature peaked around 10-11 MK, and its emission measure increased throughout this time interval. Higher up, at 0.7 R<SUB>S</SUB> , hot (initially &gt;8 MK) plasma has been observed by Ultraviolet Coronograph Spectrometer on Solar and Heliospheric Observatory for 2.3 days. This hot plasma was interpreted as the signature of a current sheet (CS) trailing the CME. The thermal energy content of the X-ray source is more than an order of magnitude larger than in the CS. Hence, it could be the source of the hot plasma in the CS, although CS heating by magnetic reconnection within it cannot be discounted. To better characterize the X-ray spectrum, we have used novel techniques (back-projection-based and visibility-based) for long-integration (several hours) imaging spectroscopy. There is no observed nonthermal hard X-ray bremsstrahlung emission, leading to the conclusion that there is either very little particle acceleration occurring in the vicinity of this postflare X-ray source, or that either the photon spectral index would have had to be uncharacteristically (in flare parlance) high (γ gsim 8) and/or the low-energy cutoff very low (E<SUB>c</SUB> lsim 6 keV)., Using a linear stability analysis and two- and three-dimensional nonlinear simulations, we study the physics of buoyancy instabilities in a combined thermal and relativistic (cosmic ray) plasma, motivated by the application to clusters of galaxies. We argue that the cosmic-ray diffusion time is likely to be long compared to the buoyancy time on large length scales, so that cosmic rays are effectively adiabatic. If the cosmic-ray pressure p <SUB>cr</SUB> is gsim25% of the thermal pressure, and the cosmic-ray ""entropy"" p <SUB>cr</SUB>/ρ<SUP>4/3</SUP> (where ρ is the thermal-plasma density) decreases outward, cosmic rays drive an adiabatic convective instability analogous to Schwarzschild convection in stars. Global simulations of galaxy cluster cores show that this instability saturates by reducing the cosmic-ray entropy gradient and driving efficient convection and turbulent mixing. At larger radii in cluster cores where cosmic-ray pressure is negligible, the thermal plasma is unstable to the heat-flux-driven buoyancy instability (HBI), a convective instability generated by anisotropic thermal conduction and a background conductive heat flux. The HBI saturates by rearranging the magnetic field lines to become largely perpendicular to the local gravitational field; the resulting turbulence also primarily mixes plasma in the perpendicular plane. Cosmic-ray-driven convection and the HBI may contribute to redistributing metals produced by Type Ia supernovae in clusters. Our calculations demonstrate that adiabatic simulations of galaxy clusters can artificially suppress the mixing of thermal plasma. When anisotropic thermal conduction is included, the buoyant response of the thermal plasma is not governed by the stable entropy gradient, and mixing (driven by mergers, cosmic ray buoyancy, etc.) is more effective. Such mixing may contribute to cosmic rays being distributed throughout the cluster volume., We propose observations of Jupiter with global coverage at highresolution to quantify changes in its atmosphere during andfollowing the global upheaval. Only HST has the capability toobtain images with enough spatial resolution and contrast toextract velocity fields {we will use our newly developedtechnique to accomplish this}, and with WFC3 we can image Jupiterin its entirety in a single exposure. We are in particularinterested in the Red Oval BA: Will the Oval be long-lived,remain red, or turn white again, disappear? Both the merger ofits precursors, and change in color has never before beenwitnessed. The Great Red Spot: This storm system appears todecrease in size and has become rounder, both as derived from itsassociated cloud deck, but also from its potential vorticity, amore dynamically-relevant quantity. How will the GRS evolve? Willit swallow the new vortices detected in amateur images at thissame latitude band? How will this effect the potential vorticity?In addition, we hope to understand Disturbances and stagnationpoints, both of which were detected during the present globalupheaval: are these cyclonic regions, can they spawn anticyclones{as suggested by amateur images}?, We report first in situ multispacecraft observations of nonlinear steepening of compressional pulses in the solar wind upstream of Earth’s bow shock. The magnetic field of a compressional pulse formed at the upstream edge of density holes is shown to suddenly break and steepen into a shocklike structure. During the early phase of development thermalization of ions is insignificant. Substantial thermalization of ions occurs as gyrating ions are observed at the steepened edge. These observations indicate that the mechanisms causing the dissipation of magnetic fields (currents) and ions are different in the early phase of shock development., Compared with macroscopic surfaces, the structure of water around nanoparticles is difficult to probe directly. We used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the effects of particle size and morphology on the time-averaged structure and the dynamics of water molecules around two sizes of hematite (α-Fe <SUB>2</SUB>O <SUB>3</SUB>) nanoparticles. Interrogation of the simulations via atomic density maps, radial distribution functions and bound water residence times provide insight into the relationships between particle size and morphology and the behavior of interfacial water. Both 1.6 and 2.7 nm particles are predicted to cause the formation of ordered water regions close to the nanoparticle surface, but the extent of localization and ordering, the connectivity between regions of bound water, and the rates of molecular exchange between inner and outer regions are all affected by particle size and morphology. These findings are anticipated to be relevant to understanding the rates of interfacial processes involving water exchange and the transport of aqueous ions to surface sites., We examine the class of barotropic fluid models of dark energy, in which the pressure is an explicit function of the density, p=f(ρ). Through general physical considerations we constrain the asymptotic past and future behaviors and show that this class is equivalent to the sum of a cosmological constant and a decelerating perfect fluid, or “aether,” with w<SUB>AE</SUB>≥0. Barotropic models give substantially disjoint predictions from quintessence, except in the limit of ΛCDM. They are also interesting in that they simultaneously can ameliorate the coincidence problem and yet “predict” a value of w≈-1., We present a filtering technique that can be applied to individual baselines of wide-bandwidth, wide-field interferometric data to geometrically select regions on the celestial sphere that contain primary calibration sources. The technique relies on the Fourier transformation of wide-band frequency spectra from a given baseline to obtain one-dimensional ""delay images,"" and then the transformation of a time-series of delay images to obtain two-dimensional ""delay/delay-rate images."" Source selection is possible in these images given appropriate combinations of baseline, bandwidth, integration time, and source location. Strong and persistent radio frequency interference (RFI) limits the effectiveness of this source selection owing to the removal of data by RFI excision algorithms. A one-dimensional, complex CLEAN algorithm has been developed to compensate for RFI-excision effects. This approach allows CLEANed, source-isolated data to be used to isolate bandpass and primary beam gain functions. These techniques are applied to data from the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization as a demonstration of their value in calibrating a new generation of low-frequency radio interferometers with wide relative bandwidths and large fields of view., A white dwarf (WD) approaching the Chandrasekhar mass may in several circumstances undergo accretion-induced collapse (AIC) to a neutron star (NS) before a thermonuclear explosion ensues. It has generally been assumed that such an AIC does not produce a detectable supernova (SN). If, however, the progenitor WD is rapidly rotating (as may be expected due to its prior accretion), a centrifugally supported disc forms around the NS upon collapse. We calculate the subsequent evolution of this accretion disc and its nuclear composition using time-dependent height-integrated simulations with initial conditions taken from the AIC calculations of Dessart and collaborators. Soon after its formation, the disc is cooled by neutrinos and its composition is driven neutron rich (electron fraction Y<SUB>e</SUB> ~ 0.1) by electron captures. However, as the disc viscously spreads, it is irradiated by neutrinos from the central proto-NS, which dramatically alters its neutron-to-proton ratio. We find that electron neutrino captures increase Y<SUB>e</SUB> to ~0.5 by the time that weak interactions in the disc freeze out. Because the disc becomes radiatively inefficient and begins forming α-particles soon after freeze out, powerful winds blow away most of the disc's remaining mass. These Y<SUB>e</SUB> ~ 0.5 outflows synthesize up to a few times 10<SUP>-2</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB> in <SUP>56</SUP>Ni. As a result, AIC may be accompanied by a radioactively powered SN-like transient that peaks on a time-scale of ~1 d. Since few intermediate mass elements are likely synthesized, these nickel-rich explosions should be spectroscopically distinct from other SNe. The time-scale, velocity and composition of the AIC transient can be modified if the disc wind sweeps up a ~0.1M<SUB>solar</SUB> remnant disc created by a WD-WD merger; such an `enshrouded' AIC may account for sub-luminous, sub-Chandrasekhar Type I SNe. Optical transient surveys such as the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System and the Palomar Transient Factory should detect a few AIC transients per year if their true rate is ~10<SUP>-2</SUP> of the type Ia rate, and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope should detect several hundred per year. High cadence observations (&lt;~1 d) are optimal for the detection and followup of AIC., We present a model for the dispersal of protoplanetary disks by winds from either the central star or the inner disk. These winds obliquely strike the flaring disk surface and strip away disk material by entraining it in an outward radial-moving flow at the wind-disk interface, which lies several disk scale heights above the midplane. The disk dispersal time depends on the entrainment velocity, v<SUB>d</SUB> = epsilonc<SUB>s</SUB> , at which disk material flows into this turbulent shear layer interface, where epsilon is a scale factor and c<SUB>s</SUB> is the local sound speed in the disk surface just below the entrainment layer. If epsilon ~ 0.1, a likely upper limit, the dispersal time at 1 AU is ~6 Myr for a disk with a surface density of 10<SUP>3</SUP> g cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, a solar mass central star, and a wind with an outflow rate \dot{M}_{w}=10^{-8}{M}_{⊙} yr^{-1} and terminal velocity v<SUB>w</SUB> = 200kms<SUP>-1</SUP>. When compared with photoevaporation and viscous evolution, wind stripping can be a dominant mechanism only for the combination of low accretion rates (lsim10<SUP>-8</SUP> M <SUB>sun</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) and wind outflow rates approaching these accretion rates. This case is unusual since generally outflow rates are lsim0.1 of accretion rates., Iron biominerals can form in neutral pH microaerophilic environments where microbes both catalyze iron oxidation and create polymers that localize mineral precipitation. In order to classify the microbial polymers that influence FeOOH mineralogy, we studied the organic and mineral components of biominerals using scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM), micro X-ray fluorescence (μXRF) microscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). We focused on iron microbial mat samples from a creek and abandoned mine; these samples are dominated by iron oxyhydroxide-coated structures with sheath, stalk, and filament morphologies. In addition, we characterized the mineralized products of an iron-oxidizing, stalk-forming bacterial culture isolated from the mine. In both natural and cultured samples, microbial polymers were found to be acidic polysaccharides with carboxyl functional groups, strongly spatially correlated with iron oxyhydroxide distribution patterns. Organic fibrils collect FeOOH and control its recrystallization, in some cases resulting in oriented crystals with high aspect ratios. The impact of polymers is particularly pronounced as the materials age. Synthesis experiments designed to mimic the biomineralization processes show that the polysaccharide carboxyl groups bind dissolved iron strongly but release it as mineralization proceeds. Our results suggest that carboxyl groups of acidic polysaccharides are produced by different microorganisms to create a wide range of iron oxyhydroxide biomineral structures. The intimate and potentially long-term association controls the crystal growth, phase, and reactivity of iron oxyhydroxide nanoparticles in natural systems., We use ideal axisymmetric relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations to calculate the spin-down of a newly formed millisecond, B ~ 10<SUP>15</SUP>G, magnetar and its interaction with the surrounding stellar envelope during a core-collapse supernova (SN) explosion. The mass, angular momentum and rotational energy lost by the neutron star are determined self-consistently given the thermal properties of the cooling neutron star's atmosphere and the wind's interaction with the surrounding star. The magnetar drives a relativistic magnetized wind into a cavity created by the outgoing SN shock. For high spin-down powers (~10<SUP>51</SUP>-10<SUP>52</SUP>ergs<SUP>-1</SUP>), the magnetar wind is superfast at almost all latitudes, while for lower spin-down powers (~10<SUP>50</SUP>ergs<SUP>-1</SUP>), the wind is subfast but still super-Alfvénic. In all cases, the rates at which the neutron star loses mass, angular momentum and energy are very similar to the corresponding free wind values (&lt;~30 per cent differences), in spite of the causal contact between the neutron star and the stellar envelope. In addition, in all cases that we consider, the magnetar drives a collimated (~5-10°) relativistic jet out along the rotation axis of the star. Nearly all of the spin-down power of the neutron star escapes via this polar jet, rather than being transferred to the more spherical SN explosion. The properties of this relativistic jet and its expected late-time evolution in the magnetar model are broadly consistent with observations of long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and their associated broad-lined Type Ic SN., We present X-ray properties of optically selected intermediate-mass (~10<SUP>5</SUP>-10<SUP>6</SUP> M <SUB>sun</SUB>) black holes (BHs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), using data from the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. Our observations are a continuation of a pilot study by Greene &amp; Ho. Of the eight objects observed, five are detected with X-ray luminosities in the range L <SUB>0.5-2 keV </SUB> = 10<SUP>41</SUP>-10<SUP>43</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, consistent with the previously observed sample. Objects with enough counts to extract a spectrum are well fit by an absorbed power law. We continue to find a range of soft photon indices 1 &lt; Γ<SUB>s</SUB> &lt; 2.7, where N(E) ∝ E^{-Γ_s}, consistent with previous AGN studies, but generally flatter than other narrow-line Seyfert 1 active nuclei (NLS1s). The soft photon index correlates strongly with X-ray luminosity and Eddington ratio, but does not depend on BH mass. There is no justification for the inclusion of any additional components, such as a soft excess, although this may be a function of the relative inefficiency of detecting counts above 2 keV in these relatively shallow observations. As a whole, the X-ray-to-optical spectral slope α<SUB>ox</SUB> is flatter than in more massive systems, even other NLS1s. Only X-ray-selected NLS1s with very high Eddington ratios share a similar α<SUB>ox</SUB>. This is suggestive of a physical change in the accretion structure at low masses and at very high accretion rates, possibly due to the onset of slim disks. Although the detailed physical explanation for the X-ray loudness of these intermediate-mass BHs is not certain, it is very striking that targets selected on the basis of optical properties should be so distinctly offset in their broader spectral energy distributions., The diameter of Betelgeuse (α Orionis) has been measured at a wavelength of 11.15 μm using the Infrared Spatial Interferometer over the past 15 years. During this 1993-2009 time period the star's size has decreased systematically by 15%., The principles and appliciations of anion slow electron velocity-map imaging (SEVI) are discussed. SEVI is a variant of photoelectron (PE) imaging in which mass-selected anions are photodetached at a set of wavelengths using a tunable laser source. The resulting photoelectrons are collected via velocity-map imaging (VMI) using relatively low extraction voltages, with the goal of selectively detecting slow electrons with high efficiency and enlarging their image on the detector. This technique offers photoelectron energy resolution of a few cm^{-1}, comparable to that of anion zero electron kinetic energy (ZEKE) spectroscopy, while retaining much of the versatility of conventional PE spectroscopy. The capability of SEVI is demonstrated with the study of the vibronic structure of various heteroatom-doped carbon species (C_nH, C_nO, C_nS and C_nN) as well as the van der Waals rare-gas oxide (RgO) clusters. The application of SEVI to the study of chemical reaction dynamics by the high-resolution mapping of bimolecular reactive potential energy surfaces is also discussed. Photodetachment of Cl^- \cdotH_1 and Cl^- \cdotCH_4 anions probes the shallow well at the entrance of the Cl+H_2 and Cl+CH_4 reactive surfaces, while SEVI of the F^-\cdotH_2 and F^-\cdotH_4 anions probes transition state structure in the F+H_2 and F+CH_4 reactions., Recent detections of massive black holes (BHs), with masses of roughly 10^6-10 9 [Special characters omitted.] , in both our own Milky Way and in other galaxies suggest that central galactic BHs are common. In this work, we attempt to shed some light on the relatively new population of local intermediate-mass BHs (10^3 -10^6 [Special characters omitted.] ) that reside at the low-mass end of the central BH mass distribution. This population is important because it represents the closest analogue of primordial galactic BHs, not far removed from the first ""seed"" BHs. Understanding the characteristics of this population will help constrain any seed BH formation model. <P />We begin in Chapter 2 by looking at the properties of elliptical galaxies, nearly all of which likely host a massive BH. Although elliptical galaxies were thought to be a very homogeneous class, whose properties scaled simply with increasing mass, we show with the large sample available from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) that important deviations exist between low-mass and high- mass elliptical galaxies. Such differences arise due to slightly varied formation histories, predominantly involving the fraction of baryonic mass in gas (as opposed to stars) during merger events that build up elliptical galaxies. The gas fraction, higher in low-mass ellipticals, alters the structure of the remnant elliptical because gas is collisional and dissipative, whereas stars are dissipationless. Carefully understanding these host-galaxy properties will be key in future studies. <P />In Chapter 3, we present multiwavelength observations of NGC 4395, the least luminous Seyfert AGN known. NGC 4395 is special for two reasons: (a) the AGN resides in an essentially bulgeless host spiral, challenging the deep connection that is prevalent between massive BHs and host bulges; and (b) the central BH is thought to have a mass of only ~10^5 [Special characters omitted.] , placing it squarely in the intermediate-mass BH regime. We present results from reverberation mapping, a technique that is used to estimate the mass of the central BH ( M BH ). We estimate M BH [approximate] 3 × 10^5 [Special characters omitted.] , consistent with another reverberation result based on simultaneous UV observations. <P />In Chapter 4, we present an archival study of Chandra X-ray Telescope data, in which we search for AGN signatures in a population of bulgeless or nearly- bulgeless late-type spiral galaxies. Motivated by the case of NGC 4395, it is unclear how many BHs exist in bulgeless systems. Optical studies are notoriously poorly suited for this task, since BHs in such late-type spirals are likely of low mass (since the host galaxy is equally of low mass) and thus have very weak AGN signatures. In addition, late-type spirals have relatively large amounts of circumnuclear gas and dust, which easily obscures optical radiation. X-ray photons are largely unaffected (excluding exceptionally large columns of gas) and are therefore a more reliable indicator of central AGN activity (even weak, radiatively inefficient accretion). Unfortunately, stellar-mass BH binaries are equally capable of producing such X-ray emission, and we lack the depth, spacial resolution, and sensitivity to make a definitive identification. Based on nuclear stellar densities and the probability of finding an X-ray binary, we still conclude that roughly ~20-25% of bulgeless galaxies host an AGN, implying that objects such as NGC 4395 are not as rare as once thought. <P />Finally, in Chapter 5, we present a comprehensive X-ray study of a large sample of intermediate-mass BHs discovered in SDSS via optical identification of broad emission lines. Such BHs, while sampling a mass regime that is poorly understood, are biased toward high accretion rates to make them optically identifiable. Interestingly, such high-accretion, low-mass BHs behave in many ways like narrow-line Seyfert 1 nuclei (a higher-mass cousin), except that in general the low-mass sample is X-ray bright. This result is surprising, and we suggest it may arise from a slim disk, an accretion-disk structure which differs from the usual geometrically thin and optically thick disk normally associated with high accretion rates. Slim disks are thought to arise in systems with Eddington or super-Eddington accretion. Although the precise physical explanation is still elusive, it is surprising that optically selected AGNs should exhibit such differing broader spectral energy distributions. (Abstract shortened by UMI.), We show that a suitably defined marked correlation function can be used to break degeneracies in halo-occupation distribution modelling. The statistic can be computed on both three-dimensional and two-dimensional data sets and should be applicable to all upcoming galaxy surveys. A proof of principle, using mock catalogues created from N-body simulations, is given., The International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL) is discovering hundreds of new hard X-ray sources, many of which remain unidentified. We report on optical spectroscopy of five such sources for which X-ray observations at lower energies (~0.5-10 keV) and higher angular resolutions than INTEGRAL have allowed for unique optical counterparts to be located. We find that INTEGRAL Gamma-Ray (IGR) J16426+6536 and IGR J22292+6647 are Type 1 Seyfert active galactic nuclei (with IGR J16426+6536 further classified as a Seyfert 1.5) which have redshifts of z = 0.323 and z = 0.113, respectively. IGR J18308-1232 is identified as a cataclysmic variable (CV), and we confirm a previous identification of IGR J19267+1325 as a magnetic CV. IGR J18214-1318 is identified as an obscured high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB), which are systems thought to have a compact object embedded in the stellar wind of a massive star. We combine Chandra fluxes with distances based on the optical observations to calculate X-ray luminosities of the HMXB and CVs, finding L <SUB>0.3-10 keV </SUB> = 5 × 10<SUP>36</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> for IGR J18214-1318, L <SUB>0.3-10 keV </SUB> = 1.3 × 10<SUP>32</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> for IGR J18308-1232, and L <SUB>0.3-10 keV</SUB> = 6.7 × 10<SUP>32</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> for IGR J19267+1325., Data from the five-satellite Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) constellation suitably located to study solar wind magnetospheric coupling during the austral winter of 2007 were compared to data from ground-based all-sky imagers (ASIs) at South Pole (74° magnetic latitude) and at AGO-1 (80° magnetic latitude). The THEMIS constellation entered and exited the magnetosphere near magnetic midday on 10 and 12 August 2007, respectively. On 12 August interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) (B <SUB> z </SUB> &gt; 0) the dayside aurora was located more poleward between AGO-1 and South Pole. The THEMIS satellites traversing the magnetopause saw it move in and out several times during the satellite crossings. The inward motion of the magnetopause was sometimes correlated with equatorward expansions of the aurora and sometimes with solar wind pressure pulses as seen by Geotail. The B <SUB> z </SUB> &gt; 0 auroral latitude was consistent with dayside cusp “spot” seen by the IMAGE spacecraft and had been associated with footprints of “steady state” lobe reconnection. The aurora consisted of a continuous stream of poleward moving auroral forms (PMAF) even during a period of slightly B <SUB> z </SUB> &gt; 0 and B <SUB> y </SUB> = 0. On 10 August 2007 IMF B <SUB> z </SUB> &lt; 0 the dayside aurora was located more equatorward, over South Pole, and the THEMIS satellites crossed the bow shock from the magnetosheath into the solar wind. Negative B <SUB> z </SUB> pulses observed at the satellite were correlated with large poleward expansions of the dayside aurora consistent with reconnection in the subsolar region accompanied by simultaneous plasma density increases at THEMIS B satellite consistent with outward radial motion of the bow shock., Accretion discs with masses ~10<SUP>-3</SUP>-0.1M<SUB>solar</SUB> are believed to form during the merger of a neutron star (NS) with another NS and the merger of a NS with a black hole (BH). Soon after their formation, such hyperaccreting discs cool efficiently by neutrino emission and their composition is driven neutron-rich by pair captures under degenerate conditions. However, as the disc viscously spreads and its temperature drops, neutrino cooling is no longer able to offset viscous heating and the disc becomes advective. Analytic arguments and numerical simulations suggest that once this occurs, powerful winds likely drive away most of the disc's remaining mass. We calculate the thermal evolution and nuclear composition of viscously spreading accretion discs formed from compact object mergers using one-dimensional height-integrated simulations. We show that freeze-out from weak equilibrium necessarily accompanies the disc's late-time transition to an advective state. As a result, hyperaccreting discs generically freeze-out neutron-rich (with electron fraction Y<SUB>e</SUB> ~ 0.2-0.4), and their late-time outflows robustly synthesize rare neutron-rich isotopes. Using the measured abundances of these isotopes in our Solar system, we constrain the compact object merger rate in the Milky Way to be &lt;~10<SUP>-5</SUP>(M<SUB>d,0</SUB>/0.1M<SUB>solar</SUB>)<SUP>-1</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, where M<SUB>d,0</SUB> is the average initial mass of the accretion disc. Thus, either the NS-NS merger rate is at the low end of current estimates or the average disc mass produced during a typical merger is &lt;&lt;0.1M<SUB>solar</SUB>. Based on the results of current general relativistic merger simulations, the latter constraint suggests that prompt collapse to a BH is a more common outcome of NS-NS mergers than the formation of a transient hypermassive NS. We also show that if most short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are produced by compact object mergers, their beaming fraction must exceed f<SUB>b</SUB> ~ 0.13(M<SUB>d,0</SUB>/0.1M<SUB>solar</SUB>), corresponding to a jet half-opening angle &gt;~30° (M<SUB>d,0</SUB>/0.1M<SUB>solar</SUB>)<SUP>1/2</SUP>. This is consistent with other evidence that short-duration GRB outflows are less collimated than those produced in long-duration GRBs., In the multiverse, as in AdS space, light cones relate bulk points to boundary scales. This holographic UV-IR connection defines a preferred global time cutoff that regulates the divergences of eternal inflation. An entirely different cutoff, the causal patch, arises in the holographic description of black holes. Remarkably, I find evidence that these two regulators define the same probability measure in the multiverse. Initial conditions for the causal patch are controlled by the late-time attractor regime of the global description., We investigate the role of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the global coronal magnetic field reconfiguration, a debate that has lasted for about two decades. Key evidence of the coronal field restructuring during the 2007 December 31 CME is provided by combining imaging observations from widely separated spacecraft with the potential-field source-surface (PFSS) model, thanks to the extraordinarily quiet Sun at the present solar minimum. The helmet streamer, previously disrupted by the CME, re-forms but is displaced southward permanently; the preexisting heliospheric plasma sheet (HPS) is also disrupted as evidenced by the concave-outward shape of the CME. The south polar coronal hole shrinks considerably. Plasma blobs moving outward along the newly formed HPS suggest the occurrence of magnetic reconnection between the fields blown open by the CME and the ambient adjacent open fields. A streamer-like structure is also observed in the wake of the CME and interpreted as a plasma sheet where the thin post-CME current sheet is embedded. These results are important for understanding the coronal field evolution over a solar cycle as well as the complete picture of CME initiation and propagation., Oscillations in Earth's liquid core with periods of several decades are inferred from variations in the magnetic field. The observed periods are consistent with a type of hydromagnetic wave known as torsional oscillations. These oscillations represent a set of very-low-frequency normal modes in which the internal magnetic field provides the primary restoring force. By adapting the methods of normal-mode seismology, we construct estimates for the internal structure of the magnetic field and several other key parameters, including the viscosity of the inner core. The structure of the recovered field provides useful insights into the nature of convection. We find evidence of columnar convection in the core, and estimate the strength of the field generated by these flows (~0.3 mT). We also use the normal modes to recover the excitation source for the oscillations. Much of the excitation appears to originate near the surface of a cylinder that is tangent to the equator of the inner core. Distinct events rise above a background level of excitation, and may be related to instabilities in the geodynamo., The dense molecular cloud cores that form stars, like other self-gravitating objects, undergo bulk oscillations. Just at the point of gravitational instability, their fundamental oscillation mode has zero frequency. We study, using perturbation theory, the evolution of a spherical cloud that possesses such a frozen mode. We find that the cloud undergoes a prolonged epoch of subsonic, accelerating contraction. This slow contraction occurs whether the cloud is initially inflated or compressed by the oscillation. The subsonic motion described here could underlie the spectral infall signature observed in many starless dense cores., South Pole ice is predicted to be the best medium for acoustic neutrino detection. Moreover, ice is the only medium in which all three dense-medium detection methods (optical, radio, and acoustic) can be used to monitor the same interaction volume. Events detected in coincidence between two methods allow significant background rejection confidence, which is necessary to study rare GZK neutrinos. In 2007 and 2008 the South Pole Acoustic Test Setup (SPATS) was installed as a research and development project associated with the IceCube experiment. The purpose of SPATS is to measure the acoustic ice properties at the South Pole in order to determine the feasibility of a future large hybrid array. The deployment and performance of SPATS are described, as are first results and work in progress on the sound speed, background noise, and attenuation., We analyze all RHESSI measurements from 2002 to 2005 (29 flare events) of the 2.223 MeV neutron-capture γ-ray line and &gt;0.3 MeV electron bremsstrahlung continuum emissions, produced by &gt;30 MeV accelerated protons (depending on assumptions) and &gt;0.3 MeV accelerated electrons, respectively. We find a close proportionality between the two emissions over &gt;3 orders of magnitude in fluence, from the largest flares down to the limits of detectability. This implies that the processes in flares that accelerate electrons above 0.3 MeV and protons above 30 MeV are closely related, and that the relative acceleration of these two populations is roughly independent of flare size. We find an overall weak correlation between the 2.223 MeV fluence and the peak GOES 1-8 Å soft X-ray (SXR) flux, but with a close proportionality for flares with 2.223 MeV fluence above a threshold of 50 ph cm<SUP>-2</SUP> (equivalent to ~2 × 10<SUP>31</SUP> protons &gt;30 MeV). Below this threshold the flares usually have large (M-class or higher) but generally uncorrelated excess SXR emission. Thus, above this threshold it appears that flares reach a maximum efficiency for &gt;30 MeV proton and relativistic (&gt;0.3 MeV) electron acceleration, with proportionate amounts of energy going to flare SXR thermal emission and to &gt;50 keV electrons. Finally, we find that the electron-to-proton ratios—J<SUB>e</SUB> (0.5 MeV)/J<SUB>p</SUB> (10 MeV)—in these flares, obtained from the γ-ray observations, are about 2 orders of magnitude larger than the ratios in gradual solar energetic particle (SEP) events, but are comparable with ratios in impulsive SEP events., Attempts to constrain the Hubble constant using the strong gravitational lens system Q0957+561 are limited by systematic uncertainties in the mass model, since the time delay is known very precisely. One important systematic effect is the mass-sheet degeneracy, which arises because strong lens modeling cannot constrain the presence or absence of a uniform mass sheet κ, which rescales H <SUB>0</SUB> by the factor (1 - κ). In this paper, we present new constraints on the mass sheet derived from a weak-lensing analysis of the Hubble Space Telescope imaging of a 6 arcmin square region surrounding the lensed quasar. The average mass sheet within a circular aperture (the strong lens model region) is constrained by integrating the tangential weak gravitational shear over the surrounding area. We find the average convergence within a 30'' radius around the lens galaxy to be κ(&lt;30'') = 0.166 ± 0.056 (1σ confidence level), normalized to the quasar redshift. This includes contributions from both the lens galaxy and the surrounding cluster. We also constrain a few other low-order terms in the lens potential by applying a multipole aperture mass formalism to the gravitational shear in an annulus around the strong-lensing region. Implications for strong lens models and the Hubble constant are discussed in an accompanying paper., The magnetic field of the solar corona has a large-scale dipole character, which maps into the bipolar field in the solar wind. Using standard representations of the coronal field, we show that high-energy ions can be trapped stably in these large-scale closed fields. The drift shells that describe the conservation of the third adiabatic invariant may have complicated geometries. Particles trapped in these zones would resemble the Van Allen belts and could have detectable consequences. We discuss potential sources of trapped particles., Reconnection models of solar flares predict a systematic motion of hard X-ray (HXR) footpoints as magnetic energy is released and electrons are accelerated. While the correlation of the HXR flux with the apparent motion of the footpoints has previously been investigated, we derive and investigate for the first time the correlation between cumulative deposited energy at the footpoints and their separation. Providing excellent statistics, data from the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager of the 2002 July 23 flare are re-analyzed. The data show an excellent correlation for most of the time intervals. However, despite the good correlation, for some time ranges the derived amount of released magnetic energy is far too small to account for the energy in HXR-producing electrons., Heterogeneities in crustal magma chambers are generated by incomplete mixing of different batches of magmas, precipitation or remelting of solids ~ 10-20% denser than surrounding liquids at cooling/heating boundaries, and by liquid extraction from more dense crystalline residues. Volcanic eruptions commonly sample that heterogeneity as many deposits from large explosive events show gradients in composition, crystallinity and temperature. However, some of the most viscous of all magmas - crystal-rich rhyolites-dacites and large silicic plutons - are, in contrast, strikingly homogeneous. This observation is in stark contradiction to the common assumption that the main homogenizing process in magma chambers is mechanical mixing by convection. The timescale for convective stirring is governed by flow velocities. The faster the convective currents, the more rapidly mixing occurs. However, it is the total amount of strain that determines whether homogeneity can be attained. Here, we show that convectiving magma body needs 5-10 overturns following the introduction of heterogeneities to be homogenized to lengthscales at which diffusion is effective, irrespective of the vigor of the convection. For heterogeneities that are discrete in time and space and mechanically passive (such as patches of magmas with slightly different characteristics), the threshold of 5-10 overturns can potentially be reached if enough time is allowed for the system to convect. For heterogeneities that are continuously re-established or introduced by the convective process itself (such as density instabilities generated by crystallization at the cooling boundaries of magma chambers), convective stirring is unable to produce complete homogeneity. Therefore, to explain the low variability in major element whole-rock composition in crystal-rich dacitic/rhyolitic ignimbrites and silicic plutons, we propose that another mechanism of homogenization acts to decrease thermal, and related crystallinity variability at high crystal fraction (&gt; 50 vol.%). It is induced by latent heat buffering of silicic magmas close to the haplogranitic eutectic, and leads to the rapid equilibration of temperature (and crystal fraction) throughout the magma reservoir. As this process drives the magma body towards a uniformly high crystallinity (""crystal mush""), we refer to it as ""mushification"". Nevertheless, the homogeneity of both large crystal-rich silicic ignimbrites and granites also require (1) incremental growth dominated by addition of magma batches that are compositionally similar to reach the observed large sizes without inducing unmixable chemical heterogeneities and (2) some late convective stirring at high crystallinity to explain the dispersal of externally derived crystalline material, e.g. xenocrysts and antecrysts. Late mechanical mixing mostly occurs at high crystallinity (~ 30-50 vol.% crystals) following the intrusion of hotter magmas (and gas) from below, triggering whole-reservoir convective overturn without introducing new significant gradients., Using deep infrared observations conducted with the MOIRCS imager on the Subaru Telescope in the northern GOODS field combined with public surveys in GOODS-S, we investigate the dependence on stellar mass, M <SUB>*</SUB>, and galaxy type of the close pair fraction (5 h <SUP>-1</SUP> kpc &lt; r <SUB>sep</SUB> &lt; 20 h <SUP>-1</SUP> kpc) and implied merger rate. In terms of combined depth and survey area, our publicly available mass-limited sample represents a significant improvement over earlier infrared surveys used for this purpose. In common with some recent studies, we find that the fraction of paired systems that could result in major mergers is low (~4%) and does not increase significantly with redshift to z ≈ 1.2, with vprop(1 + z)<SUP>1.6±1.6</SUP>. Our key finding is that massive galaxies with M <SUB>*</SUB>&gt;10<SUP>11</SUP> M <SUB>sun</SUB> are more likely to host merging companions than less massive systems (M <SUB>*</SUB> ~ 10<SUP>10</SUP> M <SUB>sun</SUB>). We find evidence for a higher pair fraction for red, spheroidal hosts compared to blue, late-type systems, in line with expectations based on clustering at small scales. The so-called ""dry"" mergers between early-type galaxies devoid of star formation (SF) represent nearly 50% of close pairs with M <SUB>*</SUB>&gt;3 × 10<SUP>10</SUP> M <SUB>sun</SUB> at z ~ 0.5, but less than 30% at z ~ 1. This result can be explained by the increasing abundance of red, early-type galaxies at these masses. We compare the volumetric merger rate of galaxies with different masses to mass-dependent trends in galaxy evolution. Our results reaffirm the conclusion of Bundy et al. that major mergers do not fully account for the formation of spheroidal galaxies since z ~ 1. In terms of mass assembly, major mergers contribute little to galaxy growth below M <SUB>*</SUB> ~ 3 × 10<SUP>10</SUP> M <SUB>sun</SUB> but play a more significant role among galaxies with M <SUB>*</SUB> gsim 10<SUP>11</SUP> M <SUB>sun</SUB> ~ 30% of which have undergone mostly dry mergers over the observed redshift range. Overall, the relatively rapid and recent coalescence of high-mass galaxies mirrors the expected hierarchical growth of halos and is consistent with recent model predictions, even if the top-down suppression of SF and morphological evolution (i.e., ""downsizing"") involves additional physical processes. <P />Based on observations collected at the Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, and with the NASA/ESA HST, obtained at STScI, which is operated by AURA, under NASA contract NAS5-26555., Understanding the connection between coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and their interplanetary counterparts (ICMEs) is one of the most important problems in solar-terrestrial physics. We calculate the rotation of erupting field structures predicted by numerical simulations of CME initiation via the magnetic breakout model. In this model, the initial potential magnetic field has a multipolar topology and the system is driven by imposing a shear flow at the photospheric boundary. Our results yield insight on how to connect solar observations of the orientation of the filament or polarity inversion line (PIL) in the CME source region, the orientation of the CME axis as inferred from coronagraph images, and the ICME flux rope orientation obtained from in situ measurements. We present the results of two numerical simulations that differ only in the direction of the applied shearing motions (i.e., the handedness of the sheared-arcade systems and their resulting CME fields). In both simulations, eruptive flare reconnection occurs underneath the rapidly expanding sheared fields transforming the ejecta fields into three-dimensional flux rope structures. As the erupting flux ropes propagate through the low corona (from 2 to 4 R <SUB>sun</SUB>) the right-handed breakout flux rope rotates clockwise and the left-handed breakout flux rope rotates counterclockwise, in agreement with recent observations of the rotation of erupting filaments. We find that by 3.5 R <SUB>sun</SUB> the average rotation angle between the flux rope axes and the active region PIL is approximately 50°. We discuss the implications of these results for predicting, from the observed chirality of the pre-eruption filament and/or other properties of the CME source region, the direction and amount of rotation that magnetic flux rope structures will experience during eruption. We also discuss the implications of our results for CME initiation models., We use the observed distribution of Eddington ratios as a function of supermassive black hole (BH) mass to constrain models of quasar/active galactic nucleus (AGN) lifetimes and light curves. Given the observed (well constrained) AGN luminosity function, a particular model for AGN light curves L(t) or, equivalently, the distribution of AGN lifetimes (time above a given luminosity t(&gt;L)) translates directly and uniquely (without further assumptions) to a predicted distribution of Eddington ratios at each BH mass. Models for self-regulated BH growth, in which feedback produces a self-regulating ""decay"" or ""blowout"" phase after the AGN reaches some peak luminosity/BH mass and begins to expel gas and shut down accretion, make specific predictions for the light curves/lifetimes, distinct from, e.g., the expected distribution if AGN simply shut down by gas starvation (without feedback) and very different from the prediction of simple phenomenological ""light bulb"" scenarios. We show that the present observations of the Eddington ratio distribution, spanning nearly 5 orders of magnitude in Eddington ratio, 3 orders of magnitude in BH mass, and redshifts z = 0-1, agree well with the predictions of self-regulated models, and rule out phenomenological ""light bulb"" or pure exponential models, as well as gas starvation models, at high significance (~5σ). We also compare with observations of the distribution of Eddington ratios at a given AGN luminosity, and find similar good agreement (but show that these observations are much less constraining). We fit the functional form of the quasar lifetime distribution and provide these fits for use, and show how the Eddington ratio distributions place precise, tight limits on the AGN lifetimes at various luminosities, in agreement with model predictions. We compare with independent estimates of episodic lifetimes and use this to constrain the shape of the typical AGN light curve, and provide simple analytic fits to these for use in other analyses. Given these constraints, the average local BH must have gained its mass in no more than a couple of bright, near peak-luminosity episodes, in agreement with models of accretion triggering in interactions and mergers., We present a new technique for observationally identifying galaxy mergers spectroscopically rather than through host galaxy imaging. Our technique exploits the dynamics of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) powering active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in merger-remnant galaxies. Because structure in the universe is built up through galaxy mergers and nearly all galaxies host a central SMBH, some galaxies should possess two SMBHs near their centers as the result of a recent merger. These SMBHs spiral to the center of the resultant merger-remnant galaxy, and one or both of the SMBHs may power AGNs. Using the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey, we have examined 1881 red galaxies, of which 91 exhibit [O III] and Hβ emission lines indicative of Seyfert 2 activity. Of these, 32 AGNs have [O III] emission-line redshifts significantly different from the redshifts of the host galaxies' stars, corresponding to velocity offsets of ~50 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> to ~300 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Two of these AGNs exhibit double-peaked [O III] emission lines, while the remaining 30 AGNs each exhibit a single set of velocity-offset [O III] emission lines. After exploring a variety of physical models for these velocity offsets, we argue that the most likely explanation is inspiralling SMBHs in merger-remnant galaxies. Based on this interpretation, we find that roughly half of the red galaxies hosting AGNs are also merger remnants, which implies that mergers may trigger AGN activity in red galaxies. The AGN velocity offsets we find imply a merger fraction of ~30% and a merger rate of ~3 mergers Gyr<SUP>-1</SUP> for red galaxies at redshifts 0.34 &lt; z &lt; 0.82., A leading interpretation of the electron/positron excesses seen by PAMELA and ATIC is dark matter annihilation in the galactic halo. Depending on the annihilation channel, the electron/positron signal could be accompanied by a galactic gamma ray or neutrino flux, and the non-detection of such fluxes constrains the couplings and halo properties of dark matter. In this paper, we study the interplay of electron data with gamma ray and neutrino constraints in the context of cascade annihilation models, where dark matter annihilates into light degrees of freedom which in turn decay into leptons in one or more steps. Electron and muon cascades give a reasonable fit to the PAMELA and ATIC data. Compared to direct annihilation, cascade annihilations can soften gamma ray constraints from final state radiation by an order of magnitude. However, if dark matter annihilates primarily into muons, the neutrino constraints are robust regardless of the number of cascade decay steps. We also examine the electron data and gamma ray/neutrino constraints on the recently proposed ``axion portal'' scenario., We propose that the leptonic cosmic ray signals seen by PAMELA and ATIC result from the annihilation or decay of dark matter particles via states of a leptonic Higgs doublet to τ leptons, linking cosmic ray signals of dark matter to LHC signals of the Higgs sector. The states of the leptonic Higgs doublet are lighter than about 200 GeV, yielding large bar tauτ and bar tauτbar tauτ event rates at the LHC. Simple models are given for the dark matter particle and its interactions with the leptonic Higgs, for cosmic ray signals arising from both annihilations and decays in the galactic halo. For the case of annihilations, cosmic photon and neutrino signals are on the verge of discovery., The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) is optimized for fine energy and spatial resolution observations of hard x-ray (HXR) emission from solar flares. In many RHESSI flares, most of this emission originates from the bright flare loop footpoints. Fainter sources located higher in the corona are often not visible due to RHESSI's limited dynamic range. However, flares which are partially occulted (i.e. have footpoints obscured by the solar disk) allow for detailed observations of faint coronal HXR sources. <P />We have determined occultation heights for 55 RHESSI flares from 2002-2004 and compared the occultation heights with nonthermal flux. Compared with statistical results of on-disk flares, it is estimated that the coronal emission is 10-100 times fainter than the expected footpoint emission, confirming that these coronal sources would not have been visible in the presence of footpoints. <P />Occulted flares can be used to investigate the role of flare-accelerated electrons in heating ambient coronal plasma. With this aim, we compare RHESSI images of nonthermal HXR from energetic electrons with TRACE images made using the 195-angstrom filter, which has a sensitivity maximum at 1.5 MK. The locations and time profiles of the nonthermal and thermal sources are compared to investigate whether the heating seen by TRACE is due to the same electrons that emit the HXR seen by RHESSI., The new balloon-borne Gamma-Ray Imager/Polarimeter for Solar flares (GRIPS) instrument will provide a near-optimal combination of high-resolution imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetry of solar-flare gamma-ray/hard X-ray emissions from 20 keV to &gt; 10 MeV. GRIPS will address questions relevant to particle acceleration and energy release that have been raised by recent solar flare observations, such as: What causes the spatial separation between energetic electron producing hard X-rays and energetic ions producing gamma-ray lines? How anisotropic are the accelerated electrons, and why do relativistic electron dominate in the corona? How does the composition of accelerated and ambient material vary with space and time, and why? <P />The spectrometer/polarimeter consists of sixteen 3D position-sensitive germanium detectors (3D-GeDs), where each energy deposition is individually recorded. Imaging is accomplished by a single multi-pitch rotating modulator (MPRM) situated 8 meters from the spectrometer to provide excellent image quality and unparalleled angular resolution at gamma-ray energies (12.5 arcsec FWHM), using a similar technique to rotating-modulation-collimator imaging used on missions such as RHESSI but now taking advantage of the position sensitivity of the spectrometer. Polarimetry is accomplished by analyzing the anisotropy of reconstructed Compton scattering in the 3D-GeDs (i.e. as an active scatterer). A balloon platform for this instrument minimizes atmospheric attenuation and accommodates its weight and size, and long-duration balloon flights (LDBFs) from Antarctica allow for month-long uninterrupted observations of the Sun to continuously observe active regions and to maximize the chance of capturing a gamma-ray flare. A continental-US test flight is slated for 2012 with the eventual goal of Antarctic LDBFs of the completed instrument. In addition to the direct science return from these flights, GRIPS will prove these technologies for a future space-based mission., Traditional ideas for testing unification involve searching for the decay of the proton and its branching modes. We point out that several astrophysical experiments are now reaching sensitivities that allow them to explore supersymmetric unified theories. In these theories the electroweak-mass dark matter particle can decay, just like the proton, through dimension 6 operators with lifetime ∼10<SUP>26</SUP>s. Interestingly, this time scale is now being investigated in several experiments including ATIC, PAMELA, HESS, and Fermi. Positive evidence for such decays may be opening our first direct window to physics at the supersymmetric unification scale of M<SUB>GUT</SUB>∼10<SUP>16</SUP>GeV, as well as the TeV scale. Moreover, in the same supersymmetric unified theories, dimension 5 operators can lead a weak-scale superparticle to decay with a lifetime of ∼100s. Such decays are recorded by a change in the primordial light element abundances and may well explain the present discord between the measured Li abundances and standard big bang nucleosynthesis, opening another window to unification. These theories make concrete predictions for the spectrum and signatures at the LHC as well as Fermi., A survey of Wind and ACE data has been performed to address the generality of previous reports of extremely extended reconnection X-lines in the solar wind. We have studied 51 events in which both Wind and ACE detected the same solar wind current sheets and one of the spacecraft observed a reconnection exhaust. In 50 of the 51 events, the other spacecraft also observed essentially the same reconnection signatures, and all but one of the jets pointed in the same direction at both spacecraft. In 7 of these cases, the X-line extended more than 100 Earth radii (or 10<SUP>4</SUP> ion skin depths). Our findings strongly indicate that reconnection X-lines in large-scale current sheets (with magnetic shear &gt;∼70°) are fundamentally extended, and not patchy and randomly distributed in space. Finally, the extended reconnecting current sheets are typically highly planar, indicating no significant current sheet warping associated with the reconnection process., We expect many of the same plasma physics processes observed in the terrestrial magnetosphere, including collisionless reconnection and viscous boundary layer processes, to also operate in other planetary environments. We now present observations from Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) that may provide evidence for the occurrence of these processes around Mars. While MGS lacks the full plasma instrumentation and multi- point measurements that have proven crucial in understanding these processes at the Earth, it does have magnetic field and electron measurements from the Magnetometer/Electron Reflectometer instrument. We discuss MAG/ER observations of flux ropes, bipolar magnetic field signatures, and field-aligned electron flows possibly indicative of reconnection in the Martian magnetotail current sheet. We also describe quasi-periodic fluctuations in electron flux and magnetic field above the Martian dayside suggestive of boundary layer processes such as the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Magnetotail and boundary layer processes such as these may contribute to the loss of ionized planetary gases from the Martian atmosphere, one of the primary science goals of the MAVEN Mars Scout mission currently in development., Previous observations have shown that auroral activity and intense auroral emission are more common when the ionosphere is in darkness and are suppressed when the ionosphere is in daylight. This suggests that the ionospheric conductivity plays an important role governing how magnetospheric energy is transferred to the ionosphere during substorms. More recent analyses have indicated that the recovery time scales of substorms occurring in the winter and near equinox (when the nighttime auroral zone was in darkness) were roughly twice as long as the recovery time scales for substorms occurring in the summer (when the nighttime auroral region was sunlit). These results strongly suggest that auroral substorms in the northern and southern hemispheres develop differently during solstice conditions with substorms lasting longer in the dark (winter) hemisphere than in the sunlit (summer) hemisphere. This also implies that more energy is deposited by electron precipitation in the winter hemisphere than in the summer one during substorms. Therefore, the ionosphere itself may dictate how much energy it will accept from the magnetosphere during substorms rather than this being an externally imposed quantity. What is lacking, however, is a detailed investigation of how individual substorms develop in the conjugate hemispheres. Here, we extend earlier work by analyzing the recovery time scales for substorms observed in the conjugate hemsiphere simultaneously by two orbiting global auroral imagers: Polar UVI and IMAGE FUV. The results presented here will lead to new insights into the role of the ionosphere in the transport of energy during substorms., With the advent of ALMA astronomers will be able to routinely use millimeter-wave observations of molecules and dust to study galaxies at cosmological distances. Open questions remain, however, on how CO relates to H_2, and how HI and H_2 relate to star formation activity in local systems. In an ongoing effort to understand how the tracers of molecular gas relate to the total molecular mass and to other properties of galaxies, we will discuss the analysis of resolved molecular cloud properties from combined single-dish and interferometric data in nearby dwarf galaxies -- the closest primitive systems. This analysis shows that, despite a variety of underlying physical conditions, Giant Molecular Clouds have very similar properties from galaxy to galaxy, including the Milky Way. However, we find that CO is not a good tracer of total molecular mass in low metallicity systems. In the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), the galaxy with lowest heavy element abundance where CO has been detected, we analyze a combination of Spitzer and IRAS data to obtain a map of H_2 accross the galaxy and compare it to CO. We use this measurement of total molecular mass to place the SMC in star formation rate/molecular mass space, and we find that it falls on the same Schmidt-Law relationship as larger galaxies when only H_2 is considered., Radial X-ray diffraction measurements are performed on CaSiO <SUB>3</SUB>perovskite between 25.5 and 49.3 GPa at 300 K. The Rietveld method is used to extract quantitative texture and stress information. We find some mismatches in lattice strains evaluated in the Rietveld method with variations of d-spacings for 2 0 0 and 2 1 0 over-estimated while those for 1 1 1 are under-estimated and attribute it to the effect of plastic deformation. The differential stress supported by CaSiO <SUB>3</SUB> perovskite in this study is approximately twice as large as previous measurements and the ratio of differential stress to shear modulus t/G varies between 5.4% and 7.2% between 25 and 49 GPa. The sample displays preferred orientation of the {1 0 0} planes perpendicular to the compression direction, compatible with slip on {110}&lt;11¯0&gt;., We present ground based observations of Io taken with a high spatial resolution imaging spectrometer on 1 and 2 June 2006. We mapped the 1.98 and 2.12 μm absorptions of SO <SUB>2</SUB> frost, across Io's surface. We analyze these data with surface reflectance modeling using the Hapke method to determine the general frost distribution. This analysis also determined a lower limit of 700 μm on the grain size for the areas of strongest absorption. We incorporate our findings of a predominantly equatorial distribution of SO <SUB>2</SUB> frost, with the maps of Carlson et al. [Carlson, R.W., Smythe, W.D., Lopes-Gautier, R.M.C., Davies, A.G., Kamp, L.W., Mosher, J.A., Soderblom, L.A., Leader, F.E., Mehlman, R., Clark, R.N., Fanale, F.P., 1997. Geophys. Res. Lett. 24, 2479-2482], McEwen [McEwen, A.S., 1988. Icarus 73, 385-426] and Douté et al. [Douté, S., Schmitt, B., Lopes-Gautier, R., Carlson, R., Soderblom, L., Shirley, J., and The Galileo NIMS Team, 2001. Icarus 149, 107-132] to produce a self consistent explanation of the global distribution of SO <SUB>2</SUB>. We propose that the differences between the above maps is attributable, in part, to the different bands that were studied by the investigators., The International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL) is discovering hundreds of new hard X-ray sources, many of which remain unidentified. We report on optical spectroscopy of five such sources for which X-ray observations at lower energies (∼0.5-10 keV) and higher angular resolutions than INTEGRAL have allowed for unique optical counterparts to be located. We find that IGR J16426+6536 and IGR J22292+6647 are Type 1 Seyfert active galactic nuclei (with IGR J16426+6536 further classified as a Seyfert 1.5) which have redshifts of z = 0.323 and z = 0.113, respectively. IGR J18308-1232 is identified as a cataclysmic variable (CV), and we confirm a previous identification of IGR J19267+1325 as a magnetic CV. IGR J18214-1318 is identified as an obscured high mass X-ray binary (HMXB), which are systems thought to have a compact object embedded in the stellar wind of a massive star. We combine Chandra fluxes with distances based on the optical observations to calculate X-ray luminosities of the HMXB and CVs, finding L<SUB>0.3-10 keV</SUB> = 5 x 10<SUP>36</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> for IGR J18214-1318, L<SUB>0.3-10 keV</SUB> =1.3 x10<SUP>32</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> for IGR J18308-1232, and L<SUB>0.3-10 keV</SUB> = 6.7 x 10<SUP>32</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> for IGR J19267+1325. <P />SCB acknowledges partial support from Chandra awards GO7-8050X and GO8-9055X issued by the Chandra X-ray Observatory Center. Also, SCB is partially supported by a UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellowship and an SSL Summer Science Fellowship., We present visual-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy of supernova (SN) 2008S. Based on the low peak luminosity for a SN of M<SUB>R</SUB> = -13.9 mag, photometric and spectral evolution unlike that of low-luminosity SNe, a late-time decline rate slower than <SUP>56</SUP>Co decay, and slow outflow speeds of 600-1000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, we conclude that SN 2008S is not a true core-collapse SN and is probably not an electron-capture SN. Instead, we show that SN 2008S more closely resembles an ""SN impostor"" event like SN 1997bs, analogous to the giant eruptions of luminous blue variables (LBVs). Its total radiated energy was ~10<SUP>47.8</SUP> erg, and it may have ejected 0.05-0.2 M <SUB>sun</SUB> in the event. We discover an uncanny similarity between the spectrum of SN 2008S and that of the Galactic hypergiant IRC+10420, which is dominated by narrow Hα, [Ca II], and Ca II emission lines formed in an opaque wind. We propose a scenario where the vastly super-Eddington (Γ ≈ 40) wind of SN 2008S partly fails because of reduced opacity due to recombination, as suggested for IRC+10420. The range of initial masses susceptible to eruptive LBV-like mass loss was known to extend down to 20-25 M <SUB>sun</SUB>, but estimates for the progenitor of SN 2008S (and the similar NGC 300 transient) may extend this range to lsim15 M <SUB>sun</SUB>. As such, SN 2008S may have implications for the progenitor of SN 1987A., A portable microfabricated capillary electrophoresis (CE) system named the Mars Organic Analyzer (MOA) has been developed to analyze fluorescently-labeled biomarkers including amino acids, amines, nucleobases, and amino sugars with the goal of life detection on Mars (1,2). This technology has also been shown to be effective in screening the formation of biogenic amines during fermentation (3). The MOA is a part of the Urey instrument package that has been selected for the 2016 European ExoMars mission by ESA. The identification of recent gully erosion sites, observations of ice on and beneath the surface of Mars, and the discovery of large reservoirs of sub-surface ice on Mars point to water-ice as an important target for astrobiological analyses. In addition, the ice samples on the Moon, Mercury, Europa and Enceladus are of interest due to the possibility that they may contain information on biogenic material relevant to the evolution of life. We explore here the use of the MOA instrument for the analysis of amino acids in polar ice samples. The amino acids valine, alanine/serine, glycine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid were found in the parts-per-billion range from Greenland ice-core samples. Chiral analysis of these samples yielded D/L ratios of 0.51/0.09 for alanine/serine and 0.14/0.06 for aspartic acid. Individual amino acids in the parts-per-trillion range were found in Antarctic ice samples collected from the surface of a meteorite collection area. The distinct amino acid and amine content of these samples indicates that further biomarker characterization of ice samples as a function of sampling location, depth, and structural features will be highly informative. The rapid sensitive analysis capabilities demonstrated here establish the feasibility of using the MOA to analyze the biomarker content of ice samples in planetary exploration. 1. Skelley, A.

Chem. 2007, 79, 21, 8162., Solar flares accelerate both electrons and ions to high energies, with comparable energy content in each population, and thus observing the signatures of both populations is crucial to understanding the relevant acceleration processes. Accelerated electrons produce an X-ray signature via bremsstrahlung, while accelerated ions produce a variety of gamma-ray lines through nuclear interactions with the solar atmosphere that reveals not only spectral information of the accelerated population but also abundance information for both the accelerated and ambient populations. A comprehensive study of all RHESSI flares finds proportional acceleration of relativistic electrons above 300 keV and ions above 20 MeV/nucleon, which indicates a common acceleration process. This proportionality also provides constraints for acceleration models. The correlation worsens when considering electrons at lower energies, suggesting that electrons below 300 keV may also be accelerated by other processes. Future balloon-based gamma-ray observations by GRIPS with the unparalleled angular resolution of 12.5 arcseconds will further probe the spatial and angular distributions of both accelerated ions and electrons., The declining phases of solar cycles are known for their high speed solar wind streams that dominate the geomagnetic responses during this period. Outstanding questions about these streams, which can provide the fastest winds of the solar cycle, concern their solar origins, persistence, and predictability. The declining phase of cycle 23 has lasted significantly longer than the corresponding phases of the previous two cycles. Solar magnetograph observations suggest that the solar polar magnetic field is also ∼ 2 - 3 times weaker. The launch of STEREO in late 2006 provided additional incentive to examine the origins of what is observed at 1 AU in the recent cycle, with the OMNI data base at the NSSDC available as an Earth/L1 baseline for comparisons. Here we focus on the year 2007 when the solar corona exhibited large, long-lived mid-to-low latitude coronal holes and polar hole extensions observed by both SOHO and STEREO imagers. STEREO provides in situ measurements consistent with rigidly corotating solar wind stream structure at up to ∼ 45° heliolongitude separation by late 2007. This stability justifies the use of magnetogram-based steady 3D solar wind models to map the observed high speed winds back to their coronal sources. We apply the WSA solar wind model currently running at the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center with the expectation that it should perform its best at this quiet time. The model comparisons confirm the origins of the observed high speed streams expected from the solar images, but also reveal uncertainties in the solar wind source mapping associated with this cycle's weaker solar polar fields. Overall, the results illustrate the importance of having accurate polar fields in synoptic maps used in solar wind forecast models. At the most fundamental level, they demonstrate the control of the solar polar fields over the high speed wind sources, and thus one specific connection between the solar dynamo and the solar wind character., The 2008 M7.9 Wenchuan earthquake in Sichuan, China, caused water level to oscillate and undergo sustained changes in Taiwan, ∼2000 km away from the epicenter. Here we use the responses in three wells recorded at high sampling rate (1 Hz) and the broadband seismograms from a nearby station to document, for the first time, that the major water-level responses associated with Rayleigh waves were preceded by small oscillations that occurred concurrently with S waves and Love waves. We also show that the groundwater flow associated with these small oscillations may be strong enough to remove blockades from sediment pores to enhance aquifer permeability and to facilitate the later major responses., Many previously proposed models for polar cap cascades (and almost all quantitative models) assumed stationary particle outflow. Predictions of such models disagree with both observational data (e.g. the number of electron-positron pairs in the Crab nebula is 100 higher than predicted) and results of numerical models of force-free pulsar magnetosphere (the current density required to support force-free magnetosphere differs substantially from what stationary model for PC cascade predicts). On the other hand, the stability of stationary models has not been quantitatively studied. I decided to study the problem from the first principles, namely to model the accelerating electric field, particle acceleration and pair production simultaneously. In order to do this I developed a hybrid Particle-In-Cell -- Monte Carlo code for direct self-consistent time-dependent modeling of polar cap cascades. In this talk I'll <P />discuss problems of the ""standard"" pulsar model, describe my approach to the problem, and report on first results of cascade modeling., The current solar cycle minimum seems to have unusual properties that appear to be related to weak solar polar magnetic fields. We investigate signatures of this unusual polar field in the ecliptic near-Earth interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) for the STEREO period of observations. Using 1 AU OMNI data, we find that for the current solar cycle declining phase to minimum period the peak of the distribution for the values of the ecliptic IMF magnitude is lower compared to a similar phase of the previous solar cycle. We investigate the sources of these weak fields. Our results suggest that they are related to the solar wind stream structure, which is enhanced by the weak polar fields. The direct role of the solar field is therefore complicated by this effect, which redistributes the solar magnetic flux at 1 AU nonuniformly at low to mid heliolatitudes., Galaxies are believed to be in one-to-one correspondence with simulated dark matter subhaloes. We use high-resolution N-body simulations of cosmological volumes to calculate the statistical properties of subhalo (galaxy) major mergers at high redshift (z = 0.6-5). We measure the evolution of the galaxy merger rate, finding that it is much shallower than the merger rate of dark matter host haloes at z &gt; 2.5, but roughly parallels that of haloes at z &lt; 1.6. We also track the detailed merger histories of individual galaxies and measure the likelihood of multiple mergers per halo or subhalo. We examine satellite merger statistics in detail: 15-35 per cent of all recently merged galaxies are satellites, and satellites are twice as likely as centrals to have had a recent major merger. Finally, we show how the differing evolution of the merger rates of haloes and galaxies leads to the evolution of the average satellite occupation per halo, noting that for a fixed halo mass, the satellite halo occupation peaks at z ~ 2.5., It has been realized for some time that the slow solar wind with its embedded heliospheric current sheet often exhibits complex features suggesting at least partially transient origin. In this paper we investigate the structure of the slow solar wind using the observations by the Wind and STEREO spacecraft during two Carrington rotations (2054 and 2055). These occur at the time of minimum solar activity when the interplanetary medium is dominated by recurrent high-speed streams and large-scale interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are rare. However, the signatures of transients with small scale-sizes and/or low magnetic field strength (comparable with the typical solar wind value, ∼ 5 nT) are frequently found in the slow solar wind at these times. These events do not exhibit significant speed gradients across the structure, but instead appear to move with the surrounding flow. Source mapping using models based on GONG magnetograms suggests that these transients come from the vicinity of coronal source surface sector boundaries. In situ they are correspondingly observed in the vicinity of high density structures where the dominant electron heat flux reverses its flow polarity. These weak transients might be indications of dynamical changes at the coronal hole boundaries or at the edges of the helmet streamer belt previously reported in coronagraph observations. Our analysis supports the idea that even at solar minimum, a considerable fraction of the slow solar wind is transient in nature., We report the discovery of the first low-mass planet to emerge from the NASA-UC Eta-Earth Program, a super-Earth orbiting the K0 dwarf HD 7924. Keplerian modeling of precise Doppler radial velocities reveals a planet with minimum mass M<SUB>P</SUB> sin i = 9.26 M <SUB>⊕</SUB> in a P = 5.398 d orbit. Based on Keck-HIRES measurements from 2001 to 2008, the planet is robustly detected with an estimated false alarm probability of less than 0.001. Photometric observations using the Automated Photometric Telescopes at Fairborn Observatory show that HD 7924 is photometrically constant over the radial velocity period to 0.19 mmag, supporting the existence of the planetary companion. No transits were detected down to a photometric limit of ~0.5 mmag, eliminating transiting planets with a variety of compositions. HD 7924b is one of only eight planets detected by the radial velocity technique with M<SUB>P</SUB> sin i &lt; 10 M <SUB>⊕</SUB> and as such is a member of an emerging family of low-mass planets that together constrain theories of planet formation. <P />Based on observations obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated jointly by the University of California and the California Institute of Technology. Keck time has been granted by both NASA and the University of California., We study the detectability and characterization of electron beams as they leave their acceleration site in the low corona toward interplanetary space through their nonthermal X-ray bremsstrahlung emission. We demonstrate that the largest interplanetary electron beams (gsim10<SUP>35</SUP> electrons above 10 keV) can be detected in X-rays with current and future instrumentation, such as RHESSI or the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) onboard Hinode. We make a list of optimal observing conditions and beam characteristics. Amongst others, good imaging (as opposed to mere localization or detection in spatially integrated data) is required for proper characterization, putting the requirement on the number of escaping electrons (above 10 keV) to gsim3 × 10<SUP>36</SUP> for RHESSI, gsim3 × 10<SUP>35</SUP> for Hinode/XRT, and gsim10<SUP>33</SUP> electrons for the FOXSI sounding rocket scheduled to fly in 2011. Moreover, we have found that simple modeling hints at the possibility that coronal soft X-ray jets could be the result of local heating by propagating electron beams., A multipoint analysis of conjugate magnetospheric and ionospheric flow vortices during the formation of the substorm current wedge (SCW) on 19 February 2008 is presented. During the substorm, four Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) spacecraft were located close to the neutral sheet in the premidnight region between 9 and 12 R <SUB> E </SUB> geocentric distance, of which three closely (∼1-2 R <SUB> E </SUB>) clustered at ∼23 MLT and one was farther west at ∼21 MLT. The closely clustered spacecraft were engulfed by a counterclockwise plasma flow vortex, while the single spacecraft recorded a clockwise plasma flow vortex. Simultaneously, a pair of conjugate flow vortices with clockwise and counterclockwise rotation appeared in the ionosphere, as inferred from equivalent ionospheric currents. The counterclockwise space vortex, which corresponded to a downward field-aligned current, was at least 1-2 R <SUB> E </SUB> in diameter and had rotational flow speeds of up to 900 km/s. Current density estimates associated with the formation of the space vortex in the first 30 s yielded 2.8 nA/m<SUP>2</SUP> (14 μA/m<SUP>2</SUP> mapped to the ionosphere), or a total current of 1.1 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> A. Model calculations based on midlatitude ground magnetometer data show a gradual increase of the field-aligned current, with 1-2 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> A within the first minute and a peak value of 7 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> A after 10 min, associated with the SCW, and a matching meridian of the downward current of the SCW and the downward current (counterclockwise) space vortex. The combined ground and space observations, together with the model results, present a scenario in which the space vortices generated the field-aligned current of the SCW at the beginning of the substorm expansion phase and coupled to the ionosphere, causing the ionospheric vortices., Recent developments in string theory have led to ``realistic"" string compactifications which lead to moduli stabilization while generating a hierarchy between the Electroweak and Planck scales at the same time. However, this seems to suggest a rethink of our standard notions of cosmological evolution after the end of inflation and before the beginning of BBN. This epoch is crucial for addressing the issues of neutrino masses, baryon asymmetry, Dark Matter (DM) abundance and the moduli (gravitino) problem. We argue that within classes of realistic string compactifications as defined above, there generically exists a light modulus with a mass comparable to that of the gravitino which is typically much smaller than the Hubble parameter during inflation. Therefore, it is destabilized and generates a large late-time entropy when it decays. Thus, all known elegant mechanisms of generating the baryon asymmetry of the Universe in the literature have to take this fact into account. In this work, we find that it is still possible to naturally generate the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe as well as light left-handed neutrino masses from a period of Affleck-Dine (AD) leptogenesis shortly after the end of inflation, in classes of realistic string constructions with a minimal extension of the MSSM below the unification scale (consisting only of right-handed neutrinos) and satisfying certain microscopic criteria described in the text. The AD mechanism has already been used to generate the baryon asymmetry in the literature; however in this work we have embedded the above mechanism within a framework well motivated from string theory and have tried to describe the epoch from the end of inflation to the beginning of BBN in a complete and self-consistent manner. The consequences of our analysis are as follows. The lightest left-handed neutrino is required to be virtually massless. The moduli (gravitino) problem can be naturally solved in this framework both within gravity and gauge mediation. The observed upper bound on the relic abundance constrains the moduli-matter and moduli-gravitino couplings since the DM is produced non-thermally within this framework. Finally, although not a definite prediction, the framework naturally allows a light right-handed neutrino and sneutrinos around the electroweak scale which could have important implications for the nature of DM as well as the LHC., We analyzed lunar surface charging during solar energetic particle (SEP) events, utilizing Lunar Prospector measurements of surface potentials and electron fluxes, and upstream energetic particle data. Outside of the magnetosphere, we find a nearly one-to-one correspondence between extreme negative lunar surface charging and large solar proton events. Using new techniques to correct for spacecraft potential, we present the first quantitative measurements of lunar charging during SEP events, during which we find that the nightside surface reaches potentials of up to -4.5 kV, with negative potentials of a kilovolt or larger often observed. These potentials are far higher than typical nightside potentials of a few hundred volts negative and may increase the risk of electrostatic discharge and/or dust effects, introducing an additional hazard to the already dangerous radiation environment. For eight of eleven event periods, surface potentials correlate with electron temperature and with the ratio of energetic electron flux to both energetic proton flux and total electron flux. For these eight events, charging models taking into account both thermal/suprathermal and energetic particle fluxes, as well as secondary emission, can successfully predict surface potentials. However, during the other three events, surface potentials do not correlate with the same measurable quantities, and charging models cannot reproduce measured potentials. In order to develop reliable and accurate models for lunar surface charging during SEP events, we will need better measurements of ion and energetic particle behavior in the lunar environment, secondary electron emission from lunar materials, and lunar surface potentials., We present mid-infrared spectral mapping observations of the core-collapse supernova remnant 1E 0102.2-7219 in the Small Magellanic Cloud using the InfraRed Spectrograph on the Spitzer Space Telescope. The remnant shows emission from fine structure transitions of neon and oxygen as well as continuum emission from dust. Comparison of the mid-IR dust emission with observations at X-ray, radio, and optical wavelengths shows that the dust is associated with the supernova ejecta and is thus newly formed in the remnant. The spectrum of the newly formed dust is well reproduced by a model that includes 3 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> M <SUB>sun</SUB> of amorphous carbon dust at 70 K and 2 × 10<SUP>-5</SUP> M <SUB>sun</SUB> of Mg<SUB>2</SUB>SiO<SUB>4</SUB> (forsterite) at 145 K. Our observations place a lower limit on the amount of dust in the remnant since we are not sensitive to the cold dust in the unshocked ejecta. We compare our results to observations of other core-collapse supernovae and remnants, particularly Cas A where very similar spectral mapping observations have been carried out. We observe a factor of ~10 less dust in E 0102 than seen in Cas A, although the amounts of amorphous carbon and forsterite are comparable. Finally, we present evidence suggesting that the grain size distribution of the newly formed dust in E 0102 has been altered by the hot plasma behind the reverse shock., We present the most general curvature obstruction to the deformed parabolic orthosymplectic symmetry subalgebra of the supersymmetric quantum mechanical models recently developed to describe Lichnerowicz wave operators acting on arbitrary tensors and spinors. For geometries possessing a hypersurface-orthogonal homothetic conformal Killing vector we show that the parabolic subalgebra is enhanced to a (curvature-obstructed) orthosymplectic algebra. The new symmetries correspond to time-dependent conformal symmetries of the underlying particle model. We also comment on generalizations germane to three dimensions and new Chern-Simons-like particle models., Constraining the frequency dependence of intrinsic seismic attenuation in the Earth is crucial for: 1. correcting for velocity dispersion due to attenuation; 2. constructing attenuation and velocity models of the interior using datasets with different frequency contents; and, 3. interpreting lateral variations of velocity and attenuation in terms of temperature and composition. Frequency dependence of attenuation q can be represented by a power law q ∝ q<SUB>0</SUB>ω<SUP> - α</SUP>. Despite its importance, efforts at determining α from surface wave and free oscillation data have been thwarted by the strong tradeoffs between the depth- and frequency dependence of attenuation. We develop and validate a new method that eliminates this tradeoff, allowing a direct estimation of effective frequency dependence of attenuation without having to construct a new depth-dependent model of attenuation. Using normal mode and surface wave attenuation measurements between 80 and 3000 s, we find that α varies with frequency within the absorption band. It is 0.3 at periods shorter than 200 s, it decreases to 0.1 between 300 and 800 s, and becomes negative at periods longer than 1000 s., We report on observations of GRB 080503, a short gamma-ray burst (GRB) with very bright extended emission (about 30 times the gamma-ray fluence of the initial spike) in conjunction with a thorough comparison to other short Swift events. In spite of the prompt-emission brightness, however, the optical counterpart is extraordinarily faint, never exceeding 25 mag in deep observations starting at ~1 hr after the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) trigger. The optical brightness peaks at ~1 day and then falls sharply in a manner similar to the predictions of Li &amp; Paczyński (1998) for supernova-like emission following compact binary mergers. However, a shallow spectral index and similar evolution in X-rays inferred from Chandra observations are more consistent with an afterglow interpretation. The extreme faintness of this probable afterglow relative to the bright gamma-ray emission argues for a very low density medium surrounding the burst (a ""naked"" GRB), consistent with the lack of a coincident host galaxy down to 28.5 mag in deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging. The late optical and X-ray peak could be explained by a slightly off-axis jet or by a refreshed shock. Our observations reinforce the notion that short GRBs generally occur outside regions of active star formation, but demonstrate that in some cases the luminosity of the extended prompt emission can greatly exceed that of the short spike, which may constrain theoretical interpretation of this class of events. This extended emission is not the onset of an afterglow, and its relative brightness is probably either a viewing-angle effect or intrinsic to the central engine itself. Because most previous BAT short bursts without observed extended emission are too faint for this signature to have been detectable even if it were present at typical level, conclusions based solely on the observed presence or absence of extended emission in the existing Swift sample are premature., We present extensive photometry at ultraviolet (UV), optical, and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, as well as dense sampling of optical spectra, for the normal Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2005cf. The optical photometry, performed at eight different telescopes, shows a 1σ scatter of lsim0.03 mag after proper corrections for the instrument responses. From the well-sampled light curves, we find that SN 2005cf reached a B-band maximum at 13.63 ± 0.02 mag, with an observed luminosity decline rate Δm <SUB>15</SUB>(B) = 1.05 ± 0.03 mag. The correlations between the decline rate and various color indexes, recalibrated on the basis of an expanded SN Ia sample, yield a consistent estimate for the host-galaxy reddening of SN 2005cf, E(B - V)<SUB>host</SUB> = 0.10 ± 0.03 mag. The UV photometry was obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope and the Swift Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope, and the results match each other to within 0.1-0.2 mag. The UV light curves show similar evolution to the broadband U, with an exception in the 2000-2500 Å spectral range (corresponding to the F220W/uvm2 filters), where the light curve appears broader and much fainter than that on either side (likely owing to the intrinsic spectral evolution). Combining the UV data with the ground-based optical and NIR data, we establish the generic UV-optical-NIR bolometric light curve for SN 2005cf and derive the bolometric corrections in the absence of UV and/or NIR data. The overall spectral evolution of SN 2005cf is similar to that of a normal SN Ia, but with variety in the strength and profile of the main feature lines. The spectra at early times displayed strong, high-velocity (HV) features in the Ca II H&amp;K doublet and NIR triplet, which were distinctly detached from the photosphere (v ≈ 10,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) at a velocity ranging from 20,000 to 25,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. One interesting feature is the flat-bottomed absorption observed near 6000 Å in the earliest spectrum, which rapidly evolved into a triangular shape and then became a normal Si II λ6355 absorption profile at about one week before maximum brightness. This premaximum spectral evolution is perhaps due to the blending of the Si IIλ6355 at photospheric velocity and another HV absorption component (e.g., an Si II shell at a velocity ~18,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) in the outer ejecta, and may be common in other normal SNe Ia. The possible origin of the HV absorption features is briefly discussed., At the heart of future space-based astronomical UV instruments will be a sensitive UV detector. Though there has been a death of new UV mission opportunities, detector development has continued. Improvements have been made in spatial resolution, dynamic range, detector size, quantum efficiency and background. At the same time the power and mass required to achieve these goals have decreased. We review the current capabilities of microchannel plate based detectors at Berkeley, both in the laboratory and aboard current on-orbit spacecraft. We also discuss what can be expected from the next generation of UV detectors over the next decade., We report results from torsion experiments on polycrystalline halite (NaCl) to shear strains γ = 8 and observe a very complex texture evolution. The same behavior was reproduced with polycrystal plasticity simulations, suggesting that we capture the underlying mechanisms. While crystal shapes gradually rotate into the shear plane, crystal orientations change continuously and dynamic texture patterns evolve with increasing shear. This is highly significant for ultra-large deformation, as for example implied from geodynamic modeling for the deep earth, where seismic anisotropy patterns may develop and locally disappear again as material is deformed during convection. The study also suggests that caution is required when interpreting deformation mechanisms from simple shear preferred orientation patterns., In an earlier paper, we quantified the mean merger rate of dark matter haloes as a function of redshift z, descendant halo mass M<SUB>0</SUB>, and progenitor halo mass ratio ξ using the Millennium simulation of the Λ cold dark matter cosmology. Here, we broaden that study and investigate the dependence of the merger rate of haloes on their surrounding environment. A number of local mass overdensity variables, both including and excluding the halo mass itself, are tested as measures of a halo's environment. The simple functional dependence on z, M<SUB>0</SUB>, and ξ of the merger rate found in our earlier work, is largely preserved in different environments, but we find that the overall amplitude of the merger rate has a strong positive correlation with the environmental densities. For galaxy-mass haloes, we find mergers to occur ~2.5 times more frequently in the densest regions than in voids at both z = 0 and higher redshifts. Higher mass haloes show similar trends. We present a fitting form for this environmental dependence that is a function of both mass and local density and valid out to z = 2. The amplitude of the progenitor (or conditional) mass function shows a similar correlation with local overdensity, suggesting that the extended Press-Schechter model for halo growth needs to be modified to incorporate environmental effects., Spatial relationships between regions containing signatures of electron physics in asymmetric reconnection with a guide field are examined using simulations and space observations that are in excellent agreement. These electron physics regions do not completely overlap, are not confined to sizes ∼electron skin depth, and do not surround the X-line. The electron ideal Ohm's law, E + U <SUB>e</SUB> × B = 0, is violated over many ion inertia lengths in the outflow direction. Thus, pressure terms and, to a lesser extent, inertia terms in the Generalized Ohm's Law are important in producing electron physics on ion scales. Parallel electric fields that are necessary but not sufficient for reconnection are found in the simulation and in space on ion scales in the outflow direction. They account for ∼10% of j · E, averaged over the current sheet. The electron exhaust jet exists over a shorter length for asymmetric reconnection than it does for symmetric reconnection., The orbital motion of electrons in a three-dimensional solid can generate a pseudoscalar magnetoelectric coupling θ, a fact we derive for the single-particle case using a recent theory of polarization in weakly inhomogeneous materials. This polarizability θ is the same parameter that appears in the “axion electrodynamics” Lagrangian ΔL<SUB>EM</SUB>=(θe<SUP>2</SUP>/2πh)E·B, which is known to describe the unusual magnetoelectric properties of the three-dimensional topological insulator (θ=π). We compute θ for a simple model that accesses the topological insulator and discuss its connection to the surface Hall conductivity. The orbital magnetoelectric polarizability can be generalized to the many-particle wave function and defines the 3D topological insulator, like the integer quantum Hall effect, in terms of a topological ground-state response function., High-resolution simulations of cosmological structure formation indicate that dark matter substructure in dense environments, such as groups and clusters, may survive for a long time. These dark matter subhaloes are the likely hosts of galaxies. We examine the small-scale spatial clustering of subhalo major mergers at high redshift using high-resolution N-body simulations of cosmological volumes. Recently merged, massive subhaloes exhibit enhanced clustering on scales ~100-300h<SUP>-1</SUP>kpc, relative to all subhaloes of the same infall mass, for a short time after a major merger (&lt;500Myr). The small-scale clustering enhancement is smaller for lower mass subhaloes, which also show a deficit on scales just beyond the excess. Haloes hosting recent subhalo mergers tend to have more subhaloes; for massive subhaloes, the excess is stronger and it tends to increase for the most massive host haloes. The subhalo merger fraction is independent of halo mass for the scales we probe. In terms of satellite and central subhaloes, the merger increase in small-scale clustering for massive subhaloes arises from recently merged massive central subhaloes having an enhanced satellite population. Our mergers are defined via their parent infall mass ratios. Subhaloes experiencing major mass gains also exhibit a small-scale clustering enhancement, but these correspond to two-body interactions leading to two final subhaloes, rather than subhalo coalescence., In the epoch of precise and accurate cosmology, cross-confirmation using a variety of cosmographic methods is paramount to circumvent systematic uncertainties. Owing to progenitor histories and explosion physics differing from those of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), Type II-plateau supernovae (SNe II-P) are unlikely to be affected by evolution in the same way. Based on a new analysis of 17 SNe II-P, and on an improved methodology, we find that SNe II-P are good standardizable candles, almost comparable to SNe Ia. We derive a tight Hubble diagram with a dispersion of 10% in distance, using the simple correlation between luminosity and photospheric velocity introduced by Hamuy and Pinto. We show that the descendent method of Nugent et al. can be further simplified and that the correction for dust extinction has low statistical impact. We find that our SN sample favors, on average, a very steep dust law with total to selective extinction R<SUB>V</SUB> &lt; 2. Such an extinction law has been recently inferred for many SNe Ia. Our results indicate that a distance measurement can be obtained with a single spectrum of a SN II-P during the plateau phase combined with sparse photometric measurements., Recent observations of the low-latitude F-region ionosphere at times near equinox have shown that it varies with a predominant zonal wavenumber-four pattern in a fixed local-time frame. It has been shown that this pattern corresponds well to the non-migrating diurnal eastward wavenumber-three atmospheric tide (DE3) at E-region altitudes simulated by the Global Scale Wave Model (GSWM). Here we present details of the morphology of the F-region ionosphere from TIMED GUVI with simultaneous observations of the non-migrating diurnal tides at E-region altitudes from TIMED SABER. For the case of equinox (March 2002), the correspondence of the SABER and GUVI observations confirms the relationship previously established using the GSWM simulations. There is also a wavenumber-one signature that is present which may be related to the semi-diurnal westward wavenumber-three, possibly in conjunction with changes in the magnetic field with longitude. During July 2002, when the amplitude of the DE3 maximizes, the amplitude of the wavenumber-four pattern in the F-region ionosphere intensifies. There is also evidence of a strong wavenumber-three pattern in the F-region ionosphere, which can be attributed to the strong diurnal eastward wavenumber-two tide during this period. During January 2003, the amplitude of all non-migrating components observed by SABER are either small or asymmetric and the ionosphere does not display either a wavenumber-three or -four pattern. During both solstice periods, a strong wavenumber-one is seen that is attributed to the offset of the subsolar point and the geomagnetic equator that maximizes at solstice, possibly in conjunction with other geomagnetic effects. During all seasons, significant hemispheric asymmetries in the airglow wavenumber spectra are seen. The combined GUVI and SABER observations presented here demonstrate that the large-scale periodic longitudinal structure of the F-region ionosphere responds significantly to changes in the forcing by non-migrating diurnal tides at E-region altitudes., Galactic cosmic ray (GCR) measurements of the phosphorus, sulfur, argon, and calcium isotopes made by the Cosmic Ray Isotope Spectrometer aboard the Advanced Composition Explorer are reported over the energy range from ~100 to ~400 MeV nucleon<SUP>-1</SUP>. The propagation of cosmic rays through the Galaxy and heliosphere is modeled with constraints imposed by measurements. Isotopic source abundance ratios <SUP>31</SUP>P/<SUP>32</SUP>S, <SUP>34</SUP>S/<SUP>32</SUP>S, <SUP>38</SUP>Ar/<SUP>36</SUP>Ar, and <SUP>44</SUP>Ca/<SUP>40</SUP>Ca are deduced. The derived <SUP>31</SUP>P/<SUP>32</SUP>S ratio is 2.34 ± 0.34 times larger than the solar system value, lending further credence to the suggestion that refractory elements are enriched in the GCRs due to the sputtering of ions off grains in the cores of superbubbles. By determining the GCR source abundances of argon (a noble gas) and calcium (a refractory), it is determined that material in grains is accelerated to GCR energies a factor of 6.4 ± 0.3 more efficiently than gas-phase material in this charge range. With this information, the dust fraction of phosphorus and sulfur in the interstellar material that is mixed with stellar ejecta to form the GCR seed material is found to be consistent with astronomical observations., We extend the definition of “spectral dimension” d<SUB>s</SUB> (usually defined for fractal and lattice geometries) to theories in spacetimes with anisotropic scaling. We show that in gravity with dynamical critical exponent z in D+1 dimensions, the spectral dimension of spacetime is d<SUB>s</SUB>=1+(D)/(z). In the case of gravity in 3+1 dimensions with z=3 in the UV which flows to z=1 in the IR, the spectral dimension changes from d<SUB>s</SUB>=4 at large scales to d<SUB>s</SUB>=2 at short distances. Remarkably, this is the behavior found numerically by Ambjørn et al. in their causal dynamical triangulations approach to quantum gravity., The areal centroids of the youngest polar deposits on Mars are offset from those of adjacent paleopolar deposits by 5-10°. We test the hypothesis that the offset is the result of True Polar Wander (TPW), the motion of the solid surface with respect to the spin axis, caused by a mass redistribution within or on the surface of Mars. In particular, we consider the possibility that TPW is driven by late-stage volcanism during the Late Hesperian to Amazonian. There is observational and qualitative support for this hypothesis: in both north and south, observed offsets lie close to a great circle 90° from Tharsis, as expected for polar wander after Tharsis formed. We calculate the magnitude and direction of TPW produced by mapped late-stage lavas for a range of lithospheric thicknesses, lava thicknesses, eruption histories, and prior polar wander events. We find that if Tharsis formed close to the equator, the stabilizing effect of a fossil rotational bulge located close to the equator leads to predicted TPW of &lt; 2°, too small to account for observed offsets. If, however, Tharsis formed far from the equator, late-stage TPW driven by low-latitude, late-stage volcanism would be 6-33°, similar to that inferred from the location of paleopolar deposits. A volume of 4.4 ± 1.3 × 10 <SUP>19</SUP> kg of young erupted lava can account for the offset of the Dorsa Argentea Formation from the present-day south rotation pole. This volume is consistent with prior mapping-based estimates and would imply a mass release of CO <SUB>2</SUB> by volcanic degassing similar to that in the atmosphere at the present time. The South Polar Layered Deposits are offset from the present rotation pole in a direction that is opposite to the other paleopolar deposits. This can be explained by either a sequential eruption of late-stage lavas, or an additional contribution from a plume beneath Elysium. We predict that significant volcanic activity occurred during the time interval represented by the Basal Unit/Planum Boreum unconformity; Planum Boreum postdates the Promethei Lingula Lobe; and that the north polar deposits span a substantial fraction of Solar System history. If the additional contribution to TPW from plumes is small, then we would also predict that Tharsis Montes Formation postdates the Promethei Lingula Lobe of the South Polar Layered Deposits. We conclude with a list of observational tests of the TPW hypothesis., We present the results of spectroscopic observations from the ESSENCE high-redshift supernova (SN) survey during its first four years of operation. This sample includes spectra of all SNe Ia whose light curves were presented by Miknaitis et al. and used in the cosmological analyses of Davis et al. and Wood-Vasey et al. The sample represents 273 hr of spectroscopic observations with 6.5-10 m class telescopes of objects detected and selected for spectroscopy by the ESSENCE team. We present 184 spectra of 156 objects. Combining this sample with that of Matheson et al., we have a total sample of 329 spectra of 274 objects. From this, we are able to spectroscopically classify 118 Type Ia SNe. As the survey has matured, the efficiency of classifying SNe Ia has remained constant while we have observed both higher-redshift SNe Ia and SNe Ia farther from maximum brightness. Examining the subsample of SNe Ia with host-galaxy redshifts shows that redshifts derived from only the SN Ia spectra are consistent with redshifts found from host-galaxy spectra. Moreover, the phases derived from only the SN Ia spectra are consistent with those derived from light-curve fits. By comparing our spectra to local templates, we find that the rate of objects similar to the overluminous SN 1991T and the underluminous SN 1991bg in our sample are consistent with that of the local sample. We do note, however, that we detect no object spectroscopically or photometrically similar to SN 1991bg. Although systematic effects could reduce the high-redshift rate we expect based on the low-redshift surveys, it is possible that SN 1991bg-like SNe Ia are less prevalent at high redshift., The Galactic center (GC) lobe is a degree-tall shell seen in radio continuum images of the GC region. If it is actually located in the GC region, formation models would require massive energy input (e.g., starburst or jet) to create it. At present, observations have not strongly constrained the location or physical conditions of the GC lobe. This paper describes the analysis of new and archival single-dish observations of radio recombination lines toward this enigmatic object. The observations find that the ionized gas has a morphology similar to the radio continuum emission, suggesting that they are associated. We study averages of several transitions from H106α to H191epsilon and find that the line ratios are most consistent with gas in local thermodynamic equilibrium. The radio recombination line widths are remarkably narrow, constraining the typical electron temperature to be less than about 4000 K. These observations also find evidence of pressure broadening in the higher electronic states, implying a gas density of n<SUB>e</SUB> = 910<SUP>+310</SUP> <SUB>-450</SUB> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. The electron temperature, gas pressure, and morphology are all consistent with the idea that the GC lobe is located in the GC region. If so, the ionized gas appears to form a shell surrounding the central 100 parsecs of the galaxy with a mass of roughly 10<SUP>5</SUP> M <SUB>sun</SUB>, similar to ionized outflows seen in dwarf starbursts., The recent robust and homogeneous analysis of the world's supernova distance-redshift data, together with cosmic microwave background and baryon acoustic oscillation data—provides a powerful tool for constraining cosmological models. Here we examine particular classes of scalar field, modified gravity, and phenomenological models to assess whether they are consistent with observations even when their behavior deviates from the cosmological constant Λ. Some models have tension with the data, while others survive only by approaching the cosmological constant, and a couple are statistically favored over Λ cold dark matter. Dark energy described by two equation-of-state parameters has considerable phase space to avoid Λ and next-generation data will be required to constrain such physics, with the level of complementarity between probes varying with cosmology., Recent far-ultraviolet (FUV) observations of Earth have shown the remarkable spatial correspondence between the amplitude of non-migrating atmospheric tides originating in the troposphere and the density and morphology of the nighttime equatorial ionospheric anomaly (EIA). This is likely a result of the modulation of the E-region dynamo electric field in daytime by the tidal winds. FUV observations around the time of the vernal equinox of 2002 show that the signature of tidal influence, the wave-4 periodicity in the separation and density of the two EIA bands, itself exhibits significant temporal variability. Here, we seek to understand this variability, and whether (or not) it is linked to variations in the strength of the upward-propagating tides. This study relies on tidal measurements provided by the global observations from the TIMED-SABER instrument that measures the temperature variations in the MLT associated with the upward-propagating tides. TIMED-GUVI provides F-region density measurements concurrent to the MLT temperature retrievals. It is found that the atmospheric and ionospheric zonal wave-4 signatures very nearly covary over a 30-day period, strongly supporting the theory that the influence of the the diurnal eastward 3 (DE3) tide originating in the troposphere extends to the F-layer of the ionosphere. Additionally, a 6-day periodicity in the power of the ionospheric wave-4 signature is found that may originate with the tide's interaction with longer period planetary waves., Motivated by the galactic positron excess seen by PAMELA and ATIC/PPB-BETS, we propose that dark matter is a TeV-scale particle that annihilates into a pseudoscalar “axion.” The positron excess and the absence of an antiproton or gamma ray excess constrain the axion mass and branching ratios. In the simplest realization, the axion is associated with a Peccei-Quinn symmetry, in which case it has a mass around 360-800 MeV and decays into muons. We present a simple and predictive supersymmetric model implementing this scenario, where both the Higgsino and dark matter obtain masses from the same source of TeV-scale spontaneous symmetry breaking., We present a candidate quantum field theory of gravity with dynamical critical exponent equal to z=3 in the UV. (As in condensed-matter systems, z measures the degree of anisotropy between space and time.) This theory, which at short distances describes interacting nonrelativistic gravitons, is power-counting renormalizable in 3+1 dimensions. When restricted to satisfy the condition of detailed balance, this theory is intimately related to topologically massive gravity in three dimensions, and the geometry of the Cotton tensor. At long distances, this theory flows naturally to the relativistic value z=1, and could therefore serve as a possible candidate for a UV completion of Einstein’s general relativity or an infrared modification thereof. The effective speed of light, the Newton constant and the cosmological constant all emerge from relevant deformations of the deeply nonrelativistic z=3 theory at short distances., We present a simple model of how quasars occupy dark matter haloes from z = 0 to 5 using the observed m<SUB>BH</SUB>-σ relation and quasar luminosity functions. This provides a way for observers to statistically infer host halo masses for quasar observations using luminosity and redshift alone. Our model is deliberately simple and sidesteps any need to explicitly describe the physics. In spite of its simplicity, the model reproduces many key observations and has predictive power: (i) model quasars have the correct luminosity function (by construction) and spatial clustering (by consequence); (ii) we predict high-redshift quasars of a given luminosity live in less massive dark matter haloes than the same luminosity quasars at low redshifts; (iii) we predict a factor of ~5 more 10<SUP>8.5</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB> black holes at z ~ 2 than is currently observed; (iv) we predict a factor of ~20 evolution in the amplitude of the m<SUB>BH</SUB>-M<SUB>halo</SUB> relation between z = 5 and the present day; (v) we expect luminosity-dependent quasar lifetimes of between t<SUB>Q</SUB> ~ 10<SUP>7</SUP> and 10<SUP>8</SUP>yr, but which may become as short as 10<SUP>5-6</SUP>yr for quasars brighter than L* and (vi) while little luminosity-dependent clustering evolution is expected at z &lt;~ 1, increasingly strong evolution is predicted for L &gt; L* quasars at higher redshifts. These last two results arise from the narrowing distribution of halo masses that quasars occupy as the Universe ages. We also deconstruct both `downsizing' and `upsizing' trends predicted by the model at different redshifts and space densities. Importantly, this work illustrates how current observations cannot distinguish between more complicated physically motivated quasar models and our simple phenomenological approach. It highlights the opportunities such methodologies provide., We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2005ip for the first 3 yr after discovery, showing an underlying Type II-L supernova (SN) interacting with a steady wind to yield an unusual Type IIn spectrum. For the first ~160 days, it had a fast linear decline from a modest peak absolute magnitude of about -17.4 (unfiltered), followed by a plateau at roughly -14.8 for more than 2 yr. Initially having a normal broad-lined spectrum superposed with sparse narrow lines from the photoionized circumstellar medium (CSM), it quickly developed signs of strong CSM interaction with a spectrum similar to that of SN 1988Z. As the underlying SN II-L faded, SN 2005ip exhibited a rich high-ionization spectrum with a dense forest of narrow coronal lines, unprecedented among SNe but reminiscent of some active galactic nuclei. The line-profile evolution of SN 2005ip confirms that dust formation caused its recently reported infrared excess, but these lines reveal that it is the first SN to show clear evidence for dust in both the fast SN ejecta and the slower postshock gas. SN 2005ip's complex spectrum confirms the origin of the strange blue continuum in SN 2006jc, which also had postshock dust formation. We suggest that SN 2005ip's late-time plateau and coronal spectrum result from rejuvenated CSM interaction between a sustained fast shock and a clumpy stellar wind, where X-rays escape through the optically thin interclump regions to heat the preshock CSM to coronal temperatures., We report on a ~12 hr XMM-Newton observation of the supergiant high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) IGR J16207 - 5129. This is only the second soft X-ray (0.4-15 keV, in this case) study of the source since it was discovered by the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory satellite. The average energy spectrum is very similar to those of neutron star HMXBs, being dominated by a highly absorbed power-law component with a photon index of Γ = 1.15<SUP>+0.07</SUP> <SUB>-0.05</SUB>. The spectrum also exhibits a soft excess below ~2 keV and an iron Kα emission line at 6.39 ± 0.03 keV. For the primary power-law component, the column density is (1.19<SUP>+0.06</SUP> <SUB>-0.05</SUB>) × 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, indicating local absorption, likely from the stellar wind, and placing IGR J16207 - 5129 in the category of obscured IGR HMXBs. The source exhibits a very high level of variability with an rms noise level of 64% ± 21% in the 10<SUP>-4</SUP>-0.05 Hz frequency range. Although the energy spectrum suggests that the system may harbor a neutron star, no pulsations are detected with a 90% confidence upper limit of ~2% in a frequency range from ~10<SUP>-4</SUP> to 88 Hz. We discuss similarities between IGR J16207 - 5129 and other apparently nonpulsating HMXBs, including other IGR HMXBs as well as 4U 2206+54 and 4U 1700 - 377., In situ and remote observations indicate that relativistic or ultra relativistic electrons are formed at various magnetized configurations. It is suggested that a specific bootstrap mechanism operates in some of these environments. The mechanism applies to (a) relativistic electrons observed on localized field lines in outer radiation belt - through a process initiated at a distant substorm injection; (b) relativistic electrons observed at the interplanetary medium - through a process initiated via coronal injection, at large distances from flares or propagating CME; (c) ultra-relativistic electrons deduced at the galactic jets - through a process initiated via local injection at the small-scale magnetic field. The injected nonisotropic electrons excite whistler waves which boost efficiently the tail of the electron distribution., We report on the discovery of a bright Lyα blob associated with the z = 3 quasar SDSS J124020.91+145535.6 which is also coincident with strong damped Lyα absorption from a foreground galaxy (a so-called proximate damped Lyα (PDLA) system). The one-dimensional spectrum acquired by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) shows a broad Lyα emission line with a FWHM sime500 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and a luminosity of L <SUB>Lyα</SUB> = 3.9 × 10<SUP>43</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> superposed on the trough of the PDLA. Follow-up observations using the Keck/LRIS spectrometer confirm that this source has a Lyα nebula with spatial extent exceeding 5'', corresponding to a proper size &gt;39 kpc. Mechanisms for powering the large Lyα luminosity in this nebula are discussed. We use a Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulation to investigate the possibility that the line emission is fluorescent recombination radiation from a kpc-scale PDLA galaxy powered by the ionizing flux of the quasar, but find that the predicted Lyα flux is several orders of magnitude lower than observed. We conclude that the Lyα emission is not associated with the PDLA galaxy at all, but instead is intrinsic to the quasar's host and similar to the extended Lyα ""fuzz"" which is detected around many active galactic nuclei. PDLAs are natural coronagraphs that block their background quasar at Lyα and we discuss how systems similar to SDSS J124020.91+145535.6 might be used to image the neutral hydrogen in the PDLA galaxy in silhouette against the screen of extended Lyα emission from the background quasar., We use observational data to show that 21 cm line profiles measured with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) are subject to significant inaccuracies. These include ∼10% errors in the calibrated gain and significant contribution from distant sidelobes. In addition, there are ∼60% variations between the GBT and Leiden/Argentine/Bonn 21 cm line profile intensities, which probably occur because of the high main-beam efficiency of the GBT. Stokes V profiles from the GBT contain inaccuracies that are related to the distant sidelobes. We illustrate these problems, define physically-motivated components for the sidelobes, and provide numerical results showing the inaccuracies. We provide a correction scheme for Stokes I 21 cm line profiles that is fairly successful, and provide some rule-of-thumb comments concerning the accuracy of Stokes V profiles., Abundant Mesozoic terrestrial fossils were discovered in the Haifanggou Formation and the overlying Lanqi Formation in northeastern China. The recent discovery of Schmeissneria sinensis from the Haifanggou Formation provides evidence that the origin of angiosperms could be much earlier than previously believed. 92 taxa of plant fossils from the Lanqi Formation provide unique opportunities to understand the floral evolution and its diversification in the Mesozoic. Here we present robust high-precision <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar data of 160.7 ± 0.4 Ma and 158.7 ± 0.6 Ma for two tuffs from the lowest part of the Lanqi Formation near the main outcrop of floral fossils in Beipiao City, Liaoning, China. Our age results indicate the whole Lanqi Formation was deposited in the Late Jurassic; consequently, the underlying Haifanggou Formation and Schmeissneria sinensis are at least Middle Jurassic in age. Besides its importance for floral evolution, our high-precision age results for the basal Lanqi Formation indicate the paleoenvironment in the north margin of the North China Craton was dry and hot in the Late Jurassic. Moreover, the new age data for the basal Lanqi Formation suggest that the unearthed fossils from the Haifanggou Formation and Lanqi Formation should be equivalent to the Daohugou Biota in Inner Mongolia, China., ElarmS is a network-based methodology for rapid earthquake detection, location and hazard assessment in the form of magnitude estimation and peak ground motion prediction. The methodology is currently being tested as part of the real-time seismic system in California leveraging the resources of the California Integrated Seismic Network (CISN) and the Advanced National Seismic System. A total of 603 velocity and acceleration sensors at 383 sites across the state stream waveform data to ElarmS processing modules at three network processing centers where waveforms are reduced to a few parameters. These parameters are then collected and processed at UC Berkeley to provide a single statewide prediction of future ground shaking that is updated every second. The system successfully detected the M<SUB>w</SUB> 5.4 Alum Rock earthquake in northern California for which it generated an accurate hazard prediction before peak shaking began in San Francisco. It also detected the M<SUB>w</SUB> 5.4 Chino Hills earthquake in southern California. The median system latency is currently 11.8 sec; the median waveform data latency is 6.5 sec., The gravitational growth index formalism provides a model independent way to look for deviations from general relativity by testing dark energy physics distinct from its effects on the cosmic expansion history. Here we extend the approach to incorporate an early time parameter g<SUB>⋆</SUB> in addition to the growth index in describing the growth of large-scale structure. We illustrate its utility for models with modified gravity at high redshift, early acceleration, or early dark energy. Future data will have the capability to constrain the dark energy equation of state, the growth index γ, and g<SUB>⋆</SUB> simultaneously, with no degradation in the equation of state determination., We propose a quantum theory of membranes designed such that the ground-state wavefunction of the membrane with compact spatial topology Σ<SUB>h</SUB> reproduces the partition function of the bosonic string on worldsheet Σ<SUB>h</SUB>. The construction involves worldvolume matter at quantum criticality, described in the simplest case by Lifshitz scalars with dynamical critical exponent z = 2. This matter system must be coupled to a novel theory of worldvolume gravity, also exhibiting quantum criticality with z = 2. We first construct such a nonrelativistic ``gravity at a Lifshitz point'' with z = 2 in D+1 spacetime dimensions, and then specialize to the critical case of D = 2 suitable for the membrane worldvolume. We also show that in the second-quantized framework, the string partition function is reproduced if the spacetime ground state takes the form of a Bose-Einstein condensate of membranes in their first-quantized ground states, correlated across all genera., Because of its proximity, the Small Magellanic Cloud provides a unique opportunity to map the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission from photo-dissociation regions (PDRs) in a low-metallicity (12 + log(O/H) ~ 8) galaxy at high spatial resolution in order to learn about their abundance and physical state. We present mid-IR spectral mapping observations of star-forming regions in the Small Magellanic Cloud obtained as part of the Spitzer Spectroscopic Survey of the SMC (S<SUP>4</SUP>MC) project. These observations allow us to map the distribution of PAH emission in these regions and the measure the variation of PAH band strengths with local physical conditions. In these proceedings we discuss preliminary results on the physical state of the PAHs, in particular their ionization fraction., Several correlations among parameters derived from modeling the high-energy properties of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been reported. We show that well known examples of these have common features indicative of strong contamination by selection effects. We focus here on the impact of detector threshold truncation on the spectral peak versus isotropic equivalent energy release (E <SUB>pk</SUB>-E <SUB>iso</SUB>) relation, extended to a large sample of 218 Swift and 56 HETE-2 GRBs with and without measured redshift. The existence of faint Swift events missing from pre-Swift surveys calls into question inferences based on pre-Swift surveys which must be subject to complicated incompleteness effects. We demonstrate a generalized method for treating data truncation in correlation analyses and apply this method to Swift and pre-Swift data. Also, we show that the E <SUB>pk</SUB>-E <SUB>γ</SUB> (""Ghirlanda"") correlation is effectively independent of the GRB redshifts, which suggests that its existence has little to do with intrinsic physics. We suggest that a physically based correlation, manifest observationally, must show significantly reduced scatter in the rest frame relative to the observer frame and must not persist if the assumed redshifts are scattered. As with the E <SUB>pk</SUB>-E <SUB>γ</SUB> correlation, we find that the pre-Swift, bright GRB E <SUB>pk</SUB>-E <SUB>iso</SUB> correlation of Amati does not rigorously satisfy these conditions., In this study, we investigate the shapes of starless and protostellar cores using hydrodynamic, self-gravitating adaptive mesh refinement simulations of turbulent molecular clouds. We simulate observations of these cores in dust emission, including realistic noise and telescope resolution, and compare to the observed core shapes measured in Orion by Nutter &amp; Ward-Thompson (2007). The simulations and the observations have generally high statistical similarity, with particularly good agreement between simulations and Orion B. Although protostellar cores tend to have semi-major axis to semi-minor axis ratios closer to one, the distribution of axis ratios for starless and protostellar cores is not significantly different for either the actual observations of Orion or the simulated observations. Because of the high level of agreement between the non-magnetic hydrodynamic simulations and observation, contrary to a number of previous authors, one cannot infer the presence of magnetic fields from core shape distributions., We develop a simple semianalytic model of the star formation rate as a function of time. We estimate the star formation rate for a wide range of values of the cosmological constant, spatial curvature, and primordial density contrast. Our model can predict such parameters in the multiverse, if the underlying theory landscape and the cosmological measure are known., We present an overview of selected optical technologies that are candidates for use in the CMBPOL satellite mission, indicate how the technologies are being tested, and estimate their Technology Readiness Level (TRL)., The molecular gas in galaxy disks shows much more galaxy to galaxy variation than does the atomic gas. Detailed studies show that this variation can be attributed to differences in hydrostatic pressure in the disks due largely to variations in the stellar surface density and the total gas surface density. One prediction of pressure modulated H<SUB>2</SUB> formation is that the location where HI and H<SUB>2</SUB> have equal surface densities occurs at a constant value of the stellar surface density in the disk. Observations confirm this constancy to 40%., We present multicolor optical observations of long-duration γ-ray bursts (GRBs) made over a three-year period with the robotic Palomar 60 inch telescope (P60). Our sample consists of all 29 events discovered by Swift for which P60 began observations less than 1 hr after the burst trigger. We were able to recover 80% of the optical afterglows from this prompt sample, and we attribute this high efficiency to our red coverage. Like Melandri et al. (2008), we find that a significant fraction (≈50%) of Swift events show a suppression of the optical flux with regard to the X-ray emission (the so-called ""dark"" bursts). Our multicolor photometry demonstrates this is likely due in large part to extinction in the host galaxy. We argue that previous studies, by selecting only the brightest and best-sampled optical afterglows, have significantly underestimated the amount of dust present in typical GRB environments., Signatures of lensing of the cosmic microwave background radiation by gravitational potentials along the line of sight carry with them information on the matter distribution, neutrino masses, and dark energy properties. We examine the constraints that Planck, PolarBear, and CMBpol future data, including from the B-mode polarization or the lensing potential, will be able to place on these quantities. We simultaneously fit for neutrino mass and dark energy equation of state including time variation and early dark energy density, and compare the use of polarization power spectra with an optimal quadratic estimator of the lensing. Results are given as a function of systematics level from residual foreground contamination. A realistic CMBpol experiment can effectively constrain the sum of neutrino masses to within 0.05 eV and the fraction of early dark energy to 0.002. We also present a surprisingly simple prescription for calculating dark energy equation of state constraints in combination with supernova distances from JDEM., We have reexamined our previously published data to search for evidence of correlations between the rates for the alpha, beta-minus, beta-plus, and electron capture decays of <SUP>22</SUP>Na, <SUP>44</SUP>Ti, <SUP>108</SUP>Ag<SUP>m</SUP>, <SUP>121</SUP>Sn<SUP>m</SUP>, <SUP>133</SUP>Ba, and <SUP>241</SUP>Am and the Earth Sun distance. We find no evidence for such correlations and set limits on the possible amplitudes of such correlations substantially smaller than those observed in previous experiments., The presence of crystalline silicates in the comae of comets, inferred through infrared observations, has been a long-standing puzzle. Crystalline silicates are unexpected if comets are composed of pristine interstellar material, since interstellar silicates are almost entirely amorphous. Heating to &gt;1100 K can anneal silicates to crystallinity, but no protoplanetary heating sources have been identified that were sufficiently strong to heat materials in the outer nebula to such high temperatures. This conundrum led to the suggestion that large-scale mixing was important in the protoplanetary disk. Reports of refractory calcium-aluminum-rich inclusion-like objects and large concentrations of noble gases in Stardust samples underscore the need for such mixing. However, the evidence from the Stardust samples until now has been largely anecdotal, and it has not been possible to place quantitative constraints on the mixing fraction. Here we report synchrotron-based X-ray microprobe measurements of the relative concentrations of the chemical state of iron in material from a known comet, the Jupiter-family comet 81P/Wild2. We find that the comet is rich in iron sulfides. The elemental S/Fe ratio based on the sulfide concentration, S/Fe &gt;0.31(2σ), is higher than in most chondritic meteorites. We also found that Fe-bearing silicates are at least 50% crystalline. Based on these measurements, we estimate the fraction ψ of inner nebular material in 81P/Wild2. With the lower bound on the crystalline Fe-bearing silicate fraction, we find that ψ&gt;0.5. If the observed S depletion in the inner solar system predated or was contemporaneous with large-scale mixing, our lower bound on the S/Fe ratio gives an upper bound on ψ of ~0.65. This measurement may be used to test mixing models of the early solar system., Following the optical imaging of exoplanet candidate Fomalhaut b (Fom b), we present a numerical model of how Fomalhaut's debris disk is gravitationally shaped by a single interior planet. The model is simple, adaptable to other debris disks, and can be extended to accommodate multiple planets. If Fom b is the dominant perturber of the belt, then to produce the observed disk morphology it must have a mass M <SUB>pl</SUB> &lt; 3M <SUB>J</SUB>, an orbital semimajor axis a <SUB>pl</SUB> &gt; 101.5 AU, and an orbital eccentricity e <SUB>pl</SUB> = 0.11-0.13. These conclusions are independent of Fom b's photometry. To not disrupt the disk, a greater mass for Fom b demands a smaller orbit farther removed from the disk; thus, future astrometric measurement of Fom b's orbit, combined with our model of planet-disk interaction, can be used to determine the mass more precisely. The inner edge of the debris disk at a ≈ 133 AU lies at the periphery of Fom b's chaotic zone, and the mean disk eccentricity of e ≈ 0.11 is secularly forced by the planet, supporting predictions made prior to the discovery of Fom b. However, previous mass constraints based on disk morphology rely on several oversimplifications. We explain why our constraint is more reliable. It is based on a global model of the disk that is not restricted to the planet's chaotic zone boundary. Moreover, we screen disk parent bodies for dynamical stability over the system age of ~ 100 Myr, and model them separately from their dust grain progeny; the latter's orbits are strongly affected by radiation pressure and their lifetimes are limited to ~ 0.1 Myr by destructive grain-grain collisions. The single planet model predicts that planet and disk orbits be apsidally aligned. Fomalhaut b's nominal space velocity does not bear this out, but the astrometric uncertainties may be large. If the apsidal misalignment proves real, our calculated upper mass limit of 3M <SUB>J</SUB> still holds. If the orbits are aligned, our model predicts M <SUB>pl</SUB> = 0.5M <SUB>J</SUB>, a <SUB>pl</SUB> = 115 AU, and e <SUB>pl</SUB> = 0.12. Parent bodies are evacuated from mean-motion resonances with Fom b; these empty resonances are akin to the Kirkwood gaps opened by Jupiter. The belt contains at least 3M <SUB>⊕</SUB> of solids that are grinding down to dust, their velocity dispersions stirred so strongly by Fom b that collisions are destructive. Such a large mass in solids is consistent with Fom b having formed in situ., Photoionization heating from ultraviolet (UV) radiation incidents on the atmospheres of hot Jupiters may drive planetary mass loss. Observations of stellar Lyman-α (Lyα) absorption have suggested that the hot Jupiter HD 209458b is losing atomic hydrogen. We construct a model of escape that includes realistic heating and cooling, ionization balance, tidal gravity, and pressure confinement by the host star wind. We show that mass loss takes the form of a hydrodynamic (Parker) wind, emitted from the planet's dayside during lulls in the stellar wind. When dayside winds are suppressed by the confining action of the stellar wind, nightside winds might pick up if there is sufficient horizontal transport of heat. A hot Jupiter loses mass at maximum rates of ~2 × 10<SUP>12</SUP> g s<SUP>-1</SUP> during its host star's pre-main-sequence phase and ~2 × 10<SUP>10</SUP> g s<SUP>-1</SUP> during the star's main-sequence lifetime, for total maximum losses of ~0.06% and ~0.6% of the planet's mass, respectively. For UV fluxes F <SUB>UV</SUB> lsim 10<SUP>4</SUP> erg cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP>, the mass-loss rate is approximately energy limited and scales as \dot{M} ∝ F_UV^{0.9}. For larger UV fluxes, such as those typical of T Tauri stars, radiative losses and plasma recombination force \dot{M} to increase more slowly as F <SUP>0.6</SUP> <SUB>UV</SUB>. Dayside winds are quenched during the T Tauri phase because of confinement by overwhelming stellar wind pressure. During this early stage, nightside winds can still blow if the planet resides outside the stellar Alfvén radius; otherwise, even nightside winds are stifled by stellar magnetic pressure, and mass loss is restricted to polar regions. We conclude that while UV radiation can indeed drive winds from hot Jupiters, such winds cannot significantly alter planetary masses during any evolutionary stage. They can, however, produce observable signatures. Candidates for explaining why the Lyman-α photons of HD 209458 are absorbed at Doppler-shifted velocities of ±100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> include charge-exchange in the shock between the planetary and stellar winds., The Earth’s magnetotail is an extremely complex system which—energized by the solar wind—displays many phenomena, and Alfvén waves are essential to its dynamics. While Alfvén waves were first predicted in the early 1940’s and ample observations were later made with rockets and low-altitude satellites, observational evidence of Alfvén waves in different regions of the extended magnetotail has been sparse until the beginning of the new millennium. Here I provide a phenomenological overview of Alfvén waves in the magnetotail organized by region—plasmasphere, central plasma sheet, plasma sheet boundary layer, tail lobes, and reconnection region—with an emphasis on spacecraft observations reported in the new millennium that have advanced our understanding concerning the roles of Alfvén waves in the dynamics of the magnetotail. A brief discussion of the coupling of magnetotail Alfvén waves and the low-altitude auroral zone is also included., Using simultaneous observations of the Hα and Ca II K lines for a sample of M3 dwarfs, we investigate the temperature structure required to produce the spectral signatures of chromospheric activity in low mass stars. Combined, the Hα and Ca II K data provide a rich set of observational challenges to theory. We apply these data as empirical constraints for new static models of quiescent M dwarf atmospheres. Using these models, we find that single component model atmospheres are able to provide a satisfactory description of weakly active M dwarfs, but more active stars require two component models, with different temperature structures for active and basal regions of the chromosphere., We present an unbiased census of deeply embedded protostars in Perseus, Serpens, and Ophiuchus, assembled by combining large-scale 1.1 mm Bolocam continuum and Spitzer Legacy surveys. We identify protostellar candidates based on their mid-infrared (mid-IR) properties, correlate their positions with 1.1 mm core positions from Enoch et al. in 2006 and 2007, and Young et al. in 2006, and construct well-sampled spectral energy distributions using our extensive wavelength coverage (λ = 1.25-1100 μm). Source classification based on the bolometric temperature yields a total of 39 Class 0 and 89 Class I sources in the three-cloud sample. We compare to protostellar evolutionary models using the bolometric temperature-luminosity diagram, finding a population of low-luminosity Class I sources that are inconsistent with constant or monotonically decreasing mass accretion rates. This result argues strongly for episodic accretion during the Class I phase, with more than 50% of sources in a ""sub-Shu"" (dM/dt &lt; 10<SUP>-6</SUP> M <SUB>sun</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) accretion state. Average spectra are compared to protostellar radiative transfer models, which match the observed spectra fairly well in Stage 0, but predict too much near-IR and too little mid-IR flux in Stage I. Finally, the relative number of Class 0 and Class I sources is used to estimate the lifetime of the Class 0 phase; the three-cloud average yields a Class 0 lifetime of 1.7 ± 0.3 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr, ruling out an extremely rapid early accretion phase. Correcting photometry for extinction results in a somewhat shorter lifetime (1.1 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr). In Ophiuchus, however, we find very few Class 0 sources (N <SUB>Class 0</SUB>/N <SUB>Class I</SUB> ~ 0.1-0.2), similar to previous studies of that cloud. The observations suggest a consistent picture of nearly constant average accretion rate through the entire embedded phase, with accretion becoming episodic by at least the Class I stage, and possibly earlier., The young A star Fomalhaut hosts a belt of dusty material with a morphology that implies the presence of a shepherding planet (Kalas et al. 2005). We request time to follow up the discovery of a common proper motion companion to Fomalhaut, which appears to be the predicted exoplanet. The mass of Fomalhaut b is less than three Jupiter masses: a more massive object would disrupt the dust belt and would be hotter than the 400 K effective temperature estimated from the HST/ACS F814W flux. Despite deep imaging with Keck AO, Fomalhaut b is not detected in H. This suggests either an error in the model exoplanet spectra or that reflected starlight contributes to the detected signal in the HST bands. NIRI provides very sensitive imaging at Lp; thus, we propose to observe Fomalhaut b at this wavelength. Preliminary observations in DD time placed a 3-sigma upper limit (60 ÂµJy) just above the predicted flux (50 ÂµJy). This measurement offers the best opportunity to measure the thermal emission from Fomalhaut b, to check the fidelity of the exoplanet model spectra, and to place limits on the fraction of scattered/reflected light at shorter wavelengths., The Swift satellite has revolutionized the study of GRBs by providing unprecedented numbers of accurate real-time localizations. With rapid and automated access to GMOS-S, Gemini has emerged as the cornerstone facility of our group's GRB research efforts. This year, Swift has been joined in orbit by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Telescope with its GeV-photon sensitive LAT detector, which has already detected emission from several events. We aim to measure the redshifts of Fermi bursts so that the detection of ultra-high-energy GRB photons may be used for derivative science such as measuring GRB Lorentz factors and constraining theories of quantum gravity. We also seek to differentiate between high reddening and redshift when GRBs have suppressed optical afterglows. Constraining the number of ""dark"" GRBs at moderate-to-high redshift has important implications for understanding GRBs and for informing the role of future missions (eg. JDEM, LSST). GRB afterglows have proven to be a versatile and unique astrophysical probe in the study of the ISM of distant galaxies, the IGM at z&gt;2, and the end of the reionization epoch. To this end, our proposed semester 2009A ToO program also seeks to uncover a number of damped-Lyman alpha systems as well as improve the (very curious) statistics of strong intervening Mg II absorbers towards GRB sightlines., Last year Smith et al. (2007) reported the discovery of a new equatorial ring nebula, called SBW1, around a blue supergiant seen in the Carina Nebula. It has morphology and physical dimensions almost identical to the ring around SN1987A and it surrounds an early B supergiant that is a virtual twin ofthe progenitor of SN1987A. However, it is more than 20 times closer than SN1987A, and therefore shows the detailed structure of this unusual type of ring nebula in much greater detail, before the star explodes. Resolving the structure in this nebula will inform our understanding of non-spherical mass loss from supernova progenitor stars in general, and will constrain models of SN1987A as its blast wave continues to interact with its circumstellar ring. This proposal aims to obtain mid-IR images and spectroscopy of SBW1 with T-ReCS on Gemini South in order to determine the dust properties in the nebula, such as its physical location, temperature, mass, and composition, for comparison with the dust properties of SN1987A's ring and also with the circumstellar dust properties of other blue supergiants like B[e] stars. These IR data are also needed to understand the relationship between warm dust and the ionized gas structures that will be resolved in our accepted program to obtain WFC3 and STIS data with HST., Our proposal aims to obtain late-time observations of the second most luminous supernova (SN) ever observed, SN 2008es. NIR photometry and optical spectroscopy will allow us to further constrain the properties of the subclass of very luminous SNe (vSNe), while also searching for dust formation and measuring properties of the underluminous host galaxy. We see the detailed physical examination of SN 2008es as the prototype for the analysis of vSNe expected to be discovered by new wide-field synoptic optical surveys coming on line soon (e.g., PTF, Pan-STARRS, SkyMapper). With its large aperture, optical and near-infrared instruments, and queue scheduled observing the Gemini-N telescope is the best way to obtain late time observations of these vSNe at high redshift. The extreme luminosity of these SNe is likely powered via a strong interaction between the SN ejecta and circumstellar material, and recent evidence shows that this interaction may give rise to significant dust formation. Such dust can survive long after the SN, and may be a primary source of dust in the early universe., We request time to continue the successful SMARTS GRB program currently being carried out with the 1.3m SMARTS telescope equipped with the ANDICAM imager. Our request is 8 nights of target of opportunity observing time during semester 2009A. Our primary science goals are: 1) to detect GRB afterglows and analyze their SEDs and temporal behaviors and 2) to search for the supernovae associated with low-redshift GRBs. The 1.3m at CTIO is well- suited for this program because it is equipped with the ANDICAM instrument, a dual-channel optical/IR imager. Our targets of opportunity can be easily accommodated on the telescope because it operates in a queue-based observing mode., A key ingredient of solar-type dynamo action is the interface between the convective and radiative zones, so there has been considerable interest in the workings of dynamos in fully convective objects (lacking radiative zones). These constitute by far the majority of objects with dynamos. In the solar-type case, rotation period and convective overturn time (whose ratio yields the Rossby number) have been implicated in the production levels of ``activity.'' This is measured through coronal or chromospheric emission, or by direct field determinations. Activity can lead to magnetic braking, so the angular momentum history of the object is also connected to it. With the advent of large telescopes, most of the techniques applied to solar-type stars (or good substitutes) have now been applied to low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. We measure atmospheric heating produced by magnetic dissipation primarily through Hα emission, and directly measure magnetic fields in M stars through a molecular Zeeman diagnostic (L dwarfs provide fields through radio flares). Rotation is measured through Doppler broadening, but further progress will require photometric periods. I summarize this work, which has led to a number of interesting conclusions: 1) magnetic fields are produced down to very low masses, with magnetic fields remaining strong and large-scale at least through M dwarfs (and likely L dwarfs) 2) rotation, convection, and activity are still connected in M dwarfs, but not in L dwarfs (where heating and fields are disconnected due to atmospheric neutrality) 3) saturation of both heating and total magnetic flux occurs at similar a Rossby number whether fully convective or not; 4) magnetic braking (implying coronae) is present in M stars, but drops with effective temperature (mass), and dies out (braking times become very long) in L dwarfs; 5) variable magnetic activity extends well into L dwarfs, though at decreasing levels; and 6) there are some oddities which still require explanation., We have conducted a deep ((mu)_g ≲ 24) imaging survey using the WIYN 4-m telescope, the UH 88-inch telescope, and the 2.5m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) to search for giant arcs behind the richest clusters identified in the Gpc^3 volume of the SDSS. By imaging nearly 500 massive clusters, this ongoing survey has uncovered some of the most dramatic examples of gravitational lensing ever discovered, similar to `poster-children' like Abell 1689 and CL0024+1654. We propose to use GMOS on Gemini-North and the Blue Channel Spectrograph on the MMT to determine arc redshifts in these new lenses. When combined with our GMOS data from a similar program in 2008A, this proposal will result in a sample of 60 gravitationally lensed galaxies behind ~ 25 clusters. These arc redshifts pinpoint the mass of dark matter interior to the Einstein radius in the cluster core (R &lt; 200 kpc; comoving). The larger scale (R ~ 1-5 Mpc) weak lensing shear has been measured for more than half of our targets from deep imaging at NOT, WIYN, Subaru, and using archival data from HST. GMOS arc redshifts combined with weak and strong lensing will allow us to measure the density profile of dark matter halos on scales 200 kpc &lt; R &lt; 5 Mpc for the statistical sample of lensing clusters, providing a powerful test of the (Lambda)CDM paradigm., It has been an intense matter of debate whether coronal metric type II bursts are generated by coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven shocks or flare blast waves. Using unprecedented high-cadence observations from STEREO/SECCHI, we investigate the relationship between a metric type II event and a shock driven by the 2007 December 31 CME. The existence of the CME-driven shock is indicated by the remote deflection of coronal structures, which is in good timing with the metric type II burst. The CME speed is about 600 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> when the metric type II burst occurs, much larger than the Alfvén speed of 419-489 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> determined from band splitting of the type II burst. A causal relationship is well established between the metric and decametric-hectometric type II bursts. The shock height-time curve determined from the type II bands is also consistent with the shock propagation obtained from the streamer deflection. These results provide unambiguous evidence that the metric type II burst is caused by the CME-driven shock., I examine the effectiveness of Kozai oscillations in the centres of galaxies and in particular the Galactic Centre (GC) using standard techniques from celestial mechanics. In particular, I study the effects of a stellar bulge potential and general relativity on Kozai oscillations, which are induced by stellar discs. Löckmann et al. recently suggested that Kozai oscillations induced by the two young massive stellar discs in the GC drive the orbits of the young stars to large eccentricity (e ~ 1). If some of these young eccentric stars are in binaries, they would be disrupted near pericentre, leaving one star in a tight orbit around the central supermassive black hole and producing the S-star population. I find that the spherical stellar bulge suppresses Kozai oscillations, when its enclosed mass inside a test body is of the order of the mass in the stellar disc(s). Since the stellar bulge in the GC is much larger than the stellar discs, Kozai oscillations due to the stellar discs are likely suppressed. Whether Kozai oscillations are induced from other non-spherical components to the potential (e.g. a flattened stellar bulge) is yet to be determined., We present spatially resolved near-IR spectroscopic observations of 15 young stars. Using a grism spectrometer behind the Keck interferometer, we obtained an angular resolution of a few milliarcseconds and a spectral resolution of 230, enabling probes of both gas and dust in the inner disks surrounding the target stars. We find that the angular size of the near-IR emission typically increases with wavelength, indicating hot, presumably gaseous material within the dust sublimation radius. Our data also clearly indicate Brγ emission arising from hot hydrogen gas, and suggest the presence of water vapor and carbon monoxide gas in the inner disks of several objects. This gaseous emission is more compact than the dust continuum emission in all cases. We construct simple physical models of the inner disk and fit them to our data to constrain the spatial distribution and temperature of dust and gas emission components., We report on our ongoing efforts to produce a relatively complete set of X-ray emission lines present in the Low Energy Transmission Grating (LETG) spectra of Procyon. In addition to using recently reprocessed HRC-S/LETG spectra of Procyon, we use LETG spectra of Capella, along with recent Electron Bean Ion Trap (EBIT) laboratory data and new Flexible Atomic Code (FAC) calculations to identify the wealth of weaker lines present in the spectrum. Experimental measurements at the EBIT-I and EBIT-II facilities at Livermore of astrophysically abundant elements (Fe VII-Fe X, Lepson et al. 2002, Ar IX- Ar XVI, Lepson et al. 2003, S VII- S XIV, Lepson et al. 2004) and new FAC calculations of Mg and Ne (Gu, 2008 in press) provide an opportunity to identify many of the previously unassigned lines in Procyon (Raassen et al., 2002)., We analyze a series of complex interplanetary events and their solar origins that occurred between 19 and 23 May 2007 using observations by the STEREO and Wind satellites. The analyses demonstrate the new opportunities offered by the STEREO multispacecraft configuration for diagnosing the structure of in situ events and relating them to their solar sources. The investigated period was characterized by two high-speed solar wind streams and magnetic clouds observed in the vicinity of the sector boundary. The observing satellites were separated by a longitudinal distance comparable to the typical radial extent of magnetic clouds at 1 AU (fraction of an AU), and, indeed, clear differences were evident in the records from these spacecraft. Two partial-halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs) were launched from the same active region less than a day apart, the first on 19 May and the second on 20 May 2007. The clear signatures of the magnetic cloud associated with the first CME were observed by STEREO B and Wind while only STEREO A recorded clear signatures of the magnetic cloud associated with the latter CME. Both magnetic clouds appeared to have interacted strongly with the ambient solar wind and the data showed evidence that they were a part of the coronal streamer belt. Wind and STEREO B also recorded a shocklike disturbance propagating inside a magnetic cloud that compressed the field and plasma at the cloud's trailing portion. The results illustrate how distant multisatellite observations can reveal the complex structure of the extension of the coronal streamer into interplanetary space even during the solar activity minimum., Mean-motion resonances (MMRs) are likely to play an important role both during and after the lifetime of a protostellar gas disk. We study the dynamical evolution and stability of planetary systems containing two giant planets on circular orbits near a 2:1 resonance and closer. We find that by having the outer planet migrate inward, the two planets can capture into either the 2:1, 5:3, or 3:2 MMR. We use direct numerical integrations of ~1000 systems in which the planets are initially locked into one of these resonances and allowed to evolve for up to ~10<SUP>7</SUP> yr. We find that the final eccentricity distribution in systems which ultimately become unstable gives a good fit to observed exoplanets. Next, we integrate ~500 two-planet systems in which the outer planet is driven to continuously migrate inward, resonantly capturing the inner planet; the systems are evolved until either instability sets in or the planets reach the star. We find that although the 5:3 resonance rapidly becomes unstable under migration, the 2:1 and 3:2 are very stable. Thus the lack of observed exoplanets in resonances closer than 2:1, if it continues to hold up, may be a primordial signature of the planet formation process., Models that reproduce the observed high-velocity clouds (HVCs) also predict clouds at lower radial velocities that may easily be confused with Galactic disk (|z|&lt; 1 kpc) gas. We describe the first search for these low-velocity halo clouds (LVHCs) using Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) data and the initial data from the Galactic Arecibo L-band Feed Array survey in H I. The technique is based upon the expectation that such clouds should, like HVCs, have very limited infrared (IR) thermal dust emission as compared to their H I column density. We describe our ""displacement-map"" technique for robustly determining the dust-to-gas ratio (DGR) of clouds and the associated errors that take into account the significant scatter in the IR flux from the Galactic disk gas. We find that there exist lower-velocity clouds that have extremely low DGRs, consistent with being in the Galactic halo—candidate LVHCs. We also confirm the lack of dust in many HVCs with the notable exception of complex M, which we consider to be the first detection of dust in HVCs. We do not confirm the previously reported detection of dust in complex C. In addition, we find that most intermediate- and low-velocity clouds that are part of the Galactic disk have a higher 60 μm/100 μm flux ratio than is typically seen in Galactic H I, which is consistent with a previously proposed picture in which fast-moving Galactic clouds have smaller, hotter dust grains., We apply simple optical and SZ (Sunyaev-Zel'dovich) cluster finders to mock galaxy catalogues and SZ flux maps created from dark matter haloes in a (1h<SUP>-1</SUP>Gpc)<SUP>3</SUP> dark matter simulation, at redshifts 0.5 and 0.9. At each redshift, the two catalogues are then combined to assess how well they can improve each other, and compared to several variants of catalogues made using SZ flux and galaxy information simultaneously. We use several different criteria to compare the catalogues, and illustrate some of the tradeoffs which arise in tuning the galaxy cluster finders with respect to these criteria. We detail many of the resulting improvements and issues which arise in comparing and combining these two types of data sets., In 4D general relativity, the angular momentum of a black hole is limited by the Kerr bound. We suggest that in string theory, this bound can be breached and compact black-hole-like objects can spin faster. Near such “superspinars”, the efficiency of energy transfer from the accreting matter to radiation can reach 100%, compared to the maximum efficiency of 42% of the extremal Kerr (or 6% of the Schwarzschild) black hole. Finding such superspinning objects as active galactic nuclei, GBHCs, or sources of gamma ray bursts, could be viewed as experimental support for string theory., We examined the reduction of different size hematite (α-Fe <SUB>2</SUB>O <SUB>3</SUB>) nanoparticles (average diameter of 11, 12, 30, 43, and 99 nm) by the dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria (DIRB), Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, to determine how S. oneidensis MR-1 may utilize these environmentally relevant solid-phase electron acceptors. The surface-area-normalized-bacterial Fe(III) reduction rate for the larger nanoparticles (99 nm) was one order of magnitude higher than the rate observed for the smallest nanoparticles (11 nm). The Fe(III) reduction rates for the 12, 30, and 43 nm nanoparticles fell between these two extremes. Whole-cell TEM images showed that the mode of Fe <SUB>2</SUB>O <SUB>3</SUB> nanoparticle attachment to bacterial cells was different for the aggregated, pseudo-hexagonal/irregular and platey 11, 12, and 99 nm nanoparticles compared to the non-aggregated 30 and 43 nm rhombohedral nanoparticles. Due to differences in aggregation, the 11, 12, and 99 nm nanoparticles exhibited less cell contact and less cell coverage than did the 30 and 43 nm nanoparticles. We hypothesize that S. oneidensis MR-1 employs both indirect and direct mechanisms of electron transfer to Fe(III)-oxide nanoparticles and that the bioreduction mechanisms employed and Fe(III) reduction rates depend on the nanoparticles' aggregation state, size, shape and exposed crystal faces., Autonomous long-term monitoring is an essential capability of wireless sensor networks, and solar energy is a viable means of enabling this capability due to its high power density and wide availability. However, micro-solar power system design is challenging because it must address long-term system behavior under highly variable solar energy and consider a large space of design options. Several micro-solar power systems have been designed and implemented, validating particular points in the whole design space. In this dissertation we develop a practical theory of micro-solar power systems that is materialized in a simulation suite that models component and system behavior over a long time-scale and in an external environment that depends on time, location, weather and local conditions. This simulation provides sufficient accuracy to guide specific design choices in a large design space. This design tool is very different from the many ""macro-solar"" calculators, which model typical behavior of kilowatt systems in the best conditions, rather than detailed behavior of milliwatt systems in the worst conditions. We provide a general architecture of micro-solar power systems, comprising key components and interconnections among the components, and formalize each component in an analytical or empirical model of its behavior. We incorporate these component models and their interconnections in the simulation suite. Our discrete time-event simulation models the daily behavior and the long-term behavior by iteratively evaluating the state of the system in the context of its solar environment and internal loads. To model the variability of solar energy, it provides three solar radiation models depending on the degree of information available: an astronomical model for ideal conditions, an obstructed astronomical model for estimating solar radiation under the presence of shadows and obstructions, and a long-term measurement model for estimating solar radiation under weather variation. Our simulation suite is validated with a concrete design: the HydroWatch node which is a well-engineered climate monitoring node and network with a flexible power subsystem. A HydroWatch node is able to support various specific design points and provides visibility into solar performance in a real application setting. With our simulation suite, micro-solar power systems can be designed in a systematic fashion. Putting the model and empirical vehicle together, the design choices in each component of a micro-solar power system are studied to reach a deployable candidate. The deployment is evaluated by analyzing the effects of different solar profiles across the network. The analysis from the deployment can be used to refine the next system-design iteration., We apply detailed observations of the color-magnitude relation (CMR) with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope to study galaxy evolution in eight clusters at z≈ 1. The early-type red sequence is well defined and elliptical and lenticular galaxies lie on similar CMRs. We analyze CMR parameters—scatter, slope, and zero point—as a function of redshift, galaxy properties and cluster mass. For bright galaxies (M<SUB>B</SUB> &lt; -21 mag), the CMR scatter of the elliptical population in cluster cores is smaller than that of the S0 population, although the two become similar at faint magnitudes (M<SUB>B</SUB> &gt; - 21 mag). While the bright S0 population consistently shows larger scatter than the ellipticals, the scatter of the latter increases in the peripheral cluster regions. If we interpret these results as due to age differences, bright elliptical galaxies in cluster cores are, on average, older than S0 galaxies and peripheral elliptical galaxies (by about 0.5 Gyr, using a simple, single-burst solar metallicity stellar population model). The CMR zero point, slope, and scatter in the (U - B)<SUB> z = 0</SUB> rest-frame show no significant evolution out to redshift z ≈ 1.3 or significant dependence on cluster mass. Two of our clusters display CMR zero points that are redder (by ≈2σ) than the average (U - B)<SUB> z = 0</SUB> of our sample. We also analyze the fraction of morphological early-type and late-type galaxies on the red sequence. We find that, while in the majority of the clusters most (80% to 90%) of the CMR population is composed of early-type galaxies, in the highest-redshift, low-mass cluster of our sample, the CMR late-type/early-type fractions are similar (≈50%), with most of the late-type population composed of galaxies classified as S0/a. This trend is not correlated with the cluster's X-ray luminosity, or with its velocity dispersion, and could be a real evolution with redshift., The new balloon-borne Gamma-Ray Imager/Polarimeter for Solar flares (GRIPS) instrument will provide a near-optimal combination of high-resolution imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetry of solar-flare gamma-ray/hard X-ray emissions from 20 keV to &gt; 10 MeV. GRIPS will address questions relevant to particle acceleration and energy release that have been raised by recent solar flare observations, such as: What causes the spatial separation between energetic electron producing hard X-rays and energetic ions producing gamma-ray lines? How anisotropic are the accelerated electrons, and why do relativistic electron dominate in the corona? How does the composition of accelerated and ambient material vary with space and time, and why? <P />The spectrometer/polarimeter consists of sixteen 3D position-sensitive germanium detectors (3D-GeDs), where each energy deposition is individually recorded. Imaging is accomplished by a single multi-pitch rotating modulator (MPRM) situated 8 meters from the spectrometer to provide excellent image quality and unparalleled angular resolution at gamma-ray energies (12.5 arcsec FWHM), using a similar technique to rotating-modulation-collimator imaging used on missions such as RHESSI but now taking advantage of the position sensitivity of the spectrometer. Polarimetry is accomplished by analyzing the anisotropy of reconstructed Compton scattering in the 3D-GeDs (i.e. as an active scatterer). A balloon platform for this instrument minimizes atmospheric attenuation and accommodates its weight and size, and long-duration balloon flights (LDBFs) from Antarctica allow for month-long uninterrupted observations of the Sun to continuously observe active regions and to maximize the chance of capturing a gamma-ray flare. A continental-US test flight is slated for 2012 with the eventual goal of Antarctic LDBFs of the completed instrument. In addition to the direct science return from these flights, GRIPS will prove these technologies for a future space-based mission., The Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI) is a NASA Low Cost Access to Space sounding rocket payload scheduled to fly in late 2010 to observe hard X-ray emission (HXR) from the quiet Sun. Particle acceleration in small ""nanoflares"" in the quiet Sun is thought to play an important role in the heating of the corona to millions of degrees Kelvin. FOXSI HXR observations of these flares will provide first estimates of the non-thermal energy content in small flares from the quiet Sun. <P />Imaging nanoflares requires high energy sensitivity and a large dynamic range. To date, the most sensitive HXR images are made using a rotating modulating collimator aboard the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Spectroscopic Imager satellite (RHESSI). However, the rotating modulation technique is intrinsically limited in sensitivity and dynamic range. <P />The focusing optics of FOXSI will achieve a sensitivity 100 times better than that of RHESSI at energies around 10 keV. FOXSI uses nested-shell, grazing-angle optics and silicon strip detectors to achieve an angular resolution of 12"" (FWHM) and 1 keV energy resolution. FOXSI will observe the quiet Sun in the 4 to 15 keV range for 5 minutes. The focusing optics technique developed by FOXSI will prove useful to future solar HXR observing missions, especially those interested in imaging faint HXR emission from particle acceleration regions in the corona., We present observations of SCP 06F6, an unusual optical transient discovered during the Hubble Space Telescope Cluster Supernova Survey. The transient brightened over a period of 100 days, reached a peak magnitude of 21.0 in both i_775 and z_850, and then declined over a similar timescale. There is no host galaxy or progenitor star detected at the location of the transient to a 3 sigma upper limit of i_775 = 26.4 and z_850 = 26.1, giving a corresponding lower limit on the flux increase of a factor of 120. Multiple spectra show five broad absorption bands between 4100 angstroms and 6500 angstroms and a mostly featureless continuum longward of 6500 angstroms. The shape of the lightcurve is inconsistent with microlensing. The transient's spectrum, in addition to being inconsistent with all known supernova types, is not matched to any spectrum in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) database. We review possible explanations., The earliest stages of protostellar evolution are notoriously difficult to characterize observationally due to their dense extincting envelopes and the necessity for long wavelength observations, but recent surveys have made great strides in this area. We have assembled a complete sample of 40 Class 0 and 90 Class I sources (with envelope masses &gt; 0.1 Msun) in the Perseus, Serpens, and Ophiuchus molecular clouds using large-scale c2d Spitzer surveys and Bolocam 1.1 mm continuum maps (Enoch, Evans, Sargent &amp; Glenn, 2009, ApJ in press). Such a sample is critical for understanding early protostellar evolution on a statistical level, while also providing fertile ground for more detailed follow-up studies. I will discuss implications for early protostellar evolution based on the c2d/Bolocam sample, including evolutionary timescales and evidence for episodic accretion. I will also show some preliminary results on a follow-up study with the CARMA interferometer to map the mass distribution in close pairs and small groups of candidate embedded protostars., As part of our theoretical investigation of cluster formation, we determine the starting configuration of the Pleiades, i.e., the structure that evolved, through dynamical relaxation, to the present-day one. We used the N-body code Starlab to run simulations of the cluster's evolution following removal of its primordial gas. Starting from a range of initial states, we found the one which, over the known cluster age of 125 Myr, gives the best match to present-day conditions. For the latter, we utilize our own previous statistical analysis of Pleiades photometric observations (Converse &amp; Stahler 2007). <P />We find that the starting configuration had a virial radius of about 4 pc. This figure exceeds the observed radii of embedded clusters with similar populations. In order to reproduce the present-day distribution of stellar masses, the young cluster must already have had substantial mass segregation. These findings suggest that the Pleiades underwent relatively rapid expansion and mass segregation during the final clearing of remnant, molecular gas., The South Pole Telescope (SPT) is an instrument designed to survey galaxy clusters using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. In this thesis I describe the telescope, its first-generation receiver, and its readout and control systems. I also present Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements of 15 massive X-ray selected galaxy clusters obtained with the SPT. The cluster signals are measured at 150 GHz, and concurrent 220 GHz data are used to reduce astrophysical contamination. Radial profiles are computed using a technique that takes into account the effects of the beams and filtering. In several clusters, significant SZ decrements are detected out to a substantial fraction of the virial radius. The profiles are fit to the beta-model and to a generalized NFW pressure profile, and are scaled and stacked to probe their average behavior. The best-fit model parameters are consistent with previous studies: beta = 0.86 and rcore/r500 = 0.20 for the beta-model, and (alphan, betan, gamman, c500)=(1.0, 5.5, 0.5, 1.0) for the generalized NFW model. Both models fit the SPT data comparably well, and both are consistent with the average SZ profile out to the virial radius. The integrated Compton-y parameter YSZ is computed for each cluster using both model-dependent and model-independent techniques, and the results are compared to X-ray estimates of cluster parameters. YSZ is found to scale with YX and gas mass with low scatter. Since these observables have been found to scale with total mass, these results point to a tight mass-observable relation for the SPT cluster survey., The Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) is a low-frequency interferometer being developed to detect cosmic reionization via fluctuations in the brightness temperature of the 21cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen in the early intergalactic medium. Interfering with the direct detection of a global reionization signature are a myriad of astrophysical foregrounds, including polarized galactic synchrotron emission, continuum point-sources, and galactic/extra-galactic free-free emission. Suppression of these foregrounds will require extraordinary calibration and high dynamic-range imaging, as well as large numbers of antennas to achieve the necessary sensitivity in the region of the power spectrum where the reionization signal peaks relative to them. <P />Addressing the challenge of correlating large numbers of antennas, we have developed a flexible correlator architecture that scales to hundreds of antennas. This correlator is based on Field-Programmable Gate Array processors connected by a 10 Gb Ethernet switch, and programmed using a parameterized signal processing library. We demonstrate how this work has dramatically decreased correlator development time, and has enabled PAPER to grow as a series of deployments of increasing size. <P />Calibration and high dynamic-range imaging with low-frequency interferometers are exacerbated by wide bandwidths and large fields-of-view (FoV). To simplify the calibration process when an interferometer consistently has many strong sources simultaneously in its FoV, we present a fringe-rate/delay filtering technique to isolating source fluxes. This is implemented as part of Astronomical Interferometry in PYthon (AIPY), a new open-source software toolkit that facilitates exploration and algorithm development by modularizing data processing and visibility simulation. We present the application of this toolkit to various aspects of PAPER calibration. <P />Finally, we present the first all-sky map and point source catalog derived from 100-200MHz observations by 4, 8, and 16 antenna PAPER deployments in Green Bank, WV, and in western Australia., , Observations of the Galactic Anticenter region and atmospheric 511 keV positron annihilation emission have been performed with a prototype of the Nuclear Compton Telescope (NCT) during a high altitude balloon flight on June 1, 2005 from Ft. Sumner, NM. NCT is a balloon-borne soft gamma-ray (0.2 MeV to 10 MeV) germanium Compton telescope (GCT) designed to study astrophysical sources of nuclear line emission and polarization through spectroscopy and imaging. A prototype instrument was successfully launched from Ft. Sumner, NM on June 1, 2005. The NCT prototype consists of two 3D position-sensitive high purity germanium strip detectors (GeDs). The compact design and new technologies allow NCT to achieve high efficiencies with excellent spectral resolution and background reduction. The GeDs are custom 15 mm thick cross-strip detectors each with an active area of 54 cm 2 and are enclosed in an aluminum cryostat capable of supporting up to 12 detectors. Here is presented a detailed study of approximately 8 hours of background measurements made from 890 g/cm 2 (1265 m ) to an average float altitude of 3.0 g/cm 2 (40 km ), with particular emphasis on float observations. A total of 6 hr 9 min of observation time was acquired at float, while the duration of the ascent portion of the flight included in this study was 2 hr. <P />The expected contributions to the background are discussed, especially in light of detailed Monte Carlo simulations modeling the entire flight and incorporating complete depth dependent environmental inputs, including 4 cosmic components (protons, photons, electrons, and positrons) and 8 atmospheric components (photons, atmospheric 511 keV emission, neutrons, protons, electrons, positrons, and muons). The results of these investigations include the component makeup of the total background as a function of atmospheric depth, and the contribution of delayed emission due to neutron and proton activation of passive materials. At 1 MeV photons emitted following delayed neutron induced reactions comprise ~ 15% of the total background at small depths. The observed background due to this component is a result of Compton scattering of 1.779 MeV ( 29 Al, t 1/2 = 2.24 min ) photons out of the instrument following neutron capture by 28 Al nuclei. The sources of these photons are the substantial amount of aluminum materials surrounding the instrument. <P />Studies of nuclear line emission require accurate energy calibrations. The NCT prototype consists of two 3D position-sensitive GeDs with 2 × 37 × 37 orthogonal strips for energy measurements. Each strip requires a unique energy calibration. For the electrodes under high voltage (-800 V ) the collected charge is dependent on interaction depth, with charge losses in transit presumably due to trapping and/or recombination. The measured electron trapping lengths for the two GeDs are 1264 cm and 930.3 cm , and the measured hole trapping lengths are 1149.2 cm and 847.3 cm , respectively. The total energy loss at 662 keV approaches 0.1%. Additional losses of up to 0.4% occur at the detector surfaces containing the low voltage electrodes. <P />The positron annihilation line has been observed as a function of atmospheric depth. Simulations suggest contributions to this line from b + -decay and pair production in passive materials are negligible at all depths, and that the line fraction due to positron annihilation in passive materials varies approximately linearly with depth: at large depths (&gt; 700 g cm -2 ) the fraction is &gt; 50% and for depths &lt; 5 g cm -2 the contribution is less than 0.3%. A major result of these studies is that essentially all of the 511 keV line measurements at float are due to atmospheric emissions. At an average float altitude of 2.9 g cm - 2 the vertical atmospheric annihilation line flux measured by the prototype Nuclear Compton Telescope is 3.5 × 10^-2 ( cm 2 s sr keV ) -1 . Images of 511 keV emission at float altitudes are presented. <P />The Galactic Anticenter Region was observed in nine continuum energy bands from 100 keV to 1.5 MeV. Received fluxes from the Crab Nebula are at the sensitivity threshold of the NCT prototype for this flight. 3 s upper limits for the 100- 200, 150-450, 200-600, 250-750, 300-900, 350-1050, 400-1200, 450-1350, and 500- 1500 keV bands are 8.9, 4.9, 3.2, 5.3, 3.1, 4.0, 3.8, 4.7, and 4.7 × 10^-2 cm - 2 s -1 , respectively., The Sun can produce ions with energies up to tens of GeV and electrons up to hundreds of MeV, in both large solar flares and fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and is a useful laboratory to investigate the processes of impulsive energy release and particle acceleration that occur throughout the universe. Solar flares are the most powerful explosions in the solar system, releasing up to 1032-1033 ergs of stored magnetic energy in 100-1,000 seconds, with up to ∼10-50% of this energy going into accelerated electrons and a comparable amount into accelerated &gt;∼1 MeV ions. Flare-accelerated particles are observed through the various types of emission produced as they interact with the ambient solar atmosphere energetic ions produce gamma-ray lines through a variety of processes, while energetic electrons produce bremsstrahlung continuum emission. Gamma-ray observations from the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) probe solar-flare ion acceleration and can compare it to electron acceleration. For RHESSI events, there is a tight linear correlation between ion-associated and electron-associated emissions, implying that the relative acceleration of ions above 30 MeV and electrons above 0.3 MeV is roughly independent of flare size, which provides constraints for acceleration models. This correlation does not hold for all flares at lower electron energies, with some flares exhibiting a relative excess of low-energy electron bremsstrahlung. Also, the ratios of accelerated ions and electrons in flares is comparable to ratios in impulsive solar energetic particle (SEP) events, but much larger than ratios in gradual SEP events. RHESSI gamma-ray observations of the temporal variability of gamma-ray lines suggest the possibility of intriguing changes in the ambient environment (e.g., abundances) as a flare progresses. Finally, open questions about solar-flare ion acceleration will be studied by a new balloon-borne instrument, the Gamma-Ray Imager/Polarimeter for Solar flares (GRIPS), which is being developed at the University of California, Berkeley. GRIPS will use new detector and imaging technologies to produce gamma-ray images at an unprecedented angular resolution and measure gamma-ray polarization, and will prove these technologies for future space-based missions., This thesis describes the development, design, instrument performance and observations of the APEX-SZ receiver. APEX-SZ is a millimeter-wave cryogenic receiver designed to observe galaxy clusters via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect from the 12 m APEX telescope on the Atacama plateau in Chile. The receiver consists of a focal plane of 280 superconducting transition edge sensor (TES) bolometers cooled to 280 mK via a three stage He sorption fridge and mechanical pulse tube cooler. The detectors are instrumented with a frequency-domain multiplexed readout system. A horn array, 4 K lenses and tertiary mirrors couple the TES bolometers to the telescope. APEX-SZ observes in a single frequency band at 150 GHz with 59"" angular resolution and a 22' field-of-view, well suited for cluster mapping. The receiver represents a leap forward in millimeter wave detector technology. Initial observations with APEX-SZ were early demonstrations of a fielded imaging TES array, frequency multiplexed readout and cryocooled bolometer receiver. These technologies have already been applied to receivers with thousands of detectors. APEX-SZ typically observes with 180 optically active detectors with an optical efficiency of 0.33 and median NET per channel of 860 muKCMB s . The per channel sensitivity is limited by a bandwidth 40% narrower than expected, and cavity absorption efficiency of 0.74. New detector wafers with wider bandwidth have been fabricated and tested at the telescope on a limited run last spring. With improved bandwidth and lower thermal conductivity, newly fabricated wafers can achieve background noise limited performance. We plan to upgrade the focal plane with a full array of new wafers in December 2009. The receiver has successfully completed 9 weeks of science observation since its installation in April 2007. We have made over a dozen SZE maps from targeted observations of known clusters. We present SZE temperature maps of the Bullet cluster (1E 0657--56) and Abell 2163., When did the Galaxy's stars form? I address this question by investigating the enrichment history of the r-process elements, which form in core-collapse supernovae. I begin by establishing a method by which I measure the abundance of europium, which is almost entirely generated in the r-process, in solar neighborhood stars. The least-squares fitting technique matches LTE synthetic spectra with observed spectra. I demonstrate the technique's accuracy by comparing my results with literature values for 41 stars. I then apply my technique to a full complement of 1070 stars in the solar neighborhood, the largest catalog of europium abundances compiled to date. Comparing my europium results with other properties of those stars, I investigate europium's correlation with a number of qualities, most notably stellar age. I conclude that europium abundance versus time is constant, rising only 0.06 dex over the past 10 Gyr, with an RMS scatter of ∼0.2 dex during that time. Europium abundance and iron abundance are strongly correlated: star forming regions that were significantly enriched by iron-producing supernovae were also significantly enriched by r-process-producing supernovae. Further, the two types of supernovae do not detonate in a constant proportion over the Galaxy's history. In comparing europium abundance with extrasolar planet occurrence, systems with planets have more europium, given their iron abundance, than systems without planets. While europium itself is not abundant enough to influence planet formation directly, it is possible that other elements produced in the same supernovae, e.g., oxygen, do play some role in planet formation. One limitation of field stars in determining the Galaxy's enrichment history is the uncertainty in their ages. To address this issue, I also measure europium abundances in 64 stars within nine open clusters. The result that europium levels have been constant over the past 8-10 Gyr persists. I also announce the existence of two Jovian-mass extrasolar planets orbiting intermediate mass stars in eccentric orbits. Intermediate mass stars are difficult targets for radial velocity planet searches, so these new planets fill out our understanding of the mass distribution of exoplanet hosts., Berkeley SuperNova Ia Program (BSNIP) has been observing nearby (z &lt; 0.1) Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) both photometrically and spectroscopically for two decades. Using telescopes at both Lick and Keck Observatories, we have amassed an extensive collection of well-sampled optical light curves with complementary spectra covering, on average, 3400-10,000 Å. About 70% of the objects for which we have light curves were discovered (and often followed photometrically) using the 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT) at Lick Observatory. In addition, about 40% of the SNe for which we only have spectra and about 72% of the SNe for which we have both photometry and spectroscopy were discovered by KAIT. <P />Through 2006, we have obtained nearly 600 spectra of more than 200 SNe Ia with light-curve information. We also have densely sampled multi-color light curves of 118 SNe Ia and unfiltered light curves of at least 185 other SNe Ia. This sample represents a &gt;50% increase in the number of published low-z SN Ia spectra and will triple the current sample of published low-z SN Ia light curves. Moreover our entire set of well over 1000 spectra representing more than 400 different SNe Ia will not only double the number of published low-z SNe Ia spectra, but will also quadruple the number of low-z SNe Ia that have published spectra. Its sheer size, along with the uniform nature of the observations and data reduction, set this dataset apart from any other SN Ia dataset published thus far. <P />Here we present some of the data obtained between 1986 and 2006, as well as a summary of the contents of the entire dataset. Initial analysis, along with the entire dataset itself, will be published in the coming year. <P />We gratefully acknowledge the financial support of NSF grant AST-0607485 and the TABASGO Foundation., Control of systematic uncertainties in the use of type Ia supernovae as standardized distance indicators can be achieved through contrasting subsets of observationally characterized, like supernovae. Essentially, like supernovae at different redshifts reveal the cosmology, and differing supernovae at the same redshift reveal systematics, including evolution not already corrected for by the standardization. Here we examine the strategy for use of empirically defined subsets to minimize the cosmological parameter risk, the quadratic sum of the parameter uncertainty and systematic bias. We investigate the optimal recognition of subsets within the sample and discuss some issues of observational requirements on accurately measuring subset properties. Neglecting like vs like comparison (i.e. creating only a single Hubble diagram) can cause cosmological constraints on dark energy to be biased by 1σ or degraded by a factor of 1.6 for a total drift of 0.02 mag. Recognition of subsets at the 0.016 mag level (relative differences) erases bias and reduces the degradation to 2%., We present broadband (radio - X-ray) observations of the long-duration gamma-ray bursts GRB050525A and GRB060418. Using our multi-parameter fitting software, we model the afterglows to extract constraints on the energetics, geometry, and environments of both events. Like many Swift bursts, we find little evidence for any achromatic jet break from either event to late times. The energetic implications of such widely beamed explosions would be profound, with total energy release in excess of 10e52 erg. We discuss the implications of this emerging class of hyper-energetic Swift GRBs, and the possibility of detecting such events in the future with Large Area Telescope on board Fermi., The first gamma-ray burst (GRB) confirmed to be bright enough to be seen with the naked eye, GRB 080319B at redshift z = 0.937, allowed for exquisite follow-up observations across the electromagnetic spectrum. We present our detailed optical and infrared (IR) observations of the afterglow, consisting of over 5000 images starting 51 s after the GRB trigger, in concert with our own analysis of the Swift UVOT, Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), and XRT data. The event is extreme not only in observed properties but also intrinsically: it was the most luminous event ever recorded at optical and IR wavelengths and had an exceedingly high isotropic-equivalent energy release in γ-rays. At early times, the afterglow evolution is broadly consistent with being reverse-shock dominated, but then is subsumed by a forward shock at around 1000 s. The overall spectral energy distribution, spanning from ultraviolet through near-IR wavelengths, shows no evidence for a significant amount of dust extinction in the host frame. The afterglow evolution, however, is highly chromatic: starting at about 1000 s the index shifts blueward before shifting back to the red at late times. In our deepest late-time observations, we find tentative evidence for an optical jet break and a luminous supernova. Finally, we examine the detectability of such events with current and future facilities and find that such an event could be detected in gamma rays by BAT out to z = 10.7 (8σ), while the nominal EXIST sensitivity would allow detection to z ≈ 32. At the K band, this source would have been easily detected with meter-class telescopes to z ≈ 17., We describe a program to reduce systematic uncertainties in cosmological measurements using type Ia supernovae (SNe) at z&gt;1. By studying the progenitor environments for cluster-hosted SNe, we can decouple intrinsic color from dust and also establish progenitor age and metallicity as an indicator of population evolution. We present color-magnitude diagrams of 25 high redshift (0.9&lt;z&lt;1.5) galaxy clusters constructed from over 200 orbits of deep HST ACS imaging in the i_775 and z_850 filters. We also present six z&gt;1; SNe Ia hosted by galaxies on tightly dispersed red-sequences constraining the presence dust. We have spectroscopically confirmed over 160 cluster members using Keck, Subaru and VLT spectra. By classifying spectra on the presence or absence of emission lines we have identified cuts in morphology that enable us to select emission line free passively evolving galaxies in the ACS z_850 images. We place constraints on cluster ages and metallicities by comparing stacked spectra against stellar population synthesis models. We conclude that the hosts of the aforementioned SNe are spectroscopically, photometrically and morphologically consistent with passively evolving galaxies. This subsample of minimally extincted SNe Ia thus provides a well-characterized candle with which to test cosmological models., The Sun is capable of accelerating ions from ~ tens of keV up to tens of GeV and electrons from ~ tens of eV up to hundreds of MeVs in transient events such as flares and fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The energized particles escaping into the interplanetary medium are referred to as Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events. The great majority of SEP events are impulsive SEP events that are dominated by ~1-100 keV electrons and ~MeV/nucleon ion emissions, with enhanced 3 He/ 4 He ratios up to 10 4 times the coronal values (also called electron/ 3 He-rich SEP events). This thesis is focused on solar impulsive energetic electron events, the electron part of impulsive SEP events, using electron observations from the 3-D Plasma and Energetic Particle instrument (3DP) on the WIND spacecraft near the Earth. <P />First, I present the first comprehensive statistical study of solar energetic electron events over almost one solar cycle. I find that the occurrence rate of solar electron events shows a strong solar-cycle variation; after correction for the background effect, the estimated occurrence frequency exhibits a good power-law distribution, and the estimated occurrence rate near the Earth is ~1000/year at solar maximum and ~30/year at solar minimum for the instrumental sensitivity (~2.9×10^-4 (cm 2 s str eV) -1 for the 40 keV channel) of WIND/3DP, about one order of magnitude larger than the observed occurrence rate. Solar energetic electron events have a one-to-one association with type III radio bursts and a poor association with flares, but a close association with 3 He- rich ion emissions. These 3 He-rich electron events also have a poor association with flares but a close (~ 60%) association with west-limb CMEs. <P />Then I present two case studies: one investigating the temporal relationship between solar impulsive electrons and type III radio emissions, and the second studying the temporal relationship between solar impulsive electrons and 3 He- rich ions. For both studies, I chose nearly scatter-free electron events and developed a forward-fitting method that assumes an isosceles triangular injection profile (equal rise and fall times) at the Sun. I find that in electron/3He-rich SEP events, the low-energy (~0.4 to 6-9 keV) electron injection starts ~9 min before the coronal release of the type III radio burst; the high-energy (~13 to ~300 keV) electron injection starts ~8 min after the type III burst; and the injection of ~MeV/nucleon, 3 He-rich ions begins ~1 hour later. I also find that the selected electron/ 3 He-rich SEP events have a remarkable one-to-one association with fast west-limb CMEs, and most of the associated CMEs are narrow. <P />Finally, I present a case study to investigate the propagation of different energy electrons in solar impulsive electron events. I find that in the interplanetary medium, low-energy (&lt;~ 10-30 keV) and high-energy (&gt;~ 10-30 keV) electrons propagate differently, with more scattering at high energies. Such scattering appears to be caused by resonance with waves/turbulence at scale greater than ~ the thermal proton gyroradius in the solar wind. Although a transition to more scattering occurs at energies where the electron injection delays are detected, I show that the scattering is not enough to produce these delays. <P />Based on the results of this thesis, a coherent picture of electron/ 3 He-rich SEP events can be built up. At the Sun, the low-energy (~0.4 to 6-9 keV) electrons may be accelerated in jets that are ejected upward from magnetic reconnection sites between closed and open field lines; these low-energy electrons generate the type III radio bursts. The jets may appear as CMEs high in the corona, and the high-energy (~13 to ~300 keV) electrons may then be accelerated at &gt;~ 1 R S by CMEs, acting on the seed electrons provided by the low-energy injection. The ~MeV/nucleon, 3 He-rich ions may be accelerated by selective resonance with electron-beam generated waves and/or by fast, narrow CMEs. In the interplanetary medium, both low and high energy electrons often propagate nearly scatter-free, but the high-energy electrons experience more scattering than the low-energy electrons, likely by waves/turbulence generated by solar wind ions. In the future, the upcoming missions to visit the inner heliosphere within ~0.2 AU (Solar Orbiter) or ~10 R S (Solar Probe Plus) will provide the near-Sun measurements to improve our understanding of SEP events., Using the POLISH instrument, I am unable to reproduce the observations of Berdyugina et al. (2008), who claim to have detected polarized, scattered light off the atmosphere of the HD 189733b hot Jupiter. The amplitude of this signal is reported to be two parts in 10^4, which is larger than twice the amplitude expected for a perfectly diffusing, Lambertian planet. However, Lucas et al. (2008) find the polarimetric modulation of tau Boo to be inconsistent with a planetary origin, and any such planetary signal cannot be present at larger than 15% of the amplitude expected for a Lambertian sphere. I achieve photon shot noise limited, polarimetric precision of 2.4 x 10^(-5) each night, while the precision in eight-night phase bins from Berdyugina et al. (2008) is 6 x 10^(-5). Thus, my observations would have isolated the phase-locked component of the reported modulation with a signal to noise ratio of about eight. My non-detection shows that the polarimetric modulation observed by this group is not stable and cannot therefore be due to the planet. Starspots filling 1% of the stellar disk are known to exist on the active HD 189733 (Hebrard &amp; Lecavelier des Etangs 2006, Croll et al. 2007, Pont et al. 2007, Winn et al. 2007), and they are most likely the cause of the signal detected by Berdyugina et al. (2008). Such planet-sized starspots viewed on the stellar limb may generate stellar polarization of order one part in 10^4 to 10^5 (Carciofi &amp; Magalhaes 2005), which is comparable in amplitude and orbital phase to the reported modulation. Planet-induced starspots are observed on tau Boo in photometry with the MOST satellite (Walker et al. 2008), and there is some evidence that the planet orbiting HD 189733 also induces activity on its host star (Shkolnik et al. 2008)., Repeating earthquakes (REs) are sequences of events that have virtually identical waveforms and are interpreted to represent fault asperities driven to failure by loading from aseismic creep on the surrounding fault surface at depth. To investigate the postseismic deformation after the 1984 M6.2 Morgan Hill earthquake, we identify RE sequences occurring on the central Calaveras fault between 1984 and 2005 using a combination of cross-correlation and spectral coherence techniques. Both the accelerated slip transients due to the earthquake as well as the return to interseismic background creep rates can be imaged from our dataset. A comparison between the regions of the fault that ruptured coseismically and the locations of the REs show that REs preferentially occur in areas adjacent to the coseismic rupture. Using calculated RE-derived subsurface slip distributions at 6 months and 18 months after the mainshock, we predict surface electronic distance meter (EDM) line length changes between stations near the Morgan Hill rupture area. The RE-derived slip model underpredicts a subset of the observed line-length changes. Inclusion of transient aseismic slip below the seismogenic zone is needed to better match the measured surface deformation., The SN Ia cosmology approach hinges upon the ability to meaningfully compare the brightnesses of high redshift SNe to those at low redshift to derive accurate distances. This necessitates a deeper physical understanding of SNe Ia, especially the effects of progenitor age and metallicity whose distributions evolve with redshift. These progenitor properties are predicted to have significant impact on the properties of the resultant SN, making it important to examine the parent stellar populations of a well-studied sample of SNe Ia to investigate these effects. We will present the metallicity and star-formation activity of a sample of over 100 host galaxies from the Nearby Supernova Factory set of SNe Ia. With absolute magnitudes spanning the range -15 to -24 (SDSS i-band) and star-formation rates as high as 30 solar masses per year, this wide range of host properties is expected to encompass all SN Ia environments of significance for current and planned cosmological supernova surveys., We have built the APEX-SZ instrument to observe galaxy clusters with the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect (SZE), in which Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons are scattered off of the hot electron gas within a galaxy cluster. Galaxy clusters are the largest collapsed objects in the universe and make excellent tracers of the distribution and evolution of matter. Galaxy cluster surveys can be used to measure the matter density of the universe O m , the equation of state of dark energy w, the amplitude of matter fluctuations at 8 h -1 Mpc s 8 , and the Hubble constant H 0 . Galaxy cluster observations with the SZE also provide a unique probe of galaxy cluster physics. <P />I will describe the design and fabrication of the 330-element Transition-Edge Sensor (TES) bolometer array used in APEX-SZ. CMB power is measured with an aluminum-titanium bilayer TES centered on a silicon-nitride spiderweb covered with a thin-film gold absorber. Frequency-domain multiplexing is used to read out the TESs. An integration cavity is formed behind a smooth-walled conical horn by the silicon wafer in direct contact with a metal backshort. This cavity couples the gold absorber to incoming millimeter-wave radiation. I will also describe finite element analysis electromagnetic simulations of the integration cavity intended to optimize the optical efficiency of the bolometer array. <P />The full configuration APEX-SZ instrument was deployed to the 12-meter diameter APEX telescope sited in Chile in March 2007. Observations of the Bullet cluster, a massive galaxy cluster merger perpendicular to the line-of-sight, were made in August 2007. The Bullet cluster was detected in the SZE with a23s significance within the central 1' radius of the source position. We measure a temperature decrement of --880 ± 80mK CMB using an isothermal elliptical b- model fit to the temperature map. We measure a cluster gas mass fraction fg = 0.121±0.038 within a radius 1.42 Mpc, consistent with X-ray and weak lensing results. This work represents the first scientific result from a large array of multiplexed TES bolometers., The first hypervelocity stars, bodies with radial velocities greater than the escape speed of the Milky Way, have previously been observed only in the halo of our Galaxy. However, they are thought to originate near the Galactic center. We present the most extensive search to date for hypervelocity stars in this region. Our images were taken over a one year baseline with the W. M. Keck II 10 m telescope using laser guide star adaptive optics techniques to achieve diffraction-limited resolution in this very crowded field. Two candidates appear to be unbound to the Galactic center; to confirm their velocities, we will need to verify that they reside at the Galactic center, about 8 kpc from Earth. In addition, our analysis revealed that the optical distortion of our camera, OSIRIS, changed significantly between 2007 and 2008. We were able to correct for this effect for the purposes of this project, but would like to trace the distortion over a longer period of time in order to determine whether the change was due to a one-time disturbance or whether the OSIRIS distortion continuously changes with time., In this dissertation, I use observations of the Small Magellanic Cloud with the Spitzer Space Telescope to study the life-cycle of interstellar dust in a low-metallicity environment. Dust is a crucial ingredient of the interstellar medium (ISM). Among its many roles are regulating thermal and charge balance, shielding molecular clouds from dissociating ultraviolet radiation and providing surface area for chemical reactions such as the formation of molecular hydrogen. The content and characteristics of dust in a galaxy are determined by the balance between its formation and destruction and by the processing that dust undergoes in the ISM. In a low-metallicity environment, these processes are different from what we observe in the Milky Way, leading to a lower abundance of dust and a change in its size distribution and composition. Since we aim to understand star-formation over the history of the Universe, much of which occurred in a lower metallicity environment than currently exists in the Milky Way, we must look elsewhere to understand the life-cycle of dust in more primordial conditions. The SMC is an ideal location for such an endeavor since it has a low metallicity and its proximity allows us to map the emission from dust at high spatial resolution and sensitivity. In Chapter 2, I study the mid-infrared emission from a young core-collapse supernova remnant in the SMC. The amount and composition of dust produced by core-collapse supernovae is a major unknown in understanding the life-cycle of dust. I use spectral mapping observations from the Spitzer Spectroscopic Survey of the SMC (S4MC) to constrain the mass and composition of dust formed in the ejecta of the supernova. This work shows that only ∼ 10-3 M⊙ of amorphous carbon and ∼ 10-5 M⊙ of forsterite have formed in the remnant, far less than the amount necessary to make core-collapse supernovae an important source of dust in the early Universe. I also present evidence that the reverse shock in the remnant has altered the initial size distribution of the newly-formed dust grains and may decrease the total amount of dust the supernova finally adds to the ISM. Chapters 3 and 4 concern the life-cycle of an important component of interstellar dust: polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Thought to be the carrier of the bright mid-IR emission bands that can radiate ∼ 10% of a galaxy's infrared power, PAHs are also a dominant source of photoelectric heating in the ISM. Observations have shown that low-metallicity galaxies are deficient in PAHs. In Chapter 3, I use photometry from the Spitzer Survey of the SMC (S3MC) and spectroscopy from S4MC along with the dust models of Draine &amp; Li (2007) to study the distribution and abundance of PAHs in the SMC. Then, in Chapter 3, I use the ratios of the mid-IR bands observed with S4MC to constrain the physical state (i.e. ionization, size distribution and structure) of the PAHs. I show that the PAH deficiency in the SMC is primarily due to the destruction of PAHs in the diffuse ISM. I also show that along lines of sight through molecular gas, the PAH abundance in the SMC is comparable to what is observed in the Milky Way, suggesting that the formation of PAHs in dense clouds rather than asymptotic giant branch stars may be the dominant source of PAHs in this galaxy. The relative strengths of the mid-IR emission bands in star-forming regions suggest that SMC PAHs are smaller and less ionized their counterparts in higher metallicity galaxies. Finally, I discuss the implications of these observations for our understanding of PAHs in low-metallicity environments., I will present constraints on cosmological parameters from a combination of cluster mass to galaxy number ratios combined with halo occupation analysis of the galaxy autocorrelation function. In two-point clustering, cosmology an bias are degenerate; good fits to the correlation function can be obtained for a wide variety of comologies. However, in order to match the observed level of clustering, each cosmology predicts a different number of galaxies per unit mass at the cluster mass scale. A combination of DR7 galaxy clustering results and M/N data from the weak lensing analysis of the maxBCG catalog break the degeneracy between cosmology and bias, leading to constraints on \Omega_m and \sigma_8 that are competitive with current CMB results., The rapid variability and large energies that characterize Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) strongly implicate neutron stars or stellar-mass black holes as their central engines. In this thesis, I develop theoretical models of both accretion powered and spin-down-powered central engines and apply them to long- and short-duration GRBs. This research covers several topics, including: (1) The effects of strong magnetic fields and rapid rotation on winds from newly-formed neutron stars (NSs). I describe the evolution of the wind through the Kelvin- Helmholtz cooling epoch of the NS, emphasizing the transition between (i) thermal neutrino-driven, (ii) non-relativistic magnetically-dominated, and (iii) relativistic magnetically-dominated outflows. NSs with millisecond rotation periods and ~ 10^15 G magnetic fields drive relativistic winds with luminosities, energies, and Lorentz factors consistent with those required to produce long GRBs. <P />Evidence is growing for a class of short GRBs that are followed by an epoch of extended X-ray emission lasting ~ 10 -- 100 s. I propose that these events are produced by the formation of a magnetar following the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a white dwarf. The GRB is powered by accretion onto the NS from a small disk that is formed during AIC. The extended emission is produced by a relativistic wind that extracts the rotational energy of the proto- magnetar on a timescale ~ 10-100 s. I successfully model the light curve of the extended emission of GRB 060614 using spin-down calculations of a cooling proto-magnetar. <P />(2) A calculation of the nuclear composition of neutrino-heated magnetized winds from the surface of proto-magnetars and from the midplane of hyper- accreting disks in order to evaluate the conditions necessary for neutron-rich GRB outflows. Although the base of the wind is neutron-rich, weak interactions typically raise the neutron-to-proton ratio to ~ 1 just above the disk or PNS surface. Neutron-rich accretion disk winds possess a minimum mass-loss rate that precludes simultaneously ultra-relativistic winds from accompanying a substantial accretion power. <P />(3) Time-dependent models of the accretion disks created during compact object (CO) mergers. At early times the disk is cooled by neutrinos; neutrino irradiation of the disk produces a wind that synthesizes up to ~ 10^-3 [Special characters omitted.] of 56 Ni, resulting in a short-lived (~ 1 day) optical/ infrared transient. At later times, neutrino cooling becomes inefficient, alpha-particles form, and powerful outflows blow away the remaining mass of the disk. Since the disk is neutron rich and weak interactions freeze out when it becomes advective, these outflows robustly synthesize neutron-rich isotopes. The abundances of these rare isotopes strongly constrain the CO merger rate and the beaming fraction of short GRBs. <P />The accretion disks formed during AIC undergo a similar evolution. However, because the disk is irradiated by electron neutrinos from the central NS, the neutron-to-proton ratio increases to ~ 1 by the point of freeze out. As a result, outflows from the disk synthesize up to ~ 10^-2 [Special characters omitted.] in 56 Ni. Thus, AIC will be accompanied by a spectroscopically- distinct SN-like transient that should be detectable with upcoming optical transient surveys., Computer simulations of the cosmos suggest that cold streams of gas could underlie the unexpectedly high star-formation activity of many massive galaxies found to exist a few billion years after the Big Bang., Low-frequency interferometry provides us with the possibility of directly observing, via red-shifted 21cm emission, the ionization of the primordial intergalactic medium by radiation from the first stars and black holes. Building such interferometers presents daunting technical challenges related to the cross-correlation, calibration, and analysis of data from large antenna arrays with wide fields-of-view in an observing band below 200 MHz. Addressing cross-correlation data processing, I present a general-purpose correlator architecture that uses standard 10-Gbit Ethernet switches to pass data between flexible hardware modules containing Field Programmable Gate Array chips. These chips are programmed using open-source signal processing libraries developed to be flexible, scalable, and chip-independent. This work reduces the time and cost of implementing a wide range of signal processing systems, and facilitates upgrading to new generations of processing technology. This correlator architecture is supporting the incremental build-out of the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization. Targeting calibration concerns, I present a filtering technique that can be applied to individual baselines of wide-bandwidth, wide-field interferometric data to geometrically select regions on the celestial sphere that contain primary calibration sources. The technique relies on the Fourier transformation of wide-band frequency spectra from a given baseline to obtain one-dimensional ""delay images"", and then the transformation of a time-series of delay images to obtain two-dimensional ""delay/delayrate images."" These filters are augmented by a one-dimensional, complex CLEAN algorithm has been developed to compensate for data-excision effects related to the removal of radio frequency interference. This approach allows CLEANed, source-isolated data to be used to isolate bandpass and primary beam gain functions. These techniques are applied to PAPER data as a demonstration of their value in calibrating a new generation of low-frequency radio interferometers with wide relative bandwidths and large fields-of-view. Finally, I describe PAPER's overall architecture and summarize two PAPER deployments: a 4-antenna array in of Western Australia and an 8-antenna array in Green Bank, WV. After reporting on system characterization and data analysis techniques, I present an all-sky map synthesized between 139 MHz and 174 MHz using data from both arrays that reaches down to 80 mJy (4.9 K, for a beam size of 2.15e-5 steradians at 154 MHz), with a 10 mJy (620 mK) thermal noise level that indicates what would be achievable with better foreground subtraction. I calculate angular power spectra (Cℓ) in a cold patch and determine them to be dominated by point sources. Although the sample variance of foregrounds dominates errors in these power spectra, I measure a thermal noise level of 310 mK at ℓ = 100 for a 1.46-MHz band centered at 164.5 MHz. This sensitivity level is approximately three orders of magnitude in temperature above the expected level of 21cm fluctuations associated with reionization., I investigate the role of gravitation, turbulence, and radiation in forming low-mass stars. Molecular clouds are observed to be turbulent, but the origin of this turbulence is not well understood. Using a gravito-hydrodynamics adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code, I study the properties of cores and protostars in simulations in which the turbulence is driven to maintain virial balance and where it is allowed to decay. I demonstrate that cores forming in a decaying turbulence environment produce high-multiplicity protostellar systems with Toomre-Q unstable disks that exhibit characteristics of competitive accretion. In contrast, cores forming in a virialized cloud produce smaller protostellar systems with fewer low-mass members. Observations of molecular clouds are limited by projection, resolution, and the coupling between density and velocity information that is inherent in the molecular tracers commonly used to map molecular clouds. To compare with observations of core kinematics and shapes, I post-process the simulations to obtain dust emission maps and molecular line information. I demonstrate that some simulated observations are significantly different in the driven and decaying turbulence simulations, making them potential diagnostics for characterizing turbulence in observed starforming clouds. Although forming stars emit a substantial amount of radiation into their natal environment, the effects of radiative feedback on the star formation process have not been well studied. I perform simulations of protostars forming in a turbulent molecular cloud including grey flux-limited diffusion radiative transfer. I compare the distributions of stellar masses, accretion rates, and temperatures in simulations with and without radiative transfer, and I demonstrate that radiative feedback has a profound effect on accretion, multiplicity, and mass by reducing the number of stars formed and the total rate at which gas turns into stars. I also show that protostellar radiation is the dominant source of energy in the simulation, exceeding viscous dissipation and compressional heating by at least an order of magnitude. Although heating from protostars is mainly confined within the core envelope, I find that it is sufficient to suppress disk fragmentation that would otherwise result in very low-mass companions or brown dwarfs. I compare the simulation results with recent observations of local low-mass star forming regions and discuss the ""luminosity problem."" For future radiative transfer studies of star formation, I add multigroup radiative diffusion capability to the ORION AMR code., We report on our early photometric and spectroscopic observations of the extremely luminous Type II supernova (SN) 2008es. SN 2008es, with an observed peak optical magnitude of m<SUB>V</SUB> = 17.8 and at a redshift z = 0.213, has a peak absolute magnitude of M<SUB>V</SUB> = -22.3, making it the second most luminous SN ever observed. The photometric evolution of SN 2008es exhibits a fast decline rate (~ 0.042 mag d<SUP>-1</SUP>), similar to the extremely luminous Type II-Linear (II-L) SN 2005ap. We show that SN 2008es spectroscopically resembles the luminous Type II-L SN 1979C. Although the spectra of SN 2008es lack the narrow and intermediate-width line emission typically associated with the interaction of an SN with the circumstellar medium of its progenitor star, we argue that the extreme luminosity of SN 2008es is powered via strong interaction with a dense, optically thick circumstellar medium. The integrated bolometric luminosity of SN 2008es yields a total radiated energy at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths of gsim 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg. Finally, we examine the apparently anomalous rate at which the Texas Supernova Search has discovered rare kinds of SNe, including the five most luminous SNe observed to date, and find that their results are consistent with those of other modern SN searches., We present results of solar-wind parameters generated by 3D MHD models. The ENLIL inner-heliosphere solar-wind model together with the MAS or Wang - Sheeley - Arge (WSA) coronal models, describe the steady solar-wind stream structure and its origins in the solar corona. The MAS/ENLIL and WSA/ENLIL models have been tuned to provide a simulation of plasma moments as well as interplanetary magnetic-field magnitude and polarity in the absence of disturbances from coronal transients. To investigate how well the models describe the ambient solar wind structure from the Sun out to 1 AU, the model results are compared to solar-wind measurements from the ACE spacecraft. We find that there is an overall agreement between the observations and the model results for the general large-scale solar-wind structures and trends, such as the timing of the high-density structures and the low- and high-speed winds, as well as the magnetic sector structures. The time period of our study is the declining phase of Solar Cycle 23 when the solar activity involves well-defined stream structure, which is ideal for testing a quasi-steady-state solar-wind model., Distant supernovae (SNe) are not spatially resolved when observed from Earth, but these explosions result in ejecta with complicated spatial structures, including global deviations from spherical symmetry, chemical inhomogeneities, and substructure due to clumps. The purpose of this dissertation is to indirectly study the geometry of supernovae using the technique of optical spectropolarimetry. SN 2004S is a normal SN Ia observed nine days after maximum light and shows a low level of continuum polarization, 0.4%, which is typical for a SN Ia. Line polarization features are present and are rotated with respect to the continuum, indicating that the silicon, iron, and calcium distributions are distinct from the aspherical continuum photosphere. SN 2005hk is shown to be very spectroscopically similar to the peculiar SN la 2002cx. The continuum polarization level is normal and only weak Fe III line polarization features are present, indicating that the peculiarities of this subclass of SNe Ia are not a result of strong asphericities. SNe II have been shown in the past to have relatively spherical outer envelopes, but with evidence for increasing asphericity with time as the core is exposed. We present late-time spectropolarimetry of three SNe IIP (SNe 2006my, 2006ov, and 2007aa) which all show large polarizations (0.82-1.56%), indicative of large asphericities in their cores. SNe IIP are the most common form of core-collapse SNe, so our results imply that all core-collapse SNe have highly aspherical cores. We also present a detailed optical and near-infrared spectral sequence of the core-collapse SN 2008ax starting two days after shock breakout. SN 2008ax exploded with a very low-mass hydrogen envelope that produced strong Balmer absorption lines that rapidly disappeared as the object came to exhibit the spectra of a SN Ib. Two epochs of early-time spectropolarimetry, 6 and 9 days after shock breakout, revealed very strong line polarization modulations (up to 3.4% at Halpha), which were not aligned with each other and indicate that SN 2008ax had a complex geometry. Late-time spectropolarimetry and the nebular line profiles show that the inner ejecta were also highly aspherical., A statistical survey of the spectral shapes of 62 solar impulsive electron events detected in the ~ 1 to 300 keV range near Earth by the three-dimensional Plasma and Energetic Particles experiment on the WIND spacecraft is presented. The electron peak flux spectra generally show a broken power-law dependence with a steepening above ~ 60 keV. The break in the spectrum is pronounced with averaged power-law indices below and above the break of δ<SUB>low</SUB> = 1.9 ± 0.3 and δ<SUB>high</SUB> = 3.6 ± 0.7, respectively, and an averaged ratio δ<SUB>low</SUB>/δ<SUB>high</SUB> of 0.54 with a standard deviation of 0.09. Two correlations are found: (1) δ<SUB>low</SUB> and δ<SUB>high</SUB> are linearly correlated (correlation coefficient of 0.61), (2) The peak fluxes around the break energy and δ<SUB>low</SUB> are anticorrelated (coefficient 0.74), with larger events having flatter spectra below the break. Whether the observed spectral breaks are direct signatures of the solar acceleration processes or whether they are due to transport effects from the Sun to Earth is currently not understood., To realize the potential cost savings promised by printed electronics, high-speed, large-volume manufacturing methods must be established. Rotary printing techniques such as those used in the graphic arts are ideal candidates. However, very little research has been done on utilizing these techniques for printed electronics because digital processes such ink-jet printing have offered researchers a low-cost flexible solution for demonstrating the printability of their materials, despite the fact that these processes may be difficult to scale for large-volume manufacturing. In this thesis, gravure, a printing process which offers the highest resolution, highest speed, and largest volume production in the graphic arts is demonstrated as a viable technique for printed electronics. In order to make laboratory-scale research with this technique possible, a custom table-top gravure printing press was designed. This press allows for small amounts of ink to be utilized during a print and enables multi-layer prints with a registration accuracy not seen in conventional gravure printing presses and suitable for printed electronics. With this press, printing processes to deposit functional materials for printed circuits are investigated with a focus on developing process modules to manufacture fully printed organic thin film transistors. Considerable effort is made to establish processes to deposit metallic lines with feature sizes below 20 mum and a total surface roughness below 20 nm, uniform thin films of polymer dielectrics with thicknesses as low as 70 nm, and high performance polymer semiconductors. These processes are then integrated to manufacture capacitors suitable for integrated circuit components and organic thin film transistors with operating frequencies as high as 18 kHz., IceCube is an all-flavor, cubic kilometer neutrino telescope currently under construction in the deep glacial ice at the South Pole. Its embedded optical sensors detect Cherenkov light from charged particles produced in neutrino interactions in the ice. For several years IceCube has been detecting muon tracks from charged-current muon neutrino interactions. However, IceCube has yet to observe the electromagnetic or hadronic particle showers or ""cascades"" initiated by charged-current or neutral-current neutrino interactions. The first detection of such an event signature is expected to come from the known flux of atmospheric electron and muon neutrinos. A search for atmospheric neutrino-induced cascades was performed using 275.46 days of data from IceCube's 22-string configuration. Reconstruction and background rejection techniques were developed to reach, for the first time, a signal-to-background ratio ∼1. Above a reconstructed energy of 5 TeV, 12 candidate events were observed in the full dataset. The signal expectation from the canonical Bartol atmospheric neutrino flux model is 5.63+/-2.25 events, while the expectation from the atmospheric neutrino flux as measured by IceCube's predecessor array AMANDA is 7.48+/-1.50 events. Quoted errors include the uncertainty on the flux only. While a conclusive detection can not yet be claimed because of a lack of background Monte Carlo statistics, the evidence that we are at the level of background suppression needed to see atmospheric neutrino-induced cascades is strong. In addition, one extremely interesting candidate event of energy 133 TeV survives all cuts and shows an intriguing double pulse structure in its waveforms that may signal the ""double bang"" of a tau neutrino interaction., The downward transport of nonmethane hydrocarbons, condensed onto solid photochemically produced particles termed ""smust,"" may indeed be an important process in the methane-rich atmospheres of Jupiter and Titan. However, evidence supporting this mechanism on Jupiter [Hunten, D.M., 2008. Icarus 194, 616-622] is considerably weakened by three new considerations: the ethane mixing ratio does not increase with depth or show a 1-bar minimum, atmospheric characteristics measured by the probe throughout its descent are representative of much higher altitudes in the ""normal"" jovian atmosphere, and transport models must consider the lower boundary condition imposed by deep thermochemical destruction of nonmethane hydrocarbons. Additionally, ethane was not the most abundant nonmethane hydrocarbon detected by the Galileo Probe Mass Spectrometer (GPMS) near 11 bar, reinforcing previously published findings that some (if not all) of the nonmethane hydrocarbons detected by the GPMS were of instrumental rather than atmospheric origin., We have assembled a sample of 64 late-type spiral galaxies (T types 6.0-9.0, corresponding to Hubble types Scd-Sm) with archival Chandra data. At a signal-to-noise (S/N) threshold of 3, we find 12 objects with X-ray point-source detections in close proximity with the optical or near-infrared position of the nucleus (median offset δ = 1farcs6), suggestive of possible low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Including measurements with 3 &gt; S/N &gt; 1.5, our detections increase to 18. These X-ray sources range in luminosity from L <SUB>X</SUB>(2-10 keV) = 10<SUP>37.1</SUP> to 10<SUP>39.6</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Considering possible contamination from low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), we estimate that ~5 detections are possible LMXBs instead of true AGNs, based on the probability of observing an LMXB in a nuclear star cluster (NC) typically found in these late-type spiral galaxies. Given the typical ages of NCs, contamination by high-mass X-ray binaries is unlikely. This AGN fraction is higher than that observed in optical surveys, indicating that active nuclei, and hence central black holes (BHs), are more common than previously suggested. The incidence of AGN activity in such late-type spiral galaxies also suggests that nuclear massive BHs can form and grow in galaxies with little or no evidence for bulges. Follow-up multiwavelength observations will be necessary to confirm the true nature of these sources., We present observations of SCP 06F6, an unusual optical transient discovered during the Hubble Space Telescope Cluster Supernova Survey. The transient brightened over a period of ~100 days, reached a peak magnitude of ~ 21.0 in both i <SUB>775</SUB> and z <SUB>850</SUB>, and then declined over a similar timescale. There is no host galaxy or progenitor star detected at the location of the transient to a 3σ upper limit of i <SUB>775</SUB> &gt;= 26.4 and z <SUB>850</SUB> &gt;= 26.1, giving a corresponding lower limit on the flux increase of a factor of ~ 120. Multiple spectra show five broad absorption bands between 4100 Å and 6500 Å, and a mostly featureless continuum longward of 6500 Å. The shape of the light curve is inconsistent with microlensing. The transient's spectrum, in addition to being inconsistent with all known supernova types, does not match any spectrum in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey database. We suggest that the transient may be one of a new class. <P />Based in part on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the data archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI). STScI is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc. under the NASA contract NAS 5-26555. The observations are associated with program GO-10496. Based in part on observations obtained at the European Southern Observatory under ESO program 077.A-0110. Based in part on observations collected at Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W.M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA., Galaxy Zoo is the first study of nearby galaxies that contains reliable information about the spiral sense of rotation of galaxy arms for a sizeable number of galaxies. We measure the correlation function of spin chirality (the sense in which galaxies appear to be spinning) of face-on spiral galaxies in angular, real and projected spaces. Our results indicate a hint of positive correlation at separations less than ~0.5 Mpc at a statistical significance of 2σ-3σ. This is the first experimental evidence for chiral correlation of spins. Within the tidal torque theory, it indicates that the inertia tensors of nearby galaxies are correlated. This is complementary to the studies of nearby spin axis correlations that probe the correlations of the tidal field. Theoretical interpretation is made difficult by the small distances at which the correlations are detected, implying that substructure might play a significant role, and our necessary selection of face-on spiral galaxies, rather than a general volume-limited sample. <P />This publication has been made possible by the participation of more than 100000 volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project. Their individual contributions are acknowledged at http://www.galaxyzoo.org/Volunteers.aspx. <P />E-mail: anze@berkeley.edu, Context: Nearby young clusters are privileged places to study the star formation history. Over the last decade, the σ-Orionis cluster has been a prime location for the study of young very low mass stars, substellar and isolated planetary mass objects and the determination of the initial mass function. <BR />Aims: To extend previous studies of this association to its core, we searched for ultracool members and new multiple systems within the 1.5 arcmin×1.5 arcmin central region of the cluster. <BR />Methods: We obtained deep multi-conjugate adaptive optics (MCAO) images of the core of the σ-Orionis cluster with the prototype MCAO facility MAD at the VLT using the H and K<SUB>s</SUB> filters. These images allow us to detect companions fainter by Δ H ≈ 5 mag as close as 0.2 arcsec on a typical source with H=14.5 mag. These images were complemented by archival SofI K_s-band images and Spitzer IRAC and MIPS mid-infrared images <BR />Results: We report the detection of 2 new visual multiple systems, one being a candidate binary proplyd and the other one a low mass companion to the massive star σ Ori E. Of the 36 sources detected in the images, 25 have a H-band luminosity lower than the expected planetary mass limit for members, and H-K<SUB>s</SUB> color consistent with the latest theoretical isochrones. Nine objects have additional Spitzer photometry and spectral energy distribution consistent with them being cluster members. One of them has a spectral energy distribution from H to 3.6 μm consistent with that of a 5.5 M_Jup cluster member. Complementary NTT/SofI and Spitzer photometry allow us to confirm the nature and membership of two L-dwarf planetary mass candidates. <P />Based on observations made at the ESO La Silla and Paranal Observatory under programmes 67.C-0042, 074.C-0084, and 074.C-0628., We calculate the rate of photoevaporation of a circumstellar disk by energetic radiation (far-UV (FUV), 6 eV &lt;hν &lt; 13.6 eV; extreme-UV (EUV), 13.6 eV &lt;hν &lt; 0.1 keV; and X-rays, hν&gt;0.1 keV) from its central star. We focus on the effects of FUV and X-ray photons since EUV photoevaporation has been treated previously, and consider central star masses in the range 0.3-7 M <SUB>sun</SUB>. Contrary to the EUV photoevaporation scenario, which creates a gap at about r<SUB>g</SUB> ~ 7(M <SUB>*</SUB>/M <SUB>sun</SUB>) AU and then erodes the outer disk from inside out, we find that FUV photoevaporation predominantly removes less bound gas from the outer disk. Heating by FUV photons can cause significant erosion of the outer disk where most of the mass is typically located. X-rays indirectly increase the mass-loss rates (by a factor of ~2) by ionizing the gas, thereby reducing the positive charge on grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and enhancing FUV-induced grain photoelectric heating. FUV and X-ray photons may create a gap in the disk at ~10 AU under favorable circumstances. Photoevaporation timescales for M <SUB>*</SUB> ~ 1 M <SUB>sun</SUB> stars are estimated to be ~10<SUP>6</SUP> years, after the onset of disk irradiation by FUV and X-rays. Disk lifetimes do not vary much for stellar masses in the range 0.3-3 M <SUB>sun</SUB>. More massive stars (gsim7 M <SUB>sun</SUB>) lose their disks rapidly (in ~10<SUP>5</SUP> years) due to their high EUV and FUV fields. Disk lifetimes are shorter for shallow surface density distributions and when the dust opacity in the disk is reduced by processes such as grain growth or settling. The latter suggests that the photoevaporation process may accelerate as the dust disk evolves., Recent work has emphasized the possibility to probe non-Gaussianity of local type by measuring the power spectrum of highly biased tracers of large scale structure on very large scales. This method is limited by the cosmic variance, by the finite number of structures on the largest scales, and by the partial degeneracy with other cosmological parameters that can mimic the same effect. We propose an alternative method based on the fact that on large scales, halos are linearly biased, but not stochastic, tracers of dark matter: by correlating a highly biased tracer of large scale structure against an unbiased tracer, one eliminates the cosmic variance error, which can lead to a significant increase in signal to noise. For an ideal survey out to z∼2, the error reduction can be as large as a factor of 7, which should guarantee a detection of non-Gaussianity from an all-sky survey of this type., The annual cycle in the Earth's surface temperature is extremely large-comparable in magnitude to the glacial-interglacial cycles over most of the planet. Trends in the phase and the amplitude of the annual cycle have been observed, but the causes and significance of these changes remain poorly understood-in part because we lack an understanding of the natural variability. Here we show that the phase of the annual cycle of surface temperature over extratropical land shifted towards earlier seasons by 1.7 days between 1954 and 2007; this change is highly anomalous with respect to earlier variations, which we interpret as being indicative of the natural range. Significant changes in the amplitude of the annual cycle are also observed between 1954 and 2007. These shifts in the annual cycles appear to be related, in part, to changes in the northern annular mode of climate variability, although the land phase shift is significantly larger than that predicted by trends in the northern annular mode alone. Few of the climate models presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reproduce the observed decrease in amplitude and none reproduce the shift towards earlier seasons., This dissertation uses observations of galaxies and galaxy clusters as probes of the assembly of structure in the Universe. Galaxy mergers are key drivers of structure assembly, and we develop a new observational technique for identifying galaxy mergers. Our method identifies galaxy merger remnants by the spectral signatures of their inspiralling black holes, and we identify 32 such objects in the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey. Based on this sample, we find that mergers may trigger active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in red galaxies and estimate a merger rate of ~ 3 mergers Gyr -1 for red galaxies at redshifts 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 0.8. We also survey the additional insights into galaxy assembly possible with an extended sample of such objects and with measurements of the spatial offsets of the AGN within their host galaxies. <P />In addition, we use observations of galaxy clusters to test predictions from the standard Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model of structure formation. Using gravitational arcs as tracers of cluster mass distributions, we find that the mass profiles of observed lensing clusters are compatible with the profiles implied by ΛCDM simulations of structure formation. Similarly, we find that observed cluster concentrations, which are measures of the clusters' central densities, and masses follow the correlation expected from simulations. However, observed lensing clusters exhibit systematically higher concentrations, which we argue are the result of projection effects and cluster substructure. <P />Our cluster analysis also reveals that lensing clusters have unique formation histories. We find a correlation between the brightest cluster galaxy luminosities and cluster masses that implies lensing clusters were assembled via more mergers with other clusters, or mergers with more massive clusters, than the general cluster population. Finally, we explore means of reducing the scatter on cluster property correlations that provide constraints on cosmological parameters. Minimizing this scatter enables more precise measurements of cosmological parameters. We argue that exploiting both gravitational lensing for improved cluster mass estimates and the interdependencies of cluster concentration, mass, and X-ray temperature can tighten the correlations used to derive cosmological parameters., We consider the effect of tidal deformation, spin-orbit resonance, non-zero eccentricity, despinning, and reorientation on the global-scale gravity, shape, and tectonic patterns of planetary bodies. Large variations of the gravity and shape coefficients from the synchronous rotation and zero eccentricity values, J2/C22=10/3 and (b-c)/(a-c)=1/4, arise due to non-synchronous rotation and non-zero eccentricity even in the absence of reorientation or despinning. Reorientation or despinning induce additional variations. As an illustration of this theory, we consider the specific example of Mercury. The large gravity coefficients estimated from the Mariner 10 flybys cannot be attributed to the Caloris basin alone since the required mass excess in this case would have caused Caloris to migrate to one of Mercury's hot poles. Similarly, a large remnant bulge due to a smaller semimajor axis and spin-orbit resonance can be dismissed since the required semimajor axis is unphysically small (&lt; 0.1 AU). Reorientation of a large remnant bulge recording an epoch of faster rotation (without significant semimajor axis variations) can explain the large gravity coefficients. This requires initial rotation rates &gt; 20 times the present value and a positive gravity anomaly associated with Caloris capable of driving 10-45° equatorward reorientation. The required gravity anomaly can be explained by infilling of the basin with material of thicknesses &gt; 7 km, or an annulus of volcanic plains emplaced around the basin with annulus width ~ 1200 km and fill thicknesses &gt; 2 km. The predicted tectonic pattern due to these despinning and reorientation scenarios and radial contraction is in good agreement with the observed lobate scarp pattern., We present a method for simulating coronal emissions from solar active regions using observed photospheric magnetograms and an assumption about the coronal heating mechanism as input. The method invokes a ""quasi-force-free"" (minimized Lorentz force) coronal magnetic solution and a steady state energy balance model solved along field lines. Coronal heating is included using parameterized approximations relating the heat deposited to properties of the magnetic field. We use calculated temperatures and densities to predict emissions and compare to observations from the Yohkoh Soft X-ray satellite. We use NOAA active region 8210 to test the model's sensitivities. We find predicted intensities and emission morphologies change little with different assumptions for the coronal magnetic field. We test methods for calculating the proportionality constant in a heating scale relationship and find filling factors of ~(1-5) × 10<SUP>-2</SUP> are needed to match temperature in the cases considered. We investigate the effect of heating scale height, finding that loop-top heating improves temperature predictions but decreases success of the emission morphology prediction. Footpoint heating has the opposite effect. Overall, our model produces relatively robust results for a wide range of assumptions. Yet the results are highly sensitive to the input coronal heating parameterization, making our method a powerful approach for discriminating between heating mechanisms. Nevertheless, we find substantial discrepancies between our synthetic emissions and observed emissions. We investigate sources of discrepancy and suggest that improved magnetic field extrapolations and dynamic heating are necessary to improve simulations., The comprehensive THEMIS approach to solving the substorm problem calls for monitoring the nightside auroral oval with low-cost, robust white-light imagers and magnetometers that can deliver high time resolution data (0.33 and 2 Hz, respectively). A network of 20 Ground-Based Observatories (GBOs) are deployed across Canada and Alaska to support the collection of data from these instruments. Here we describe the system design of the observatory, with emphasis on how the design meets the environmental and data-collection requirements. We also review the design of the All Sky Imager (ASI), discuss how it was built to survive Arctic deployments, and summarize the optical characterizations performed to qualify the design to meet THEMIS mission requirements., New techniques using laser-driven shock waves reveal the pressure - temperature conditions at which mantle rocks (silicates and oxides) become metallic fluids, hence core-like constituents. Experiments reaching peak pressures and temperatures of about 700 GPa (7 Mbar) and 3 x 104 K (3 eV) allow interpolation with lower-pressure measurements to reveal the properties of MgO, MgSiO3 and SiO2 at conditions of deep planetary interiors. We document shock-induced melting of MgO (14,970 ± 300 K at 470 ± 10 GPa) and MgSiO3 (7740 ± 450 K at 275 ± 10 GPa), and confirm previous findings for SiO2 (melting at 5620 ± 450 K at 116 ± 10 GPa), by monitoring temperature as a function of time for each sample as it is compressed by a strong but decaying shock wave. The melts show evidence of reflectivity &gt; 20% at visible wavelengths, implying metallization ('ionization') of these oxides through the combined effects of pressure and temperature. These results indicate a blurring of the distinction between silicate and metallic constituents at the core-mantle boundary, particularly at the high temperatures immediately following a late-stage giant (Moon-forming) impact., THEMIS, NASA’s fifth Medium Class Explorer (MIDEX) mission will monitor the onset and macro-scale evolution of magnetospheric substorms. It is a fleet of 5 small satellites (probes) measuring in situ the magnetospheric particles and fields while a network of 20 ground based observatories (GBOs) monitor auroral brightening over Northern America. Three inner probes (∼1 day period, 10 R<SUB>E</SUB> apogee) monitor current disruption and two outer probes (∼2 day and ∼4 day period, 20 R<SUB>E</SUB> and 30 R<SUB>E</SUB> apogees respectively) monitor lobe flux dissipation. In order to time and localize substorm onsets, THEMIS utilizes Sun Earth aligned conjunctions between the probes when the ground-based observatories are on the nightside. To maintain high recurrence of conjunctions the outer orbits have to be actively adjusted during each observation season. Orbit maintenance is required to rearrange the inner probes for dayside observations and also inject the probes into their science orbits after near-simultaneous release from a common launch vehicle. We present an overview of the orbit strategy, which is primarily driven by the scientific goals of the mission but also represents a compromise between the probe thermal constraints and fuel capabilities. We outline the process of orbit design, describe the mission profile and explain how mission requirements are targeted and evaluated. Mission-specific tools, based on high-fidelity orbit prediction and common magnetospheric models, are also presented. The planning results have been verified by in-flight data from launch through the end of the first primary science seasons and have been used for mission adjustments subject to the early scientific results from the coast phase and first tail season., THEMIS—a five-spacecraft constellation to study magnetospheric events leading to auroral outbursts—launched on February 17, 2007. All aspects of operations are conducted at the Mission Operations Center at the University of California at Berkeley. Activities of the multi-mission operations team include mission and science operations, flight dynamics and ground station operations. Communications with the constellation are primarily established via the Berkeley Ground Station, while NASA’s Ground Network provides secondary pass coverage. In addition, NASA’s Space Network supports maneuver operations near perigee. Following a successful launch campaign, the operations team performed on-orbit probe bus and instrument check-out and commissioning tasks, and placed the constellation initially into a coast phase orbit configuration to control orbit dispersion and conduct initial science operations during the summer of 2007. Mission orbit placement was completed in the fall of 2007, in time for the first winter observing season in the Earth’s magnetospheric tail. Over the course of the first 18 months of on-orbit constellation operations, procedures for instrument configuration, science data acquisition and navigation were refined, and software systems were enhanced. Overall, the implemented ground systems at the Mission Operations Center proved to be very successful and completely adequate to support reliable and efficient constellation operations. A high degree of systems automation is employed to support lights-out operations during off-hours., The five identical THEMIS Spacecraft, launched in February 2007, carry two magnetometers on each probe, one DC fluxgate (FGM) and one AC search coil (SCM). Due to the small size of the THEMIS probes, and the short length of the magnetometer booms, magnetic cleanliness was a particularly complex task for this medium sized mission. The requirements leveled on the spacecraft and instrument design required a detailed approach, but one that did not hamper the development of the probes during their short design, production and testing phase. In this paper we describe the magnetic cleanliness program’s requirements, design guidelines, program implementation, mission integration and test philosophy and present test results, and mission on-orbit performance., NASA has provided several opportunities to apply for funding of education and outreach programs. One such opportunity was as a supplement to successful scientific proposed efforts under the ROSES program. NASA funded our institutional E/PO program as a supplement to a combination of three scientists' grants in the fields of Earth's magnetosphere and aurora. This effort launched a Great Explorations in Math and Science (GEMS) teacher professional development site while also starting an introductory-level community college science seminar course. The goals were to provide effective and relevant curriculum for teachers of underserved rural children and to inspire urban community college adults. The GEMS site was launched in South Dakota in 2006 for teachers of grades 1-8, the first such site in this state. Two years later, we went back to present a follow-up teacher workshop, introducing several new teachers to the resources of this new GEMS site. At the community college, we brought in scientists from the Space Sciences Lab (UC Berkeley) to discuss space weather and astronomy at an accessible level, in 2006 and 2007. This type of introductory- level science seminar course is unusual, especially in a community college. We provide a description of the design of the community college seminar and GEMS site, lessons learned, and many of our evaluation results from this program. The success of this proposed effort is in a large part due to our partnerships with the Lawrence Hall of Science, the South Dakota Discovery Center and Aquarium, and Berkeley City College (formerly known as Vista Community College), part of the Peralta Community College District. We hope other scientists and E/PO professionals can learn from our efforts and apply some of the ideas to future E/PO efforts., The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) is optimized for fine energy and spatial resolution of hard X-ray (HXR) emission from solar flares. Most RHESSI flares exhibit strong HXR emission from bright flare loop footpoints, drowning out faint emission from higher in the corona. Partial occultation of flares by the solar disk obscures these bright footpoints, allowing for detailed observations of faint coronal HXR sources. It is therefore necessary to identify and characterize flares with high occultation heights. Here we present a technique for determining flare occultation heights by extrapolating the paths of active flare regions across the solar disk. A statistical study of 55 flares compares occultation heights to nonthermal X-ray emission. Compared with statistical results of on-disk flares, it is estimated that this coronal emission is at least 20 times fainter than the expected footpoint emission, confirming that partial occultation is crucial for the study of faint coronal sources. HXR images made by RHESSI are also compared with images at longer wavelengths from the TRACE, EIT, and STEREO instruments., The Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) mission is the fifth NASA Medium-class Explorer (MIDEX), launched on February 17, 2007 to determine the trigger and large-scale evolution of substorms. The mission employs five identical micro-probes (termed “probes”), which have orbit periods of one, two and four days. Each of the Probes carries five instruments to measure electric and magnetic fields as well as ions and electrons. Each probe weighs 134 kg including 49 kg of hydrazine fuel and measures approximately 0.8×0.8×1.0 meters ( L× W× H) and operates on an average power budget of 40 watts. For launch, the Probes were integrated to a Probe Carrier and separated via a launch vehicle provided pyrotechnic signal. Attitude data are obtained from a sun sensor, inertial reference unit and the instrument Fluxgate Magnetometer. Orbit and attitude control use a RCS system having two radial and two axial thrusters for roll and thrust maneuvers. Its two fuel tanks and pressurant system yield 960 meters/sec of delta-V, sufficient to allow Probe replacement strategies. Command and telemetry communications use an S-band 5 watt transponder through a cylindrical omni antenna with a toroidal gain pattern. This paper provides the key requirements of the probe, an overview of the probe design and how they were integrated and tested. It includes considerations and lessons learned from the experience of building NASA’s largest constellation., The five “Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms” (THEMIS) micro-satellites launched on a common carrier by a Delta II, 7925 heavy, on February 17, 2007. This is the fifth launch in the NASA MeDIum class EXplorer (MIDEX) program. In the mission proposal the decision was made to have the University of California Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory (UCB-SSL) mechanical engineering staff provide all of the spacecraft appendages, in order to meet the short development schedule, and to insure compatibility. This paper describes the systems engineering, design, development, testing, and on-orbit deployment of these boom systems that include: the 1 and 2 meter carbon fiber composite magnetometer booms, the 40 and 50 m tip to tip orthogonal spin-plane wire boom pairs, and the 6.3 m dipole stiff axial booms., During the pre-launch phase of NASA’s THEMIS mission, the Education and Public Outreach (E/PO) program successfully brought the excitement of THEMIS to the public, students and teachers through a variety of programs. The Geomagnetic Event Observation Network by Students (GEONS) was the main effort during this time, a project in which 13 magnetometers were placed in or near 13 rural schools across the country. High school teachers and a few middle school teachers at these and/or neighboring schools took part in a long-term professional development program based around space science and the magnetometer data. The teachers created week-long to semester-long projects during which their students worked on THEMIS lessons that they, their colleagues, and the E/PO team created. In addition to this program, THEMIS E/PO also launched the only Lawrence Hall of Science (LHS) Great Explorations in Mathematics and Science (GEMS) site in Nevada. This site provides a sustainable place for teacher professional development using hands-on GEMS activities, and has been used by teachers around the state of Nevada. Short-term professional development for K-12 teachers (one-hour to two-day workshops), with a focus on the Tribal College and Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) communities have reached hundreds of teachers across the country. A Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) ViewSpace show on auroras and THEMIS was created and distributed, and shown in over a hundred science centers and museums nationwide. The THEMIS E/PO program developed and maintained a THEMIS E/PO Website for dissemination of (1) information and multimedia about the science and engineering of THEMIS, (2) updated news about the mission in language appropriate for the public, (3) the GEONS data, the GEONS teacher guides with classroom activities, and (4) information about the THEMIS E/PO program. Hundreds of thousands of visitors have viewed this website. In this paper, we describe these programs along with the evaluation results, and discuss what lessons we learned along the way., Circumstellar disks provide the material reservoir for the growth of young stars and for planet formation. We combine a high-level radiative transfer program with a thermal-chemical model of a typical T Tauri star disk to investigate the diagnostic potential of the far-infrared lines of water for probing disk structure. We discuss the observability of pure rotational H<SUB>2</SUB>O lines with the Herschel Space Observatory, specifically the residual gas where water is mainly frozen out. We find that measuring both the line profile of the ground 1<SUB>10</SUB>-1<SUB>01</SUB> ortho-H<SUB>2</SUB>O transition and the ratio of this line to the 3<SUB>12</SUB>-3<SUB>03</SUB> and 2<SUB>21</SUB>-2<SUB>12</SUB> lines can provide information on the gas-phase water between 5 and 100 AU, but not on the snow line which is expected to occur at smaller radii., We present observations of the ionospheric response to a hot flow anomaly (HFA) interacting with the magnetosphere. On 4 July 2007, the THEMIS spacecraft observed a HFA on both sides of the bow shock. The ionospheric response was measured by global auroral images taken over the southern hemisphere by Polar UVI, by ground based magnetometers and photometers in Antarctica, and by the THEMIS Ground Based Observatories (GBOs) in the northern hemisphere. Polar UVI observations show a region of enhanced auroral emission in the morning sector about 10 minutes after the THEMIS spacecraft observed the HFA. This region of enhanced emission was located above South Pole station which observed an increase in the auroral luminosity and magnetic perturbations. The THEMIS GBOs in the conjugate hemisphere also observed magnetic perturbations consistent with a traveling convection vortex. Polar UVI tracked the spatial and temporal development of the region of enhanced emission. Slow anti-sunward motion was observed as the emission weakened and then re-brightened over the course of about 10 minutes. Simultaneously, the THEMIS GBO array observed anti-sunward motion of the magnetic impulse with a velocity much greater than that of the auroral emission. The origin of the magnetic perturbation and resulting auroral emission is suggested to be the deformation of the magnetopause due to the HFA-magnetosphere interaction. The different propagation speeds of the auroral emission in the southern hemisphere and the magnetic perturbation in the northern hemisphere imply either 1) a decoupling of the auroral emission and field-aligned current signature or 2) a decoupling of these processes between the two hemispheres. The large difference in the ionospheric conductivity between the northern (summer) and southern (winter) hemispheres may be an important factor in this decoupling., Sub-solar magnetopause measurements of asymmetric magnetic field reconnection on the Polar and THEMIS satellites are compared with a PIC simulation having open boundary conditions and a guide field to show the excellent agreement between the two data sets on both ion and electron spatial scales. Examples involving parallel electric fields, violations of the frozen-in condition, and regions where electron scale physics are important will be discussed., Chromospheric evaporation (CE) - thought to occur when downward-accelerated coronal electrons impact the denser chromosphere, heating the ambient material which then rises to fill the flaring loop - has often been suggested as the primary source of hot thermal looptop plasma. Evidence for CE is given by crystal spectrometer observations of blueshifted spectral lines from footpoints. RHESSI observations show that peak flare temperatures generally occur soon after the hard X-ray (HXR; &gt;20~keV) peak, when the emission measure is still only ~20% of its later peak value. Imaging places the thermal plasma at the looptop even for large (GOES X-class) flares that exceed super-hot (Te &gt; 30~MK) temperatures. In such flares, non-thermal energy deposition can exceed ~1029~erg/s, which for typical electron energies, chromospheric densities, and footpoint areas should yield CE temperatures of ~10-20~MK with emission measures of ~1050~cm-3. Such bright thermal emission has never been observed from footpoints, suggesting that while CE may contribute the bulk loop material, heating occurs primarily in the corona. We present an analysis of selected RHESSI M- and X-class flares, employing imaging spectroscopy to determine the temperature and emission measure (or limits thereof) of spatially-separated footpoint and looptop sources. We compare the time evolution of the thermal footpoint signatures to HXR lightcurves and to the looptop thermal component. We calculate the energy contained in non-thermal electrons, the thermal energies at the looptop and footpoints, and discuss the implications for heating by non-thermal electrons and the contribution of CE to the thermal flare plasma., Low energy (&lt; 1keV) counter-streaming and flat-top electron distributions accompanying fast ion bulk speed flowing tailward (~350 km/s) have been observed by Cluster spacecraft in the vicinity of the current sheet in Earth's magnetic tail (-18 Re). These distributions were detected simultaneously with Langmuir (2-6 kHz) and whistler mode (0-50 Hz) waves. The streaming and thermal energies of the electron beams vary from ~150 to 800 eV and ~50 to 100 eV where the higher values correspond to measurements made closer to the current sheet (CS). In the central CS, the electron distributions are isotropic and the beams disappear as do the Langmuir and high frequency (8-50 Hz) whistler waves. At the edges of this region, the magnetic field (B) and density gradients are strong and can increase the propagation angle of the whistler waves that preferentially propagate parallel or anti-parallel to B. Thus, the strong magnetic and density gradients could prevent the whistler waves from propagating deeper into the CS. Instead, low frequency (&lt; 2 Hz) whistler waves (compressional Alfvén waves) are observed with perpendicular or oblique wave vectors. These Alfvén waves fade away in the central part of the central CS where the plasma beta (β=2μ0nkT/B2) reaches ~ 100. Theoretical explanations for these observations must take into account that ions are non-magnetized and that dynamics occur on scales smaller than the ion Larmor radius., A new Small Explorer mission, the Neutral Ion Coupling Explorer (NICE) mission, was selected for study by NASA to specifically address neutral ion coupling in the Earth's atmosphere. The main goal of NICE is to study neutral-ion coupling at low latitudes where the densest plasma in geospace is created and where a number of remarkable interactions between the plasma and neutral gas occur even in the relative absence of high-latitude forcing. NICE will study this region from a ~24 degree inclination 550 km circular orbit, residing entirely on closed magnetic field lines. The relatively fast precession of low-inclination orbit is favorable for frequent sampling of all local times for the determination of tidal structures. It is now widely recognized that the neutral thermosphere has a strong influence on the ionosphere and that Earth's ionosphere at quiet times is actually tidally dominated. The NICE concept is unique in simultaneously providing measurements of the parameters relevant to ion production and motion across the entire altitude range of the low-latitude ionosphere. The science payload consists of 3 remote sensing instruments viewing the atmospheric limb (1) a dual Doppler Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FP), scanning in altitude to measure neutral wind vector and temperature altitude profiles in the E- and F-regions, (2) a Far Ultraviolet (FUV) imager to measure daytime neutral composition and image the nighttime F-layer intensity distributions, and (3) an Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) altitude profiler to retrieve daytime F-layer properties. In addition, an Ion Velocity Meter (IVM) measures the in-situ ion drifts. NICE will take advantage of an elegant choice of orbit and instrument viewing geometries to make coordinated and complementary observations at all local times, with optimal conjunction of measurements occurring near the equator. The observations are accompanied by a suite of advanced numerical models and analysis techniques., We provide estimates of volcanism versus time for planets with Earth-like composition and masses up to 25 times Earth, as a step toward predicting atmospheric mass on extrasolar rocky planets. We use a thermal evolution model, calibrated against Earth, in combination with standard melting models, to explore the dependence of convection-driven decompression mantle melting on planet mass. We find:- (1) volcanism is likely to proceed on massive planets with plate tectonics over the main-sequence lifetime of the parent star; (2) crustal thickness (and melting rate normalized to planet mass) is weakly dependent on planet mass; (3) stagnant lid planets can have higher rates of melting than their plate tectonic counterparts early in their thermal evolution, but melting shuts down after a few Gyr; (4) plate tectonics may not operate on high mass planets because of their production of buoyant crust which is difficult to subduct; and (5) melting is necessary but insufficient for efficient volcanic degassing; volatiles partition into the earliest, deepest melts, which may be denser than the residue and sink to the base of the mantle on young, massive planets. Magma must also crystallize at or near the surface, and the pressure of overlying volatiles must be fairly low, if volatiles are to reach the surface., Solar energetic particle (SEP) events and the associated extremes in solar wind plasma conditions, magnetic fields, and energetic particle fluxes have significant effects on the local plasma environments at the Earth, other planets, and their moons. The Moon, which lacks a significant atmosphere or global magnetic field, lies fully exposed to the effects of these solar inputs. Previous investigations have demonstrated the direct coupling between solar drivers and the lunar plasma environment, revealing that increased energetic particle fluxes associated with SEP events act to charge the shadowed lunar surface to negative potentials as high as several kilovolts. In this presentation we explore the effects of large SEP events and other disturbances on the lunar plasma environment by comparing Lunar Prospector data during selected events with data from quiet times. We further consider the influence of SEP events on lunar surface charging, and investigate their effects on the structure of the lunar plasma wake. We also examine the impact of solar events on all aspects of the lunar magnetic field environment, including quasi-steady magnetic field structures associated with the wake and transient structures produced by local interactions with crustal magnetic fields., STEREO's IMPACT (In-situ Measurements of Particles and CME Transients) investigation provides the first opportunity for long duration, detailed observations of 1 AU magnetic field structures, plasma and suprathermal electrons, and energetic particles at points bracketing Earth's heliospheric location. The IMPACT team has developed several online web portals which provide easy access to plots and data products. These portals integrate data from other heliospheric and solar missions as well as results from the modeling community to help scientists analyze events and trace features from their solar origins to 1 AU. We discuss lessons learned from this experience with implications for others who might develop similar sites for their own missions and for data providers who wish to have their data served through such sites. We emphasize the ongoing need in our community for well-documented and consistent online data access and the ways data providers can meet this need. Finally, we demonstrate how integrated data browsers, such as ours, can help to enable the kinds of cross-disciplinary research necessary for a more complete understanding of the physical processes that connect geospace with solar events., The THEMIS plasma instrument is designed to measure the ion and electron distribution functions over the energy range from a few eV up to 30 keV for electrons and 25 keV for ions. The instrument consists of a pair of “top hat” electrostatic analyzers with common 180°×6° fields-of-view that sweep out 4 π steradians each 3 s spin period. Particles are detected by microchannel plate detectors and binned into six distributions whose energy, angle, and time resolution depend upon instrument mode. On-board moments are calculated, and processing includes corrections for spacecraft potential. This paper focuses on the ground and in-flight calibrations of the 10 sensors on five spacecraft. Cross-calibrations were facilitated by having all the plasma measurements available with the same resolution and format, along with spacecraft potential and magnetic field measurements in the same data set. Lessons learned from this effort should be useful for future multi-satellite missions., The new balloon-borne Gamma-Ray Imager/Polarimeter for Solar flares (GRIPS) instrument will provide a near-optimal combination of high-resolution imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetry of solar-flare gamma-ray/hard X-ray emissions from ~20 keV to &gt;~10 MeV. The spectrometer/polarimeter consists of sixteen 3D position-sensitive germanium detectors (3D-GeDs), where each energy deposition is individually recorded with an energy resolution of a few keV FWHM and a spatial resolution to within &lt;0.1 mm3. Imaging is accomplished by a single multi-pitch rotating modulator (MPRM), a 2-cm thick tungsten grid with pitches that range quasi-continuously from 1 to 13 mm. With the MPRM situated 8 meters from the spectrometer, this instrument will provide excellent image quality and unparalleled angular resolution at gamma-ray energies (12.5 arcsec FWHM), sufficient to separate the 2.2 MeV footpoint sources for almost all flares. Polarimetry is accomplished by analyzing the anisotropy of reconstructed Compton scattering in the 3D-GeDs (i.e. as an active scatterer), with an estimated minimum detectable polarization of a few percent at 150--650 keV in an X-class flare. GRIPS will address questions relevant to particle acceleration and energy release that have been raised by recent solar flare observations, such as: What causes the spatial separation between energetic electron producing hard X-rays and energetic ions producing gamma-ray lines? How anisotropic are the accelerated electrons, and why do relativistic electron dominate in the corona? How does the composition of accelerated and ambient material vary with space and time, and why?, The solar wind interacts directly with the atmospheres of planets that do not have intrinsic magnetic fields, leading to direct atmospheric escape. The Mars Express and Venus Express spacecraft measure this interaction with the ASPERA 3 and 4 Ion Mass Analyzer instruments. Energy-time spectrograms of high mass ions show dispersed energy signatures that can be associated with the ion pick-up process which depends on the conditions in the solar wind. The subject of this study is a comparison between the pick-up ion signatures seen at Mars and Venus. A survey of the data reveals that high energy pick-up signatures are more common at Venus than Mars. The features gain energy with altitude at both planets, but achieve higher peak energies at Venus. The differences in what is observed may be due to ion gyroradius effects and/or orbital sampling bias. Modeling is necessary to understand these issues., We have analyzed pseudo breakup events in the aurora using 37 second LBHL Polar/UVI data during the months of November and December 2007 to study the relationship between breakups and pseudo breakups. Historically, the distinction between pseudo breakups, which expand locally, and normal breakups, which expand more globally, has been ill defined. We now present an explicit definition based on MLat expanse and peak auroral power. Often, the aurora will exhibit a series of pseudo breakup events before the commencement of a normal breakup. Sometimes a normal breakup does not occur. We analyze the properties of pseudo breakups and parameters that might make a normal breakup more or less likely to occur after a series of pseudo breakup events. There is no statistical difference in MLat location, peak area, peak power dissipation, and total energy deposition for individual pseudo breakups leading to a normal breakup and those that do not. A normal breakup is likely to occur only during the first 100 minutes of a sequence of pseudo breakups. Pseudo breakup sequences leading to a breakup are much shorter than those not leading to a breakup. However, distributions of total energy (in electron precipitation) for sequences leading and not leading to a normal breakup are the same. Although the physical implications of our results are complicated and unclear, pseudo breakup events should be incorporated in any magnetospheric substorm model., We use measurements from the Wind spacecraft to study Langmuir wave growth in the source region of four separate in situ interplanetary type III bursts. Velocity distributions of energetic electron are used to compute the advection beam speed and growth rate (in the cold beam approximation) and these beam speeds and growth rates are compared with Langmuir wave activity and detailed features of the Langmuir wave spectra and waveforms. Knowledge of the electron beam speed lets us compute the resonant wavenumber and the expected spacecraft frequency of both daughter Langmuir waves and ion acoustic waves required for the parametric decay process. We find no strong evidence for decay products nor carrier splitting that is consistent with parametric decay. On the other hand, many of the Langmuir waveforms show 'polarization' signatures that may be consistent with linear mode conversion or trapped eigenmode interpretations of type III wave processes., For some purposes, ""authentic"" can pertain to work that is original research that could lead to publication. In other contexts, ""authentic"" might mean activities that involve collecting real data and analyzing it, even though the work is by nature of a laboratory exercise, rather than new research. This paper explores the nuances of what people might actually mean by ""authentic"" and what the implications of that are in a social context for educational projects. The Hands-On Universe project, as related to The NASA Kepler mission as well as the International Astronomical Search Collaboration asteroid search project, is taken to be one form of ""authentic"" science, and compared with other projects that may or may not be considered ""authentic."", Everyone experiences landscapes and has a sense about how they work: water runs down hill, it erodes and carries sediments, and that's about it, right? Introductory earth science text books are uniformly qualitative about the field, and leave one with little sense of wonder, and certainly not ""shock"". But four shocks occur if one peels away the first impressions. First, landscapes are surprisingly similar: the same forms are repeated in virtually all environments, including under the ocean and on other planets. Second, we lack theory and mechanistic observations to answer many simple first-order questions, e.g. what controls the width of a river, how does rock type control hillslope form and erosion rate, or, is there a topographic signature of life. Third, there are unexpected connections between surface erosion, deep earth processes, and climate. And fourth, the field itself, despite having been a subject of study for well over 100 years, is currently experiencing a revolution of ideas and discoveries through new tools, observatories, centers, journals, books, contributions of researchers from other disciplines, and from a significant hiring of young researchers in geomorphology. Deep messages await discovery in the simple landforms surrounding us., It has been a long-standing controversy whether coronal metric type II bursts are generated by CME-driven shocks or flare blast waves. Using unprecedented high-cadence observations from STEREO/SECCHI, we investigate the relationship between a metric type II event and a shock driven by the 2007 December 31 CME. The CME occurs at the east limb and its evolution is observed from about 1.1 to several tens of solar radii. The existence of the CME-driven shock is indicated by the deflection of coronal structures before the CME impinges on them, the best evidence for shocks in imaging observations. The earliest deflection of distant coronal structures occurs at 00:51:22 UT, about 2.6 min before the metric type II onset. The CME- driven shock emerges from the corona and produces a break point in the streamer north of the CME, which allows us to follow the shock propagation in imaging observations for the first time. We also have a continuous frequency coverage of the radio dynamic spectrum by combining observations from STEREO/SWAVES, BIRS and Learmonth, which successfully establishes the connection between the metric and decametric-hectometric (DH) type II bursts. The CME speed is about 600 km/s at the time of the metric type II onset, larger than the Alfven speed 420 - 490 km/s determined from the band splitting of the metric type II burst. The shock height-time curve determined from the metric and DH type II bands is consistent with the shock propagation obtained from the streamer deflection. These results provide unambiguous evidence that the metric type II burst is caused by the CME-driven shock. Implications are also discussed for particle acceleration and space weather forecasting., Electromagnetic fluctuations in the inertial range of solar wind MHD turbulence and beyond (up to frequencies of 10Hz) have recently been studied for the first time using both magnetic field and electric field measurements on Cluster [Bale et al., PRL, 2005]. It has been shown that at frequencies above the spectral breakpoint at ~0.4Hz, in the so-called dissipation range, the wave modes become dispersive and are consistent with Kinetic Alfven Waves (KAW). This interpretation is based on the simple assumption that the measured frequency spectrum is actually a Doppler shifted wave number spectrum (ω ≈ k Vsw), commonly used in the solar wind and known as Taylor's hypothesis. While Taylor's hypothesis is valid in the inertial range of solar wind turbulence, it may break down in the dissipation range where temporal fluctuations can become important. In this work, we analyze the effect of Doppler shift on KAW as well as compressional proton whistler waves, and revisit Cluster solar wind data using this approach. We focus our analysis on low-beta (β &lt; 1) ambient solar wind intervals. We first determine, both analytically and numerically, the dispersive properties of the KAW and the whistler wave modes and estimate the electric to magnetic field (E⊥/B⊥) ratio in the plasma and the spacecraft frame. Finally, we compare those estimates with the data directly in the spacecraft frame., The observation that fossil diversity is strongly modulated by two cycles, 62 Myr and 140 Myr, is one of the strangest discoveries of the last few years in geology and paleontology. (1) The cycles show strongest among those genera that are short-lived, i.e. endured for 45 Myr or less. In an attempt to identify patterns, we have subdivided the data into 170 groups consisting of various phyla, orders and classes, to examine the strength of the cycles; these results will be presented. As examples, the 62 Myr cycle is absent in the segmented worms (annelida), strong in the porifera, strong in the echinoderms, moderate in the bryosoa, moderate in the older anthropoda, very weak in the foraminifera, insignificant in the bivalves, very strong in the spiriferids, strong in trilobites, and very weak in fishes. No clear pattern has emerged from analysis of these taxonomic units. Several models will be discussed that could account for the cycles. One is the possibility of a helium-3 instability in the sun. Helium-3 is produced in the inner regions of the sun, but burned and destroyed in the deepest part of the core; only a layer outside the core remains. A regular overturn of the layer mixing it into the deeper core would result in a cycle of solar activity with a few percent modulation and a period that could be between 50 to 200 Myr.(2) This idea once received a great deal of attention when it was thought to be an explanation for the low flux of neutrinos from the sun. A second model to explain the cycle is the passage of the sun through variations in the mass density of the Milky Way Galaxy. Higher density puts an increased torque on comets in the Oort clould; that diminishes the angular momentum of half of them, and increases the eccentricity of the orbits. Doubling of the density (e.g. caused by passage through a giant molecular cloud or an arm of the galaxy) would result in a doubling of the number of comets hitting the earth. The passage through the arms of the galaxy has too long a period for the 62 Myr cycle, but could account for the 140 Myr cycle. We know that cometary impacts have major consequences for the diversity of life. We will discuss the possibility of such structure in the Milky Way. We will also present a description of other proposed explanations for the cycles, most of which can be ruled out. References: 1. Cycles in fossil diversity, Robert A. Rohde and Richard A.

Gough, Nature vol. 240, pp. 262-264; 293-294 (Dec. 1, 1972), THEMIS electric and magnetic field measurements are combined with ion flows determined from the plasma and energetic particle instruments to investigate deviations from the ""ion frozen-in"" condition (E + VixB = 0) during geomagnetic substorms. It is found that the vast majority of ion flows during inner-magnetospheric dipolarizations can be classified as ""frozen-in"" within measurement uncertainties. In an unanticipated result, the largest deviations from frozen-in are found at the end of the substorm growth phase as the plasmasheet thins, rather than during the dipolarization process. Plasmasheet thinning is coincident with an increased current density which manifests itself as an increasing ion flow in the duskward direction. This duskward flow is the result of the ion pressure gradient perpendicular to the current sheet and has no associated electric field. Applying these measurements to the generalized Ohms Law, it appear that the non-zero ""VixB"" term that we measure during growth phase is just that portion of the Hall term, JxB/ne, which results from ion motion in the cross tail current. Deviations from the ion frozen-in condition are also found for brief periods during the dipolarization process, however these deviations are generally associated with ion pressure gradients, and therefore likely due to similar diamagnetic currents. These results suggest that the current disruption model, which requires significant breaking of the frozen-in condition by terms other than those resulting from diamagnetic effects, is inconsistent with the observations., Recently Ergun with co-authors [1] have published an interesting observation by WAVES experiment onboard STEREO (S/WAVES) satellite: Langmuir wave eigenmodes trapped into the density holes in the solar wind. We present the theoretical study of such eigenmodes trapped into the density holes in the framework of the first Zakharov equation, where the prescribed density profile is supposed to be moving but static. We assign different 2 and 3 dimensional density holes, in the last case we consider the profiles having cylindrical symmetry and we analyze the eigenmode type solutions. We compare electric field envelope profiles with the observations of the S/WAVES experiment. We obtain the condition that relates the density hole depth with its characteristic spatial scales for the trapped wave mode to exist. It is similar to the Zakharov's condition that defines the threshold for nonlinearity to dominate over dispersion. The major consequence of this study consists in the conclusion that the role these wave modes can play in the process of the beam-plasma interaction is determined by the characteristics of the density fluctuations in the solar wind. They can be important if the probability of the occurrence of density fluctuations satisfying the condition for the wave trapping is large enough. [1] Ergun, R., et al., Eigenmode Structure in Solar-Wind Langmuir Waves, PRL 101, 051101 (2008), Experimental high pressure studies are extremely important to planetary science, material science and to the development of condensed matter theory. With experimental difficulties in creating the extreme pressure temperature conditions appropriate to planetary interiors, the approach used is to obtain the thermodynamic data on materials of interest by extrapolating the condensed matter theory which has been benchmarked with the outcome of high pressure experiments to the available high pressures. However the high pressure data used to match the theory heavily depends on the use of pressure media; like ethanol-methanol, silicon oil, argon and helium. Unfortunately still there exist controversy in the literature even with the use of helium as pressure medium as illustrated by the unsettled debate on Zn and Os among different groups. We have measured the equation of state of intermetallic compound AuIn2 and Cd0.8Hg0.2 alloy using ethanol-methanol and argon to the pressure of 20 GPa to confirm the appearance of anomalies in the data due to occurrence of subtle electronic phase transitions. However these anomalies can also be attributed to oriented lattice strains and local non-hydrostatic conditions. We have tried to remove these at room temperature by stabilizing the sample in argon medium in the diamond anvil cell with proper annealing as indicated by the uniformity of the pressure across the sample by ruby fluorescence measurements. We will present the data revealing the electronic transition in AuIn2 at 2.7 GPa and in Cd0.8Hg0.2 near 9 and 18 GPa., Cassini observations have found that the plasma and magnetic field conditions upstream of Titan are far more complex than they were thought to be after the Voyager encounter. Understanding the effects of the variable upstream conditions on Titan's plasma interaction and the evolution of Titan's ionosphere/atmosphere is one of the main objectives of the Cassini mission. To compliment the mission we perform hybrid simulations of Titan's plasma interaction to examine the effects of the incident plasma distribution function and the angle between the magnetic field and the flow velocity. We closely examine the results on Titan's induced magnetosphere and the resulting pickup ion properties., The discovery of lightning on several gas giants and Venus has captured the imagination of both the public and the scientific community, representing the most dramatic and visible evidence of the ubiquitous nature of atmospheric electrical phenomena in extraterrestrial environments. Small solid bodies with little or no atmosphere are also likely to exhibit active, dynamic electrical phenomena. Here we discuss the Earth's Moon as an example system where electrical effects arise due to the direct action of solar and plasma inputs at the surface. We show data from the Lunar Prospector mission that directly reveal variations in the surface potential of the Moon as a function of solar and plasma conditions, as the solar wind, UV, lunar wake, and the magnetosphere all contribute to the overall current balance at the lunar surface. As with planetary lightning, the extreme events are of special interest, and the Moon is no exception. Rather than resulting from atmospheric disturbances, the Moon's electrical ""storms"" arise from solar events such as coronal mass ejections, and during interactions with the Earth's geotail. We discuss the implications of lunar surface charging for dust electrification and transport, the dynamics of neutrals and ions, and the potential impact of these processes on the exploration of the surface. As we learn more about the electrical environment at the Moon, we may gain important insights into the detailed physical processes that influence surface charging on other airless bodies as well, such as Mercury, asteroids, and the moons of the outer planets., K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar geochronologists use the isotopic composition of atmospheric argon to correct for non-radiogenic 40Ar and to determine instrumental mass discrimination, among other purposes. The currently accepted atmospheric composition is based on measurements of Nier (1950), as filtered by Steiger and Jager (1977). A redetermination of the 40Ar: 38Ar: 36Ar of atmospheric argon by Lee et al. (2006), with 40Ar/36Ar = 298.56 ±0.31 (1 σ here and throughout) compared with Nier's (1950) value of 296.0 ±0.7, offers a more precise and likely more accurate reference standard that should be adopted by the K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar communities. Adopting the revised atmospheric composition has little impact on most age calculations as changes resulting from the magnified atmospheric correction are exactly balanced by those from the adjusted mass discrimination correction, in cases where air aliquots are used to determine mass discrimination. More significant are the effects of modified discrimination on reactor-produced isotopes, though in most realistic cases the resulting age difference is a few thousand years or less. The Lee et al. (2006) data provide a more sensitive benchmark for evaluating both natural and experimental fractionation of argon isotopes. Non-atmospheric, isotopically light initial argon turns out to be widely manifest in volcanic ejecta in which 40Ar/36Ar vs. 38Ar/36Ar correlations appear to follow a kinetic mass fractionation trend. This phenomenon has been recognized for decades (e.g., Krummenacher, 1970; Matsumoto et al., 1989; Ozawa et al, 2006) but has somehow escaped notice of the broader community. New data presented here suggest that the most extreme fractionation occurs in silicic glasses (obsidians), in which we have measured initial 40Ar/36Ar (isochron intercept) and 38Ar/36Ar (unirradiated aliquots) as low as 271.38 ±3.00 and 0.18117 ±0.00055, respectively. We suggest that the data of Lee et al. (2006) be adopted as a new standard for geochronology, and that these data be implemented in efforts to better characterize instrumental mass discrimination and to understand argon isotope fractionation in nature. Krummenacher, D., 1970, Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 8: 109- 117; Lee, J.-Y., et al., 2006, Geochim. Cosmochim.

Lett. 36: 359-362., Although the quiet activity period surrounding the current solar minimum has prevailed since the launch of STEREO in October 2006, there have been at least 9 clear in-situ detections of ICMEs (Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections) by one or more spacecraft during the time the imagers were also operating. These observations provide unusually complete data sets for evaluating helio-longitude extent of the ICMEs and for identifying the probable solar cause(s) of the events. In this poster we present information on these ICMEs from the IMPACT and PLASTIC and ACE in-situ investigations, together with solar images from STEREO and SOHO that seem to capture the causative activity at the Sun. We find that even though the Sun was very quiet in '07-'08, with few active regions visible in GONG and SOHO magnetograms, there were numerous CME candidates that erupted through the near-equatorial helmet streamers. Most events could be identified with EUV disk activity as well as a coronagraph CME, even if the associated active region was very small or weak. Old cycle active regions, new and decayed, continued to maintain a warp in the large-scale helmet streamer belt that was a frequent site of the eruptions. However, the warp in the streamer belt may simply indicate that the active region(s) present is(are) sufficiently strong to affect the large scale quiet coronal field structure. Overall we see no gross differences between the solar activity and ICME causes during this and the previous solar activity minimum, when the Streamer belt was less warped due to the existence of stronger solar polar fields., Titan is immersed in the sub-corotating plasma environment in Saturn's outer magnetosphere. As it orbits Saturn, its sunlit face changes from a location on the upstream side (at Saturn dusk) to the downstream side (at Saturn dawn) of the plasma flow, thus the plasma interaction depends on Saturn Local Time. Earlier measurements at Saturn and Titan by Voyager provided initial information suggesting a Venus-like interaction with Titan's massive ionosphere. This was not surprising considering our early conceptions. It was also expected that Titan would occasionally leave the magnetosphere and be immersed in the magnetosheath and solar wind. Measurements with the Cassini MAPS instruments together with numerical simulations have taught us much more about the nature of the interaction, the properties of the ionosphere, and a little about Titan's interior. The particles and fields investigations found a dynamic and structured plasma environment at 20 Rs dominated by a time-varying radial component of the Kronian magnetic field. The composition of the incident plasma was not that of a Titan-derived nitrogen and hydrogen pickup ion torus, but rather a highly variable magnetospheric hydrogen ion population with contributions from water-derived heavy ions, including an important energetic component. During one low altitude flyby, Titan had recently moved into Saturn's magnetosheath, carrying with it the memory of Saturn's magnetic field embedded in its ionosphere. In general, the new measurements of the plasma interaction and the ionosphere reflect the great variability of the external conditions, together with that introduced by the changing relative incident plasma flow and Sun angles. We provide an overview of some of these observational results, together with modeling efforts that are sorting out aspects of the complicated Titan-plasma interaction that Cassini has revealed., The electron mean free path in the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters is much larger than the gyroradius; thus, heat is transported anisotropically along magnetic field lines. We show that the intracluster medium is unstable to the magnetothermal instability (MTI) where the temperature declines with radius using MHD simulations with anisotropic thermal conduction. As a result of the MTI, we find that the temperature profile of the ICM can be substantially modified on timescales of several billion years, while the magnetic field is amplified by dynamo action up to more than 50 times the original energy. We also show that the instability drives field lines to become preferentially radial, leading to conduction that is a highly efficient fraction of the Spitzer conductivity., The Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) mission is a NASA Medium-class Explorer (MIDEX) mission, launched on February 17, 2007. The mission employs five identical micro-satellites, or “probes,” which line-up along the Earth’s magnetotail every four days in conjunctions to determine the trigger and large-scale evolution of magnetic substorms. The probes are equipped with a comprehensive suite of instruments that measure and track the motion of thermal and super-thermal ions and electrons, and electric and magnetic fields, at key regions in the magnetosphere. Primary science objectives require high data rates at periods of scientific interest, large data volumes, and control of science data collection on suborbital time scales. A central Instrument Data Processing Unit (IDPU) is necessary to organize and prioritize the data from the large number of instruments into a 200 MB solid state memory. The large data volume produced by the instruments requires a flexible memory capable of both high resolution snapshots during conjunctions and coarser survey data collection throughout the orbit. Onboard triggering algorithms select and prioritize the snapshots based on data quality to optimize the science data that is returned to the ground. This paper presents a detailed discussion of the hardware and software design of the THEMIS IDPU, describing the heritage design that has been fundamental to the THEMIS mission success so far., The design, performance, and on-orbit operation of the three-axis electric field instrument (EFI) for the NASA THEMIS mission is described. The 20 radial wire boom and 10 axial stacer boom antenna systems making up the EFI sensors on the five THEMIS spacecraft, along with their supporting electronics have been deployed and are operating successfully on-orbit without any mechanical or electrical failures since early 2007. The EFI provides for waveform and spectral three-axis measurements of the ambient electric field from DC up to 8 kHz, with a single, integral broadband channel extending up to 400 kHz. Individual sensor potentials are also measured, providing for on-board and ground-based estimation of spacecraft floating potential and high-resolution plasma density measurements. Individual antenna baselines are 50- and 40-m in the spin plane, and 6.9-m along the spin axis. The EFI has provided for critical observations supporting a clear and definitive understanding of the electrodynamics of both the boundaries of the terrestrial magnetosphere, as well as internal processes, such as relativistic particle acceleration and substorm dynamics. Such multi-point electric field observations are key for pushing forward the understanding of electrodynamics in space, in that without high-quality estimates of the electric field, the underlying electromagnetic processes involved in current sheets, reconnection, and wave-particle interactions may only be inferred, rather than measured, quantified, and used to discriminate between competing hypotheses regarding those processes., In 2007, the STE (SupraThermal Electron) sensors of the IMPACT instrument suite on the STEREO A and B spacecraft detected ~4-20 keV ENAs, most likely hydrogen, coming from the nose of heliosphere, with a wide (~60° in longitude), asymmetric double-peak source structure. These ENAs very likely originated from termination-shock-accelerated pickup ions in the heliosheath. Here we report on new STEREO A observations of heliosheath ENAs in 2008, a year later. We find generally the same ENA source structure - an asymmetric double peak straddling the nose of heliosphere, with the two peaks located at virtually same longitudes with comparable fluxes, on average. The observed ENA flux spectra also exhibit a similar double-power-law with a break at ~9-14 keV. Compared to 2007, the average ENA fluxes are almost the same in the direction of Voyage 1 (close to the major peak), while lower by a factor up to 2 in the direction of Voyager 2 (at the edge of ENA source). These observations indicate a rather steady ENA source in the heliosheath over a year, from 2007 to 2008. If the source is pickup ions accelerated at the termination shock, then their acceleration is quite stable. Furthermore, we will present STEREO B observations that are being taken in the next few months., The sizes and shapes of the stars o Ceti and R Leonis have been measured in the mid-infrared. The observations were made using the UC Berkeley Infrared Spatial Interferometer (ISI), and they reveal details about the size, shape and asymmetry of both stars over several epochs in 2006. The star o Ceti appears to be rather symmetric, while the shape of R Leonis appears more consistent with a uniform disk plus a point source that provides approximately 9% additional intensity somewhere in the southern half of the star., Recent work has suggested a surprising new upper bound on the lifetime of de Sitter vacua in string theory. The bound is parametrically longer than the Hubble time but parametrically shorter than the recurrence time. We investigate whether the bound is satisfied in a particular class of de Sitter solutions, the KKLT vacua. Despite the freedom to make the supersymmetry breaking scale exponentially small, which naively would lead to extremely stable vacua, we find that the lifetime is always less than about exp(10<SUP>22</SUP>) Hubble times, in agreement with the proposed bound. This result, however, is contingent on several estimates and assumptions; in particular, we rely on a conjectural upper bound on the Euler number of the Calabi-Yau fourfolds used in KKLT compactifications., According to astrophysical theory, magnetic fields should play an important role in the structure and dynamics of the interstellar medium. While astronomical observations confirm this directly, the observational record is sparse. This is because magnetic fields can only be measured via polarimetric methods, and most of these methods can only provide an indirect inference of the magnetic field strength. The Zeeman effect, however, is the only method by which in situ measurements of astrophysical magnetic fields can be made. <P />The spectral signature of Zeeman splitting is imprinted in the circular polarization spectrum of radiation received from an astronomical source. In order to make a reliable detection at radio frequencies, one must employ careful calibrations and account for instrumental effects. We begin this dissertation by covering the fundamentals of radio spectropolarimetry. We then offer historical details regarding the Zeeman effect and its use in single-dish radio observations. We present an outline of how one accurately measures the Zeeman effect using large single-dish radio telescopes. We follow this with results from an assessment of the polarization properties of the 100 m Green Bank Telescope (GBT). <P />We then present magnetic field detections made via the Zeeman effect from the Galactic scale to cosmological distances. We begin with GBT observations of 21 cm emission toward the Taurus Molecular Cloud (TMC) complex. Recent observations have suggested that fields stronger than 20 mG are located at the distance of the TMC. Our Zeeman observations rule out fields of this strength, but do show a clear ~+5 mG detection from H I emission at the velocity of the TMC. More surprisingly, we have discovered multiple detections of a line-of- sight magnetic field of strength ~+40 mG in a filament near -50 km s -1 . We then present a windfall of detections of milligauss-strength magnetic fields in starburst galaxies. Detected by means of Zeeman splitting of 1667 MHz hydroxyl megamaser emission, these Arecibo and GBT results represent the first extragalactic Zeeman measurements to probe the field inside an external galaxy. Finally, we climb the cosmological distance ladder, and present a dramatic GBT detection of a magnetic field in a damped Lya absorber at a redshift of 0.692. We discuss possible scenarios for the creation of an 84 mG field at a look-back time of 6.4 Gyr., Early observations by the THEMIS ESA plasma instrument have revealed new details of the dayside magnetosphere. As an introduction to THEMIS plasma data, this paper presents observations of plasmaspheric plumes, ionospheric ion outflows, field line resonances, structure at the low latitude boundary layer, flux transfer events at the magnetopause, and wave and particle interactions at the bow shock. These observations demonstrate the capabilities of the plasma sensors and the synergy of its measurements with the other THEMIS experiments. In addition, the paper includes discussions of various performance issues with the ESA instrument such as sources of sensor background, measurement limitations, and data formatting problems. These initial results demonstrate successful achievement of all measurement objectives for the plasma instrument., In this coordinated ground and space study, we report multiprobe measurements from Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS), LANL-97A, Polar, and ground observatories for a substorm that occurred on 23 March 2007. The THEMIS fleet and LANL-97A were located in the premidnight, near-Earth plasma sheet in the radial range from 6.6 to 13 R<SUB>E</SUB>, placing the spacecraft into different plasma environments which were subject to different activities. Simultaneous global Polar Ultraviolet Imager images of the aurora revealed a fine structure in the auroral bulge in the form of several time-delayed regions of brightening. We demonstrate a correspondence between this fine structure and the spatially separated plasma sheet activities (substorm injections with energies &gt;100 keV) by showing that both executed periodic (100-150 s) one-to-one correlated modulations. Additionally, the different auroral brightening regions were modulated approximately out of phase to one another, as were the separated plasma sheet activities. The periodic plasma sheet and optical modulations were also one-to-one correlated with large-amplitude (δH ∼ 150 nT) ground Pi2 pulsations. In contrast to the most energetic ions (&gt;100 keV), the lower-energetic plasma sheet ions executed separate oscillations during the development of the substorm, including the preintensification phase, and showed the following properties. (1) The oscillation periods were different at different spacecraft locations and had a tendency to increase during the evolution of the substorm. During the preintensification phase, multiple (possibly harmonic) spectral components existed. (2) The oscillations were coupled to westward moving perturbations of an energized plasma boundary. The boundary perturbations were likely conjugate to azimuthally spaced auroral forms (""beads"") observed by Polar-UVI during the preintensification phase and could play a role in the onset of the substorm intensification. (3) The oscillations of the lower-energetic ions were also one-to-one correlated with smaller-amplitude ground Pi2 pulsations (&lt;15 nT). In conclusion, the combination of these observations allowed us to construct a 3-D picture of low-frequency, near-Earth plasma sheet phenomena associated with a substorm and their connection to aurora and the ground. It appeared that not only one substorm current wedge, but additional current structures existed which started at different times, pulsated out of phase, and mapped from different active regions into the ionosphere. The active space regions appeared to be coupled and transferring energy from one region to the other while pulsating. We propose that the wave-like structures in the plasma sheet, observed before and during the substorm/intensification phase, and their demonstrated properties support a wave phenomenon (such as a ballooning-type mode) for the onset and development of the substorm/intensification, rather than directly driven periodic bursty bulk flow activations., The NASA Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) project is intended to investigate magnetospheric substorm phenomena, which are the manifestations of a basic instability of the magnetosphere and a dominant mechanism of plasma transport and explosive energy release. The major controversy in substorm science is the uncertainty as to whether the instability is initiated near the Earth, or in the more distant &gt;20 Re magnetic tail. THEMIS will discriminate between the two possibilities by using five in-situ satellites and ground-based all-sky imagers and magnetometers, and inferring the propagation direction by timing the observation of the substorm initiation at multiple locations in the magnetosphere. An array of stations, consisting of 20 all-sky imagers (ASIs) and 30-plus magnetometers, has been developed and deployed in the North American continent, from Alaska to Labrador, for the broad coverage of the nightside magnetosphere. Each ground-based observatory (GBO) contains a white light imager that takes auroral images at a 3-second repetition rate (“cadence”) and a magnetometer that records the 3 axis variation of the magnetic field at 2 Hz frequency. The stations return compressed images, “thumbnails,” to two central databases: one located at UC Berkeley and the other at the University of Calgary, Canada. The full images are recorded at each station on hard drives, and these devices are physically returned to the two data centers for data copying. All data are made available for public use by scientists in “browse products,” accessible by using internet browsers or in the form of downloadable CDF data files (the “browse products” are described in detail in a later section). Twenty all-sky imager stations are installed and running at the time of this publication. An example of a substorm was observed on the 23rd of December 2006, and from the THEMIS GBO data, we found that the substorm onset brightening of the equatorward arc was a gradual process (&gt;27 seconds), with minimal morphology changes until the arc breaks up. The breakup was timed to the nearest frame (&lt;3 s) and located to the nearest latitude degree at about ±3<SUP>o</SUP>E in longitude. The data also showed that a similar breakup occurred in Alaska ∼10 minutes later, highlighting the need for an array to distinguish prime onset., Accurate knowledge of the telescope’s point-spread function (PSF) is essential for the weak gravitational lensing measurements that hold great promise for cosmological constraints. For space telescopes, the PSF may vary with time due to thermal drifts in the telescope structure, and/or due to jitter in the spacecraft pointing (ground-based telescopes have additional sources of variation). We describe and simulate a procedure for using the images of the stars in each exposure to determine the misalignment and jitter parameters, and reconstruct the PSF at any point in that exposure’s field of view. As a case study, the simulation uses the design of the Supernova Acceleration Probe (SNAP) telescope. Stellar-image data in a typical exposure determines secondary-mirror positions as precisely as 20 nm. The PSF ellipticities and size, which are the quantities of interest for weak lensing are determined to 4.0 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> and 2.2 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> accuracies, respectively, in each exposure, sufficient to meet weak-lensing requirements. We show that, for the case of a space telescope, the PSF estimation errors scale inversely with the square root of the total number of photons collected from all the usable stars in the exposure., We present a single epoch of high signal-to-noise ratio spectropolarimetry of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2004S taken 9 days after maximum light. The flux spectrum is normal, but with the additional presence of high-velocity (HV) line features in both Ca II and Fe II. The object shows continuum polarization at the 0.4% level in the red, a value which appears to be typical of SNe Ia. The continuum data are consistent with a ~10% global asphericity in an axisymmetric geometry. Unlike previous observations of other SNe Ia with HV features, the HV features in SN 2004S show no strong polarimetric signature, though this may be due to the timing of our observations. Instead, the object shows line-polarization features (P &lt;= 0.5%) that are rotated with respect to the axis of symmetry of the continuum. The line features are visible in Si II, Fe II, and Ca II, and appear to be narrowly confined in velocity space just above the photosphere. These polarization features are a result of compositional inhomogeneities in the ejecta. They may represent newly synthesized elements whose clumpy spatial distribution within the ejecta is distinct from that of the globally aspherical ejecta as a whole., The biggest halo coronal mass ejection (CME) since the Halloween storm in 2003, which occurred on 2006 December 13, is studied in terms of its solar source and heliospheric consequences. The CME was accompanied by an X3.4 flare, EUV dimmings, and coronal waves. It generated significant space weather effects such as an interplanetary shock, radio bursts, major solar energetic particle (SEP) events, and a magnetic cloud (MC) that were detected by a fleet of spacecraft including STEREO, ACE, WIND, and Ulysses. Reconstruction of the MC with the Grad-Shafranov (GS) method yields an axis orientation oblique to the flare ribbons. Observations of the SEP intensities and anisotropies show that the particles can be trapped, deflected, and reaccelerated by the large-scale transient structures. The CME-driven shock was observed at both the Earth and Ulysses when they were separated by 74° in latitude and 117° in longitude, which is the largest shock extent ever detected. The ejecta seem to have been missed at Ulysses. The shock arrival time at Ulysses is well predicted by an MHD model that can propagate the 1 AU data outward. The CME/shock is tracked remarkably well from the Sun all the way to Ulysses by coronagraph images, type II frequency drift, in situ measurements, and the MHD model. These results reveal a technique that combines MHD propagation of the solar wind and type II emissions to predict the shock arrival time at the Earth, which is a significant advance for space weather forecasting, especially when in situ data become available from the Solar Orbiter and Solar Sentinels., In Paper I, we introduced and tested a method for predicting solar active region coronal emissions using magnetic field measurements and a chosen heating relationship. Here, we apply this forward-modeling technique to 10 active regions observed with the Mees Solar Observatory Imaging Vector Magnetograph and the Yohkoh Soft X-ray Telescope. We produce synthetic images of each region using four parameterized heating relationships depending on magnetic field strength and geometry. We find a volumetric coronal heating rate (dE<SUB>H</SUB>/dV, not to be confused with dE<SUB>H</SUB>/dA quoted by some authors) proportional to magnetic field and inversely proportional to field-line loop length (BL<SUP>-1</SUP>) best matches observed coronal emission morphologies. This parameterization is most similar to the steady-state scaling of two proposed heating mechanisms: van Ballegooijen's ""current layers"" theory, taken in the AC limit, and Parker's ""critical angle"" mechanism, in the case where the angle of misalignment is a twist angle. Although this parameterization best matches the observations, it does not match well enough to make a definitive statement as to the nature of coronal heating. Instead, we conclude that (1) the technique requires better magnetic field measurement and extrapolation techniques than currently available, and (2) forward-modeling methods that incorporate properties of transiently heated loops are necessary to make a more conclusive statement about coronal heating mechanisms., We present multi-epoch spectral and spectropolarimetric observations of the Type IIn supernova (SN) 1997eg that indicate the presence of a flattened disklike concentration of circumstellar material surrounding aspherical ejecta, with which the disk is misaligned. The polarization across the broad Hα, Hβ, and He I λ5876 lines of SN 1997eg forms closed loops when viewed in the Stokes q-u plane. Such loops occur when the geometrical symmetry of one or both of the Stokes parameters across spectral lines is broken, in this case most likely by occultation of the ejecta by the equatorial circumstellar matter concentration. The polarization of the narrow Balmer lines possesses an intrinsic axis that differs by 12° from that of the elongated ejecta and probably indicates the orientation of the disklike circumstellar material. The existence of two different axes of symmetry in SN 1997eg suggests that neither rotation of the progenitor nor the influence of a companion star can be the sole mechanism creating a preferred axis within the supernova system. Our model supports the emerging hypothesis that the progenitors of some Type IIn supernovae are luminous blue variable stars, whose presupernova mass eruptions form the circumstellar shells that physically characterize the SN IIn subclass. These conclusions, which are independent of interstellar polarization effects, would have been unobservable with only a single epoch of spectropolarimetry., The optical afterglow of long-duration GRB 071003 is among the brightest yet to be detected from any GRB, with R ≈ 12 mag in KAIT observations starting 42 s after the GRB trigger, including filtered detections during prompt emission. However, our high-S/N afterglow spectrum displays only extremely weak absorption lines at what we argue is the host redshift of z = 1.60435, in contrast to the three other, much stronger Mg II absorption systems observed at lower redshifts. Together with Keck adaptive optics observations, which fail to reveal a host galaxy coincident with the burst position, our observations suggest a halo progenitor and offer a cautionary tale about the use of Mg II for GRB redshift determination. We present early- through late-time observations spanning the electromagnetic spectrum, constrain the connection between the prompt emission and early variations in the light curve (we observe no correlation), and discuss possible origins for an unusual, marked rebrightening that occurs a few hours after the burst: likely either a late-time refreshed shock or a wide-angle secondary jet. Analysis of the late-time afterglow is most consistent with a wind environment, suggesting a massive star progenitor. Together with GRB 070125, this may indicate that a small but significant portion of star formation in the early universe occurred far outside what we consider a normal galactic disk., A new generation of radio telescopes is achieving unprecedented levels of sensitivity and resolution, as well as increased agility and field of view, by employing high-performance digital signal-processing hardware to phase and correlate signals from large numbers of antennas. The computational demands of these imaging systems scale in proportion to BMN <SUP>2</SUP>, where B is the signal bandwidth, M is the number of independent beams, and N is the number of antennas. The specifications of many new arrays lead to demands in excess of tens of PetaOps per second. To meet this challenge, we have developed a general-purpose correlator architecture using standard 10-Gbit Ethernet switches to pass data between flexible hardware modules containing Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chips. These chips are programmed using open-source signal-processing libraries that we have developed to be flexible, scalable, and chip-independent. This work reduces the time and cost of implementing a wide range of signal-processing systems, with correlators foremost among them, and facilitates upgrading to new generations of processing technology. We present several correlator deployments, including a 16-antenna, 200-MHz bandwidth, 4-bit, full-Stokes parameter application deployed on the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization., Recent measurements of high-redshift quasar (QSO) clustering from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey indicate that QSOs at z ~ 4 have a bias &lt;b&gt; ~= 14. We find that this extremely high clustering amplitude, combined with the corresponding space density, constrains the dispersion in the L-M<SUB>h</SUB> relation to be less than 50per cent at 99per cent confidence for the most conservative case of a 100per cent duty cycle. This upper limit to the intrinsic dispersion provides as strong a constraint as current upper limits to the intrinsic dispersion in the local M<SUB>BH</SUB>-σ relation and the ratio of bolometric to Eddington luminosity of luminous QSOs., Hydrogen-helium mixtures at conditions of Jupiter's interior are studied with first-principles computer simulations. The resulting equation of state (EOS) implies that Jupiter possesses a central core of 14-18 Earth masses of heavier elements, a result that supports core accretion as the standard model for the formation of hydrogen-rich giant planets. Our nominal model has about 4 Earth masses of planetary ices in the H-He-rich mantle, a result that is, within a modeling uncertainty of 6 Earth masses, consistent with abundances measured by the 1995 Galileo entry probe mission, suggesting that the composition found by the probe may be representative of the entire planet. Interior models derived from this first-principles EOS do not give a match to Jupiter's gravity moment J<SUB>4</SUB> unless one invokes interior differential rotation, implying that Jovian interior dynamics has an observable effect on the high-order gravity field., Fomalhaut, a bright star 7.7 parsecs (25 light-years) from Earth, harbors a belt of cold dust with a structure consistent with gravitational sculpting by an orbiting planet. Here, we present optical observations of an exoplanet candidate, Fomalhaut b. Fomalhaut b lies about 119 astronomical units (AU) from the star and 18 AU of the dust belt, matching predictions of its location. Hubble Space Telescope observations separated by 1.73 years reveal counterclockwise orbital motion. Dynamical models of the interaction between the planet and the belt indicate that the planet’s mass is at most three times that of Jupiter; a higher mass would lead to gravitational disruption of the belt, matching predictions of its location. The flux detected at 0.8 μm is also consistent with that of a planet with mass no greater than a few times that of Jupiter. The brightness at 0.6 μm and the lack of detection at longer wavelengths suggest that the detected flux may include starlight reflected off a circumplanetary disk, with dimension comparable to the orbits of the Galilean satellites. We also observe variability of unknown origin at 0.6 μm., We compute χ values for blue emission lines in active M dwarfs. Using flux-calibrated spectra from nearby M dwarfs and spectral M dwarf templates from SDSS, we derive analytical relations that describe how the χ values for the Ca II H and K as well as the Hβ, Hγ, Hδ, Hɛ, and H8 Balmer emission lines vary as a function of spectral type and color. These derived values are important for numerous M dwarf studies where the intrinsic luminosity of emission lines cannot be estimated due to uncertain distances and/or non-flux-calibrated spectra. We use these results to estimate the mean properties of blue emission lines in active-field M dwarfs from SDSS., Scalar field dark energy evolving from a long radiation- or matter-dominated epoch has characteristic dynamics. While slow-roll approximations are invalid, a well defined field expansion captures the key aspects of the dark energy evolution during much of the matter-dominated epoch. Since this behavior is determined, it is not faithfully represented if priors for dynamical quantities are chosen randomly. We demonstrate these features for both thawing and freezing fields, and for some modified gravity models, and unify several special cases from the literature., Chloroform (trichloromethane, CHCl<SUB>3</SUB>) is the second largest carrier of natural chlorine in the troposphere after methyl chloride, contributing to the reactive chlorine burden in the troposphere and to ozone destruction in the stratosphere. Here we report CHCl<SUB>3</SUB> flux measurements from coastal and interior tundra sites in northern Alaska, showing that the Arctic tundra can contribute substantial amounts of CHCl<SUB>3</SUB> to the atmosphere. Emissions were measured during the 2005 and 2006 growing seasons over a range of vegetation types and hydrologic conditions, from wet sedge coastal to upland tussock tundra. Overall emissions averaged 45 nmol m<SUP>-2</SUP> d<SUP>-1</SUP>, but fluxes were highly variable, ranging from &lt;1 up to 260 nmol m<SUP>-2</SUP> d<SUP>-1</SUP>, with the highest emissions from moist tundra. Laboratory soil core incubations show that flooded conditions sharply reduce emission rates. A rough extrapolation suggests that the tundra globally could account for 1-2% of the total estimated source of atmospheric CHCl<SUB>3</SUB>., We present Hα integral field spectroscopy of well-resolved, UV/optically selected z ~ 2 star-forming galaxies as part of the SINS survey with SINFONI on the ESO VLT. Our laser guide star adaptive optics and good seeing data show the presence of turbulent rotating star-forming outer rings/disks, plus central bulge/inner disk components, whose mass fractions relative to the total dynamical mass appear to scale with the [N II]/Hα flux ratio and the star formation age. We propose that the buildup of the central disks and bulges of massive galaxies at z ~ 2 can be driven by the early secular evolution of gas-rich proto-disks. High-redshift disks exhibit large random motions. This turbulence may in part be stirred up by the release of gravitational energy in the rapid ""cold"" accretion flows along the filaments of the cosmic web. As a result, dynamical friction and viscous processes proceed on a timescale of &lt;1 Gyr, at least an order of magnitude faster than in z ~ 0 disk galaxies. Early secular evolution thus drives gas and stars into the central regions and can build up exponential disks and massive bulges, even without major mergers. Secular evolution along with increased efficiency of star formation at high surface densities may also help to account for the short timescales of the stellar buildup observed in massive galaxies at z ~ 2. <P />Based on observations at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) of the European Southern Observatory (ESO), Paranal, Chile., Tomographic inversions for large-scale structure of the earth's mantle involve a forward modelling step of wave propagation through 3-D heterogeneity. Until now, most investigators have worked in the framework of the simplest theoretical assumptions, namely the infinite frequency `ray theory' in the case of body wave traveltime inversions, or the `path-average' approximation (PAVA) to normal mode perturbation theory, in the case of surface waves and long-period waveforms. As interest is shifting to mapping shorter wavelength structures, the need for a more accurate theoretical account of the interaction of seismic waves with mantle heterogeneity, coupled with improvements in path coverage, has been realized. <P />Here we discuss different levels of approximations used in the context of normal mode perturbation theory, when modelling time domain seismic waveforms. We compare the performance of asymptotic approximations, which collapse the effects of 3-D structure onto the great circle vertical plane: the 1-D PAVA and a 2-D approximation called non-linear asymptotic coupling theory (NACT), which both are zeroth order asymptotic approximations. We then discuss how off-vertical plane effects can be introduced using higher order asymptotics. These computationally efficient approximations are compared to the linear Born formalism (BORN), which computes scattering integrals over the entire surface of the sphere. We point out some limitations of this linear formalism in the case of spatially extended anomalies, and show how that can be remedied through the introduction of a non-linear term (NBORN). All these approximations are referenced to a precise 3-D numerical computation afforded by the spectral element method. We discuss simple geometries, and explore a range of sizes of anomalies compared to the wavelength of the seismic waves considered, thus illustrating the range of validity and limitations of the various approximations considered., Spectrally resolved scattering of ultrafast K-α x-rays has provided experimental validation of the modeling of the compression and heating of shocked matter. The elastic scattering component has characterized the evolution and coalescence of two shocks launched by a nanosecond laser pulse into lithium hydride with an unprecedented temporal resolution of 10 picoseconds. At shock coalescence, we observed rapid heating to temperatures of 25,000 kelvin when the scattering spectra show the collective plasmon oscillations that indicate the transition to the dense metallic plasma state. The plasmon frequency determines the material compression, which is found to be a factor of 3, thereby reaching conditions in the laboratory relevant for studying the physics of planetary formation., The shape of the Sun subtly reflects its rotation and internal flows. The surface rotation rate, ~2 kilometers per second at the equator, predicts an oblateness (equator-pole radius difference) of 7.8 milli arc seconds, or ~0.001%. Observations from the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager satellite show unexpectedly large flattening, relative to the expectation from surface rotation. This excess is dominated by the quadrupole term and gives a total oblateness of 10.77 ± 0.44 milli arc seconds. The position of the limb correlates with a sensitive extreme ultraviolet proxy, the 284 angstrom limb brightness. We relate the larger radius values to magnetic elements in the enhanced network and use the correlation to correct for it as a systematic error term in the oblateness measurement. The corrected oblateness of the nonmagnetic Sun is 8.01 ± 0.14 milli arc seconds, which is near the value expected from rotation., Molecular clouds are observed to be turbulent, but the origin of this turbulence is not well understood. As a result, there are two different approaches to simulating molecular clouds, one in which the turbulence is allowed to decay after it is initialized, and one in which it is driven. We use the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code, Orion, to perform high-resolution simulations of molecular cloud cores and protostars in environments with both driven and decaying turbulence. We include self-gravity, use a barotropic equation of state, and represent regions exceeding the maximum grid resolution with sink particles. We analyze the properties of bound cores such as size, shape, line width, and rotational energy, and we find reasonable agreement with observation. At high resolution the different rates of core accretion in the two cases have a significant effect on protostellar system development. Clumps forming in a decaying turbulence environment produce high-multiplicity protostellar systems with Toomre Q unstable disks that exhibit characteristics of the competitive accretion model for star formation. In contrast, cores forming in the context of continuously driven turbulence and virial equilibrium form smaller protostellar systems with fewer low-mass members. Our simulations of driven and decaying turbulence show some statistically significant differences, particularly in the production of brown dwarfs and core rotation, but the uncertainties are large enough that we are not able to conclude whether observations favor one or the other., Exploring the diversity of dark energy dynamics, we discover a calibration relation, a uniform stretching of the amplitude of the equation of state time variation with scale factor. This defines homogeneous families of dark energy physics. The calibration factor has a close relation to the standard time variation parameter w<SUB>a</SUB>, and we show that the new, calibrated w<SUB>a</SUB> describes observables, i.e. distance and Hubble parameter as a function of redshift, typically to an accuracy level of 10<SUP>-3</SUP>. We discuss implications for figures of merit for dark energy science programs., Owing to its extremely high luminosity and long duration, supernova (SN) 2006gy radiated more energy in visual light than any other known SN. Two hypotheses to explain its high luminosity at early times—that it was powered by shock interaction with circumstellar material (CSM) as implied by its Type IIn spectrum, or that it was fueled by radioactive decay from a large mass of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni synthesized in a pair-instability SN—predicted different late-time properties. Here we present observations of SN 2006gy obtained more than a year after discovery. We were unable to detect it at visual wavelengths, but clear near-infrared (IR) K<SUP>'</SUP> and H-band detections show that it is still at least as luminous as the peak of a normal Type II SN. We also present spectra giving an upper limit to the late-time Hα luminosity of lesssim10<SUP>39</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Based on the weak late-time Hα, X-ray, and radio emission, combined with the difficulty of explaining the shift to IR wavelengths, we can rule out ongoing CSM interaction as the primary late-time power source of SN 2006gy. Instead, we propose that the evolution of SN 2006gy is consistent with one of two possible scenarios: (1) a pair-instability SN plus modest CSM interaction, where the radioactive decay luminosity shifts to the IR because of dust formation; or (2) an IR echo, where radiation emitted during peak luminosity heats a pre-existing dust shell at radii near 1 light year, requiring the progenitor star to have ejected another shell of ~10 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> about 1500 yr before the SN., GRIPS is an envisioned space telescope for Gamma-Ray burst Investigation via Polarimetry and Spectroscopy. It will be capable of imaging gamma rays in the energy range from roughly 200 keV up to at least 50 MeV via Compton scattering and pair creation. <P />GRIPS will also provide unprecedented sensitivities for nuclear-line science. With a field-of-view of roughly 50° HWHM, energy resolutions of ∼5% FWHM at 511 keV and ∼2% at 1809 keV, angular resolutions of 3.3° at 511 keV and 1.4° at 1809 keV, and effective areas after background cuts of ∼450 cm<SUP>2</SUP> at 511 keV and ∼200 cm<SUP>2</SUP> at 1809 keV, GRIPS will achieve all-sky narrow-line point-source sensitivities of 9 × 10<SUP>-6</SUP> ph/cm<SUP>2</SUP>/s for 511 keV and 4 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> ph/cm<SUP>2</SUP>/s at 1809 keV after five years mission time., We study the effects of anisotropic thermal conduction on magnetized spherical accretion flows using global axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. In low-collisionality plasmas, the Bondi spherical accretion solution is unstable to the magnetothermal instability (MTI). The MTI grows rapidly at large radii where the inflow is subsonic. For a weak initial field, the MTI saturates by creating a primarily radial magnetic field, i.e. by aligning the field lines with the background temperature gradient. The saturation is quasi-linear in the sense that the magnetic field is amplified by a factor of ~10-30 independent of the initial field strength (for weak fields). In the saturated state, the conductive heat flux is much larger than the convective heat flux, and is comparable to the field-free (Spitzer) value (since the field lines are largely radial). The MTI by itself does not appreciably change the accretion rate relative to the Bondi rate . However, the radial field lines created by the MTI are amplified by flux freezing as the plasma flows in to small radii. Oppositely directed field lines are brought together by the converging inflow, leading to significant resistive heating. When the magnetic energy density is comparable to the gravitational potential energy density, the plasma is heated to roughly the virial temperature; the mean inflow is highly subsonic; most of the energy released by accretion is transported to large radii by thermal conduction and the accretion rate . The predominantly radial magnetic field created by the MTI at large radii in spherical accretion flows may account for the stable Faraday rotation measure towards Sgr A* in the Galactic Centre., We present time-dependent models of the remnant accretion discs created during compact object mergers, focusing on the energy available from accretion at late times and the composition of the disc and its outflows. We calculate the dynamics near the outer edge of the disc, which contains the majority of the disc's mass and determines the accretion rate on to the central black hole. This treatment allows us to follow the evolution over much longer time-scales (100s or longer) than current hydrodynamic simulations. At late times the disc becomes advective and its properties asymptote to self-similar solutions with an accretion rate (neglecting outflows). This late-time accretion can in principle provide sufficient energy to power the late-time activity observed by Swift from some short-duration gamma-ray bursts. However, because outflows during the advective phase unbind the majority of the remaining mass, it is difficult for the remnant disc alone to produce significant accretion power well beyond the onset of the advective phase. Unless the viscosity is quite low (α &lt;~ 10<SUP>-3</SUP>), this occurs before the start of observed flaring at ~30s continued mass inflow at late times thus appears required to explain the late-time activity from short-duration gamma-ray bursts. We show that the composition of the disc freezes-out when the disc is relatively neutron rich (electron fraction Y<SUB>e</SUB> ~= 0.3). Roughly 10<SUP>-2</SUP>Msolar of this neutron-rich material is ejected by winds at late times. During earlier, neutrino-cooled phases of accretion, neutrino irradiation of the disc produces a wind with Y<SUB>e</SUB> ~= 0.5, which synthesizes at most ~10<SUP>-3</SUP>Msolar of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni. We highlight what conditions are favorable for <SUP>56</SUP>Ni production and predict, in the best cases, optical and infrared transients peaking ~0.5-2d after the burst, with fluxes a factor of ~10 below the current observational limits., We report on the results of observations of hard X-ray sources in the Galactic plane with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. The hard X-ray ""IGR"" sources were discovered by the INTEGRAL satellite, and the goals of the Chandra observations are to provide subarcsecond localizations to obtain optical and infrared counterparts and to provide constraints on their 0.3-10 keV spectra. We obtained relatively short, ~5 ks, observations for 20 IGR sources and find a bright Chandra source in INTEGRAL error circles in 12 cases. In 11 of these cases, a cross-correlation with optical and/or infrared source catalogs yields a counterpart, and the range of J-band magnitudes is 8.1-16.4. Also, in four cases, the Chandra X-ray spectra show evidence for absorbing material surrounding the compact object with a column density of local material in excess of 5 × 10<SUP>22</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. We confirm that IGR J00234+6141 is a cataclysmic variable and IGR J14515-5542 is an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We also confirm that IGR J06074+2205, IGR J10101-5654, IGR J11305-6256, and IGR J17200-3116 are high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs). Our results (along with follow-up optical spectroscopy reported elsewhere) indicate that IGR J11435-6109 is an HMXB and IGR J18259-0706 is an AGN. We find that IGR J09026-4812, IGR J18214-1318, and IGR J18325-0756 may be HMXBs. In cases where we do not find a Chandra counterpart, the flux upper limits place interesting constraints on the luminosities of black hole and neutron star X-ray transients in quiescence., SN 2006tf is the third most luminous supernova (SN) discovered so far, after SN 2005ap and SN 2006gy. SN 2006tf is valuable because it provides a link between two regimes: (1) luminous Type IIn supernovae powered by emission directly from interaction with circumstellar material (CSM), and (2) the most extremely luminous SNe where the CSM interaction is so optically thick that energy must diffuse out from an opaque shocked shell. As SN 2006tf evolves, it slowly transitions from the second to the first regime as the clumpy shell becomes more porous. This link suggests that the range in properties of the most luminous SNe is largely determined by the density and speed of hydrogen-rich material ejected shortly before they explode. The total energy radiated by SN 2006tf was at least 7 × 10<SUP>50</SUP> ergs. If the bulk of this luminosity came from the thermalization of shock kinetic energy, then the star needs to have ejected ~18 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> in the 4-8 yr before core collapse, and another 2-6 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> in the decades before that. A Type Ia explosion is therefore excluded. From the Hα emission-line profile, we derive a blast wave speed of 2000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> that does not decelerate, and from the narrow P Cygni absorption from preshock gas we deduce that the progenitor's wind speed was ~190 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. This is reminiscent of the wind speeds of luminous blue variables (LBVs), but not of red supergiants or Wolf-Rayet stars. We propose that like SN 2006gy, SN 2006tf marked the death of a very massive star that retained a hydrogen envelope until the end of its life and suffered extreme LBV-like mass loss in the decades before it exploded., We present the first detection and mapping of the HD 32297 debris disk at 1.3 mm with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA). With a subarcsecond beam, this detection represents the highest angular resolution (sub)mm debris disk observation made to date. Our model fits to the spectral energy distribution from the CARMA flux and new Spitzer MIPS photometry support the earlier suggestion that at least two, possibly three, distinct grain populations are traced by the current data. The observed millimeter map shows an asymmetry between the northeast and southwest disk lobes, suggesting large grains may be trapped in resonance with an unseen exoplanet. Alternatively, the observed morphology could result from the recent breakup of a massive planetesimal. A similar-scale asymmetry is also observed in scattered light but not in the mid-infrared. This contrast between asymmetry at short and long wavelengths and symmetry at intermediate wavelengths is in qualitative agreement with predictions of resonant debris disk models. With resolved observations in several bands spanning over three decades in wavelength, HD 32297 provides a unique test bed for theories of grain and planetary dynamics, and could potentially provide strong multiwavelength evidence for an exoplanetary system., We present a complete sample of International Ultraviolet Explorer and Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet (UV) spectra of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) through 2004. We measure the equivalent width (EW) and blueshifted velocity of the minimum of the one strong UV feature, Fe II λ3250. We also quantify the slope of the near-UV spectra using a new parameter, the ""UV ratio."" We find that the velocity of the Fe II line does not correlate with light-curve shape, while the EW shows distinct behavior for the slow- and fast-declining objects. Using precise Cepheid and surface brightness fluctuation distance measurements of six objects with UV spectra observed near maximum light (a total of 12 spectra), we determine that the UV ratio at maximum light is highly correlated with SN Ia luminosity. A larger sample of UV spectra is necessary to determine the validity of these luminosity indicators and whether they can be combined with light-curve shape to improve measured SN Ia distances., We investigate seven Monte Carlo algorithms - four old and three new - for constructing merger histories of dark matter haloes, using the extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism based on both the spherical and ellipsoidal collapse models. We compare, side-by-side, the algorithms' abilities at reproducing the analytic EPS conditional (or progenitor) mass function over a broad range of mass and redshift (z = 0 to 15). Among the four old algorithms (those by Lacey &amp; Cole, Kauffmann &amp; White, Somerville &amp; Kolatt and Cole et al.), we find that only the method of Kauffmann &amp; White produces a progenitor mass function that is consistent with the EPS prediction for all look-back redshifts. The origins of the discrepancies in the other three algorithms are discussed. Our three new algorithms are designed to generate the correct progenitor mass function at each time-step. We show that this is a necessary and sufficient condition for consistency with EPS at any look-back time. We illustrate the differences between the three new algorithms and the method of Kauffmann &amp; White one by investigating two other conditional statistics: the mass function of the i th most massive progenitors and the mass function for descendants with N<SUB>p</SUB> progenitors., In this paper we investigate the interplanetary drivers of the largest geomagnetically induced currents (GIC) during the solar cycle 23. Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are the major causes of intense geomagnetic storms and large GIC. In particular, in this work we examine the effectiveness of different structures embedded in an ICME (namely sheath regions, ejecta, and boundary layers) in causing large GIC. It was found that when an ICME interacts with the Earth's magnetosphere the most intense GIC activity is likely to take place during the passage of the turbulent sheath region. The effectiveness of sheath regions in driving large GIC is possibly due to their capability to trigger substorms and to drive intense directly driven ionospheric activity. We also investigated the relationships between different solar wind parameters and the GIC amplitudes. The best correlation with the GIC amplitudes was found with the solar wind electric field and the epsilon parameter. Ejecta-associated GIC seem to require an on-going magnetospheric Dst storm while sheath regions and boundary layers can cause large GIC even when no activity is taking place in terms of Dst. Interestingly, four of the nine ejecta-associated GIC took place during the recovery phases of a intense magnetic storm (but when Dst still was having storm time values below -50 nT)., We conducted a multi-wavelength observing campaign on Neptune between June and October, 2003. We used the 10-m Keck telescope at near- and mid-infrared wavelengths and the VLA at radio wavelengths. At mid-infrared and radio wavelengths the south polar region is relatively warm, which we interpret as being caused by global dynamics in Neptune's atmosphere: subsiding motions over the pole and the equator and rising at southern midlatitudes are qualitatively consistent all the observations., We present a large-scale effort of creating composite spectra of high-redshift SNe Ia and comparing them to low-redshift counterparts in an attempt to understand possible cosmic evolution of SNe Ia, which has major implications for studies of dark energy. Through the ESSENCE project, we have obtained 107 spectra of 88 high-redshift SNe Ia with excellent light-curve information. In addition, we have obtained 397 spectra of low-redshift SNe Ia through a multiple-decade effort at the Lick and Keck Observatories, and we have used 45 UV spectra obtained by HST and IUE. The low-redshift spectra act as a control sample when comparing to the ESSENCE spectra. In all instances, the ESSENCE and Lick composite spectra appear very similar. The addition of galaxy light to the Lick composite spectra allows an excellent match of the overall SED with the ESSENCE composite spectra, indicating that the high-redshift SNe are more contaminated with host galaxy light than their low-redshift counterparts. This is caused by observing objects at all redshifts with similar angular slit widths, which corresponds to different projected physical distances. After correcting for the galaxy light contamination, a few marginally significant differences in the spectra remain. We have estimated the systematic errors when using current spectral templates for K-corrections to be ~0.02 mag. The variance in the composite spectra gives an estimate of the intrinsic variance in low-redshift maximum light SN spectra of ~3% relative flux in the optical and growing toward the UV. The difference between the maximum light low- and high-redshift spectra constrains the evolution of SN spectral features between our samples to be &lt;10% relative flux in the rest-frame optical. Currently, galaxy contamination and the small samples of rest-frame UV spectra at low and high redshifts are the limiting factors for future studies., Jupiter is a strong source of radio emissions, as discovered in the early 1950s (Burke and Franklin, 1955). These first detections revealed emissions that were sporadic in character, and confined to frequencies less than 40 MHz. This component of the planet's radio emission is commonly referred to as decametric (DAM) radiation, and is attributed to electron cyclotron maser emission, emitted by keV electrons in Jupiter's auroral regions. All four giant planets and the Earth emit such radiation. To date these emissions have been studied in the timefrequency domain, since it has not been possible to image at these low frequencies. A new Low Frequency Array, LOFAR, is momentarily being build in the Netherlands. It consists of a low (~30-80 MHz) and high (~120-240 MHz) frequency band, with baselines between 100 m up to 100 km. By connecting (VLBI) with the Nancay radio telescope, baselines of 700 km can be achieved. This telescope complements the VLA (Very large Array) and ATA (Allen Telescope Array) in frequency coverage, and using the combined arrays (quasi)- simultaneously, Jupiter's radiation environment can be mapped from about 20 MHz (the low LOFAR band is still sensitive below 30 MHz, but with reduced through-put) up to 20 GHz. Jupiter emits both synchrotron and coherent cyclotron radiation at low frequencies (e.g., de Pater 2004; Zarka, 2004). Synchrotron radiation is emitted by relativistic electrons (MeV) trapped in Jupiter's radiation belts; this component of the emission has been imaged regularly at higher (&gt; 300 MHz) frequencies. Simultaneous high resolution imaging at low frequencies will help identify the origin and mode of transport of the synchrotron radiating electrons, including their source and loss terms. At frequencies below 40 MHz LOFAR could, for the first time ever, image Jupiter's decametric (DAM) emissions. These emissions have been observed since the early 1950's, and are characterized by complex, highly organized structures in the frequency-time domain, with typical timescales varying from milliseconds to hours. The emission originates near the auroral regions, and an Io-dependent component is thought to be emitted at the foot points of the Io flux tube. High angular resolution imaging with LOFAR at msec time and kHz frequency resolution would enable mapping both the non-Io and Io related emission components., This paper treats the problem of detecting periodicity in a sequence of photon arrival times, which occurs, for example, in attempting to detect gamma-ray pulsars. A particular focus is on how auxiliary information, typically, source intensity, background intensity, and incident angles and energies associated with each photon arrival, should be used to maximize the detection power. We construct a class of likelihood-based tests, score tests, which give rise to event weighting in a principled and natural way, and derive expressions quantifying the power of the tests. These results can be used to compare the efficacies of different weight functions, including cuts in energy and incident angle. The test is targeted toward a template for the periodic light curve, and we quantify how deviation from that template affects the power of detection., I calculate the action of a satellite, infalling through dynamical friction, on a coplanar gaseous disk of finite radial extent. The disk tides, raised by the infalling satellite, couple the satellite and disk. Dynamical friction acting on the satellite then shrinks the radius of the coupled satellite-disk system. Thus, the gas is ""shepherded"" to smaller radii. In addition, gas shepherding produces a large surface density enhancement at the disk edge. If the disk edge then becomes gravitationally unstable and fragments, it may give rise to enhanced star formation. On the other hand, if the satellite is sufficiently massive and dense, the gas may be transported from ~100 pc to inside of 10 to tens of parsecs before completely fragmenting into stars. I argue that gas shepherding may drive the fueling of active galaxies and central starbursts, and I compare this scenario to competing scenarios. I argue that sufficiently large and dense super star clusters (acting as the shepherding satellites) can shepherd a gas disk down to 10 to tens of parsecs. Inside of 10 to tens of parsecs, another mechanism may operate, i.e., cloud-cloud collisions or a marginally (gravitationally) stable disk, that drives the gas lesssim1 pc, where it can be viscously accreted, feeding a central engine., We study pocket universes which have zero cosmological constant and nontrivial boundary topology. These arise from bubble collisions in eternal inflation. Using a simplified dust model of collisions we find that boundaries of any genus can occur. Using a radiation shell model we perform analytic studies in the thin-wall limit to show the existence of geometries with a single toroidal boundary. We give plausibility arguments that higher genus boundaries can also occur. In geometries with one boundary of any genus a timelike observer can see the entire boundary. Geometries with multiple disconnected boundaries can also occur. In the spherical case with two boundaries the boundaries are separated by a horizon. Our results suggest that the holographic dual description for eternal inflation, proposed by Freivogel, Sekino, Susskind and Yeh, should include summation over the genus of the base space of the dual conformal field theory. We point out peculiarities of this genus expansion compared to the string perturbation series., We examine the upstream meridional deflection flows of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) in an effort to investigate their cross-sectional shape and the magnetic field orientation in their sheath regions. Eight out of 11 magnetic clouds (MCs) near solar minimum identified for the curvature study are concave outward as indicated by the elevation angle of the MC normal with respect to the solar equatorial plane; an inverse correlation is observed between the meridional deflection flow and the spacecraft latitude for these concave-outward MCs, which suggests that the upstream plasma is deflected toward the equatorial plane. MHD simulations, however, show that the meridional deflection flow moves poleward for a concave-outward CME. The poleward flow deflection is observed only ahead of convex-outward MCs. Possibilities leading to this discrepancy are discussed. The deflection flow speed in sheath regions of ICMEs increases with the ICME speed relative to the ambient solar wind, which together with the coupling between the meridional magnetic field and deflection flow yields a positive linear correlation between the sheath meridional field and the ICME relative speed. This empirical relationship could predict the sheath meridional field based on the observed CME speed, which may be useful for space weather forecasting as ICME sheaths are often geoeffective. Implications of the deflection flows and ICME curvature are also discussed in terms of magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in ICME sheaths., We present an analysis of Lunar Prospector Electron Reflectometer data from selected time periods using newly developed methods to correct for spacecraft potential and self-consistently utilizing the entire measured electron distribution to remotely sense the lunar surface electrostatic potential with respect to the ambient plasma. These new techniques enable the first quantitative measurements of lunar surface potentials from orbit. Knowledge of the spacecraft potential also allows accurate characterization of the downward-going electron fluxes that contribute to lunar surface charging, allowing us to determine how the lunar surface potential reacts to changing ambient plasma conditions. On the lunar night side, in shadow, we observe lunar surface potentials of ∼-100 V in the terrestrial magnetotail lobes and potentials of ∼-200 V to ∼-1 kV in the plasma sheet. In the lunar wake, we find potentials of ∼-200 V near the edges but smaller potentials in the central wake, where electron temperatures increase and secondary emission may reduce the magnitude of the negative surface potential. During solar energetic particle events, we see nightside lunar surface potentials as large as ∼-4 kV. On the other hand, on the lunar day side, in sunlight, we generally find potentials smaller than our measurement threshold of ∼20 V, except in the plasma sheet, where we still observe negative potentials of several hundred volts at times, even in sunlight. The presence of significant negative charging in sunlight at these times, given the measured incident electron currents, implies either photocurrents from lunar regolith in situ two orders of magnitude lower than those measured in the laboratory or nonmonotonic near-surface potential variation with altitude. The functional dependence of the lunar surface potential on electron temperature in shadow implies somewhat smaller secondary emission yields from lunar regolith in situ than previously measured in the laboratory. These new techniques open the door for future studies of the variation of lunar surface charging as a function of temporal and spatial variations in input currents and as a function of location and material characteristics of the surface as well as comparisons to the increasingly sophisticated theoretical predictions now available., Most numerical investigations on the role of magnetic fields in turbulent molecular clouds (MCs) are based on ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). However, MCs are weakly ionized, so that the timescale required for the magnetic field to diffuse through the neutral component of the plasma by ambipolar diffusion (AD) can be comparable to the dynamical timescale. We have performed a series of 256<SUP>3</SUP> and 512<SUP>3</SUP> simulations on supersonic but sub-Alfvénic turbulent systems with AD using the heavy-ion approximation developed by Li and coworkers. Our calculations are based on the assumption that the number of ions is conserved, but we show that these results approximately apply to the case of time-dependent ionization in molecular clouds as well. Convergence studies allow us to determine the optimal value of the ionization mass fraction when using the heavy-ion approximation for low Mach number, sub-Alfvénic turbulent systems. We find that ambipolar diffusion steepens the velocity and magnetic power spectra compared to the ideal MHD case. Changes in the density PDF, total magnetic energy, and ionization fraction are determined as a function of the AD Reynolds number. The power spectra for the neutral gas properties of a strongly magnetized medium with a low AD Reynolds number are similar to those for a weakly magnetized medium; in particular, the power spectrum of the neutral velocity is close to that for Burgers turbulence., We present a method to simulate color, 3-dimensional images taken with a space-based observatory by building off of the established shapelets pipeline. The simulated galaxies exhibit complex morphologies, which are realistically correlated between, and include, known redshifts. The simulations are created using galaxies from the 4 optical and near-infrared bands ( B, V, i and z) of the Hubble ultra Deep Field (UDF) as a basis set to model morphologies and redshift. We include observational effects such as sky noise and pixelization and can add astronomical signals of interest such as weak gravitational lensing. The realism of the simulations is demonstrated by comparing their morphologies to the original UDF galaxies and by comparing their distribution of ellipticities as a function of redshift and magnitude to wider HST COSMOS data. These simulations have already been useful for calibrating multicolor image analysis techniques and for better optimizing the design of proposed space telescopes., We present an unbiased census of starless cores in Perseus, Serpens, and Ophiuchus, assembled by comparing large-scale Bolocam 1.1 mm continuum emission maps with Spitzer c2d surveys. We use the c2d catalogs to separate 108 starless from 92 protostellar cores in the 1.1 mm core samples from Enoch and Young and their coworkers. A comparison of these populations reveals the initial conditions of the starless cores. Starless cores in Perseus have similar masses but larger sizes and lower densities on average than protostellar cores, with sizes that suggest density profiles substantially flatter than ρ propto r<SUP>-2</SUP>. By contrast, starless cores in Serpens are compact and have lower masses than protostellar cores; future star formation will likely result in lower mass objects than the currently forming protostars. Comparison to dynamical masses estimated from the NH<SUB>3</SUB> survey of Perseus cores by Rosolowsky and coworkers suggests that most of the starless cores are likely to be gravitationally bound, and thus prestellar. The combined prestellar core mass distribution includes 108 cores and has a slope of α = - 2.3 +/- 0.4 for M &gt; 0.8 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. This slope is consistent with recent measurements of the stellar initial mass function, providing further evidence that stellar masses are directly linked to the core formation process. We place a lower limit on the core-to-star efficiency of 25%. There are approximately equal numbers of prestellar and protostellar cores in each cloud; thus the dense prestellar core lifetime must be similar to the lifetime of embedded protostars, or 4.5 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr, with a total uncertainty of a factor of 2. Such a short lifetime suggests a dynamic, rather than quasi-static, core evolution scenario, at least at the relatively high mean densities (n &gt; 2 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) to which we are sensitive., Galaxy cluster merger statistics are an important component in understanding the formation of large-scale structure. Cluster mergers are also potential sources of systematic error in the mass calibration of upcoming cluster surveys. Unfortunately, it is difficult to study merger properties and evolution directly because the identification of cluster mergers in observations is problematic. We use large N-body simulations to study the statistical properties of massive halo mergers, specifically investigating the utility of close halo pairs as proxies for mergers. We examine the relationship between pairs and mergers for a wide range of merger timescales, halo masses, and redshifts (0 &lt; z &lt; 1). We also quantify the utility of pairs in measuring merger bias. While pairs at very small separations will reliably merge, these constitute a small fraction of the total merger population. Thus, pairs do not provide a reliable direct proxy to the total merger population. We do find an intriguing universality in the relation between close pairs and mergers, which in principle could allow for an estimate of the statistical merger rate from the pair fraction within a scaled separation, but including the effects of redshift space distortions strongly degrades this relation. We find similar behavior for galaxy-mass halos, making our results applicable to field galaxy mergers at high redshift. We investigate how the halo merger rate can be statistically described by the halo mass function via the merger kernel (coagulation), finding an interesting environmental dependence of merging: halos within the mass resolution of our simulations merge less efficiently in overdense environments. Specifically, halo pairs with separations less than a few h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc are more likely to merge in underdense environments; at larger separations, pairs are more likely to merge in overdense environments., Doppler-shift measurements with a remarkable precision of Δλ/λ=3×10<SUP>-9</SUP>, corresponding to velocities of 1 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>, have been made repeatedly of 2500 stars located within 300 light years. The observed gravitational perturbations of the stars have revealed 250 orbiting planets, with 27 that cross in front of the host star, blocking a fraction of the starlight to allow measurement of the planet's mass, radius and density. Two new discoveries are the first good analog of Jupiter (HD 154345b) and the first system of five planets (55 Cancri). The predominantly eccentric orbits of exoplanets probably result from planet planet gravitational interactions or angular momentum exchange by mean-motion resonances. The planet mass distribution ranges from ~15 M<SUB>JUP</SUB> to as low as ~5 M<SUB>Earth</SUB> and rises toward lower masses as dN/dM~M<SUP>-1.1</SUP>. The distribution with orbital distance, a, rises (in logarithmic intervals) as dN/d log a~a<SUP>+0.4</SUP>. Extrapolation and integration suggests that 19% of all Sun-like stars harbor a gas-giant planet within 20 AU, but there remains considerable incompleteness for large orbits. Beyond 20 AU, the occurrence of gas-giant planets may be less than a few per cent as protoplanetary disk material there has lower densities and is vulnerable to destruction. Jupiter-mass planets occur more commonly around more massive stars than low mass stars. The transit of the Neptune-mass planet, Gliese 436b, yields a density of 1.55 g cm<SUP>-3</SUP> suggesting that its interior has an iron silicate core surrounded by an envelope of water ice and an outer H He shell. Planets with masses as low as five Earth-masses may be commonly composed of iron nickel, rock and water along with significant amounts of H and He, making the term 'super-Earth' misleading. The transiting planet HD147506b has high orbital eccentricity but no significant orbital inclination to the line of sight, presenting a puzzle about its history. Its orbit together with the mean motion resonances of 4 of the 22 multi-planet systems provides further evidence for the role of planet planet interactions in shaping planetary architectures., The Cosmic Hot Interstellar Plasma Spectrometer (CHIPS) observatory launched on 12 January 2003, and was the first and only successful GSFC UNEX (NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center University Explorer class) mission. The UNEX program was conceived by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as a new class of Explorer mission charged with demonstrating that significant science and/or technology experiments can be performed by small satellites with constrained budgets and a limited schedule. The purpose of the observatory was to examine details of the local bubble thermal pressure, spatial distribution and ionization history. The observatory was also used to observe solar spectra, both scattered from the Lunar surface and via a fortuitous 2nd order scattering path. CHIPS confirmed that spectral features within the 90-260Å band were much dimmer than was predicted by contemporary theories, and operated four years beyond its design lifetime. The observatory was placed in an extended safe-hold mode in April of 2008 for budgetary purposes. The spectrometer consisted of six spectrograph channels which delivered &gt;λ/100 resolution spectra to a single detector. Cost constraints of UNEX led to a design based on a traditional aluminum structure, and an instrument with a large field of view (5° x 26°). All optical and optomechanical systems on the spectrometer performed flawlessly on orbit. We discuss the challenges, difficulties and lessons learned during the design, fabrication and execution stages of the mission., Every 5.5 years, η Carinae experiences a dramatic ``spectroscopic event'' when high-excitation lines in its UV, optical, and IR spectrum disappear, and its hard X-ray and radio continuum flux crash. This periodicity has been attributed to an eccentric binary system with a shell ejection occurring at periastron, and the next periastron event will occur in January 2009. The last event in June/July 2003 was poorly observed because the star was very low in the sky, but this next event is perfectly suited for an intense ground-based monitoring campaign. Mid-IR images and spectra with T-ReCS provide a direct measure of changes in the current bolometric luminosity and a direct measure of the mass in dust formation episodes that may occur at periastron in the colliding wind shock. Near-IR emission lines trace related changes in the post-event wind and ionization changes in the circumstellar environment needed to test specific models for the cause of η Car's variability as it recovers from its recent ``event''. Because the nebular geometry is known very well from previous observations in this program, monitoring the changes in nebular ionization will yield a 3-D map of the changing asymmetric UV radiation field geometry in the binary system, and the first estimate of the orientation of its orbit., With the current science comissioning of the Allen Telescope Array, we have the first opportunity to conduct a wide-field radio transient survey with real-time transient detection and significant limiting fluxes. The FiGSS survey on the ATA will detect 1-1000 radio transients in semester 2008B. Optical/NIR follow-up of these sources is critical for understanding their nature. Early surveys indicate that many of the transients discovered by FiGSS may be low mass flare stars and supernovae/gamma-ray bursts, but many transients cannot be easily identified with known phenomena. Photometry will show associations with stellar or galactic objects with broad-band SEDs, helping to identify the nature of the objects and calculate rates. The images will also allow us to obtain spectroscopy with other resources to identify the objects and determine the redshifts of the transients. We request follow-up of 12 transients, which will overcome Poisson statistics in rate calculations and is a reasonable estimate of the number of transients to be discovered by the ATA in 2008B. This survey (with optical/NIR follow-up as part of a larger multi-wavelength follow-up program) is a precursor to other transient surveys conducted with future radio arrays such as the MWA, LOFAR, and SKA., POLARBEAR is a ground-based experiment to measure polarization anisotropy in the Cosmic Microwave Background. It is designed to have a combination of sensitivity, foreground mitigation, and rejection of systematic errors to search for the B-mode signature of Inflationary gravity waves over much of the parameter range suggested by simple power-law Inflation models. POLARBEAR is designed to detect a gravitational-wave signature with a tensor-to-scalar ratio r as low as 0.025 (95% confidence). POLARBEAR will also measure polarized lensing of the Cosmic Microwave Background which will give valuable information on large-scale structure at z&gt;1 and bound the total mass of the neutrinos. <P />POLARBEAR will have a 3.5 meter primary meter giving it an angular resolution of 3.0' at its main observation frequency band centered at 150 GHz. The 250 mK focal plane design contains 637 dual-polarization pixels (1274 bolometers) that are coupled to the telescope using microlithographed planar antennas. The experiment will be sited in the Atacama Desert in Chile at 5000 meter (16,500 ft) altitude starting in 2009 after a prototype testing stage at Cedar Flats California. The first configuration of the experiment will observe at only one frequency band with the first season at 150 GHz and the second at 220 GHz. The optics will be upgraded to have simultaneous observations in those two bands in the third season of observations. POLARBEAR and QUIET will observe the same sky patches, and together they will have frequency bands at 30, 40, 90, 150, and 220 GHz giving broad coverage of galactic foregrounds and a valuable cross-check by comparison of polarization maps. In POLARBEAR, polarization systematic errors are mitigated by a continuously rotating 50 K half-wave plate and an observation strategy that takes advantage of parallactic angle rotation to rotate the experiment relative to polarization patterns on the sky., Recent work has shown that the local non-Gaussianity parameter f<SUB>NL</SUB> induces a scale dependent bias, whose amplitude is growing with scale. Here we first rederive this result within the context of the peak-background split formalism and show that it only depends on the assumption of universality of the mass function, assuming that the halo bias only depends on the mass. We then use the extended Press-Schechter formalism to argue that this assumption may be violated and that the scale dependent bias will depend on other properties, such as the merging history of halos. In particular, in the limit of recent mergers we find that the effect is suppressed. Next we use these predictions in conjunction with a compendium of large scale data to put a limit on the value of f<SUB>NL</SUB>. When combining all data assuming that the halo occupation depends only on the halo mass, we get a limit of -29 (-65)&lt;f<SUB>NL</SUB>&lt;+70 (+93) at 95% (99.7%) confidence. While we use a wide range of data sets, our combined result is dominated by the signal from the SDSS photometric quasar sample. If the latter are modeled as recent mergers then the limits weaken to -31 (-96)&lt;f<SUB>NL</SUB>&lt;+70 (+96). These limits are comparable to the strongest current limits from the Wilkinson Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) five-year analysis, with no evidence of a positive signal in f<SUB>NL</SUB>. While the method needs to be thoroughly tested against large scale structure simulations with realistic quasar and galaxy formation models, our results indicate that this is a competitive method relative to the cosmic microwave background one and should be further pursued both observationally and theoretically., Observations of hard X-ray/γ-ray continuum and γ-ray line emission show that electrons are accelerated to &gt;~100 s of MeV and ions up to GeV energies, respectively, in large solar flares. The flare-accelerated electrons above ~20 keV and ions above a few MeV often contain &gt;~10-50% or more of the total energy released, indicating that the particle acceleration is intimately related to the energy release mechanism. RHESSI observations show strong evidence that both the ion and electron acceleration are associated with the process of magnetic reconnection. Direct in situ observations of solar energetic particles (SEPs) near 1 AU indicate that shock waves driven by fast (&gt;~1000 km/s) coronal mass ejections (CMEs) accelerate ions and electrons to similarly high energies, at altitudes of ~2-40 solar radii. Both CMEs and large flares involve the transient release of up to ~10<SUP>32</SUP>-10<SUP>33</SUP> ergs. Frequent acceleration of electrons to ~10 keV is observed in smaller flares and even in microflares. Radio type III bursts indicate that electron acceleration can occur high in the corona, often without flare signatures at lower altitude. At 1 AU, hundreds of small impulsive SEP events are detected per year near solar maximum. These are dominated by &lt;~1 to ~100 keV electrons and often accompanied by tens of keV to MeV/nuc ions, strongly enriched in 3He and heavies,. Here I review the recent RHESSI and related in situ observations as they bear on the fundamental acceleration processes that are occurring., We imaged a 2<SUP>'</SUP> × 2<SUP>'</SUP> region of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) in 1.3 mm wavelength continuum emission with the recently commissioned Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA) and with the Submillimeter Array (SMA). Our mosaics include &gt;250 known near-IR cluster members, of which 36 are so-called ``proplyds'' that have been imaged previously with the Hubble Space Telescope. We detected 40 sources in 1 mm continuum emission (one of which is the BN Object), and several of them are spatially resolved with our observations. The emission from most objects arises predominantly from dust, and circumstellar masses inferred for detected sources range from 0.01 to 0.5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The average circumstellar mass for undetected sources is estimated to be ~0.001 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, approximately an order of magnitude smaller than the minimum-mass solar nebula. Most stars in the ONC thus do not appear to currently possess sufficient mass in small dust grains to form Jupiter-mass (or larger) planets. Comparison with previous results for younger and older regions indicates that massive disks evolve significantly on ~Myr timescales. We also show that the percentage of stars in Orion surrounded by disks more massive than ~0.01 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> is substantially lower than in Taurus, indicating that environment has an impact on the disk-mass distribution. Disks in Orion may be truncated through photoevaporation caused by the intense radiation field of the Trapezium stars, and we see marginal evidence for such a scenario in the spatial distribution of massive disks within the cluster. Our data show no statistically significant correlation between disk and stellar masses, although we see hints of a higher percentage of massive disks around lower mass stars., We present self-consistent models of gas in optically thick dusty disks and calculate its thermal, density, and chemical structure. The models focus on an accurate treatment of the upper layers where line emission originates and at radii gtrsim0.7 AU. Although our models are applicable to stars of any mass, we present here only results around ~1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> stars where we have varied dust properties, X-ray luminosities, and UV luminosities. We separately treat gas and dust thermal balance and calculate line luminosities at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths from all transitions originating in the predominantly neutral gas that lies below the very tenuous and completely ionized surface of the disk. We find that the [Ar II] 7 μm, [Ne II] 12.8 μm, [Fe I] 24 μm, [S I] 25 μm, [Fe II] 26 μm, [Si II] 35 μm, [O I] 63 μm, and pure rotational lines of H<SUB>2</SUB> and CO can be quite strong and are good indicators of the presence and distribution of gas in disks. Water is an important coolant in the disk, and many water emission lines can be moderately strong. Current and future observational facilities such as the Spitzer Space Telescope, Herschel Space Observatory, and SOFIA are capable of detecting gas emission from young disks. We apply our models to the disk around the nearby young star, TW Hya, and find good agreement between our model calculations and observations. We also predict strong emission lines from the TW Hya disk that are likely to be detected by future facilities. We suggest that the gas disk around TW Hya may be truncated to ~120 AU, compared to its dust disk of 174 AU. We speculate that photoevaporation due to the strong stellar FUV field from TW Hya is responsible for the gas disk truncation., In impulsive SEP events, electrons and ions are accelerated at the Sun in a small region, during a short period and then ``injected'' into the solar wind, propagating to 1 AU and are observed by various spacecraft. Their propagation in the solar wind is a competing process between magnetic focusing due to large scale magnetic field geometry and pitch angle scattering due to small scale turbulence in the magnetic field. In a collisionless plasma like the solar wind, the effect of the pitch angle scattering is to alter particle pitch angles in a random but continuous manner during their propagation. Here we briefly discuss a direct Monte-Carlo method that solves the transport equation by following individual particle trajectories. Mathematically, the approach can be understood under the framework of stochastic differential equation method. By casting the underlying Fokker-Planck equation to a set of equations consisting of deterministic pieces and stochastic pieces, one can treat the Lorentz force of the large scale magnetic field and a stochastic force arising from turbulence in the magnetic field separately. Physically, the stochastic pieces describe a diffusion process in particle pitch angle and the rate of particle pitch angle change is readily evaluated through the power of the turbulence., Ion beams streaming upward out of the ionosphere are frequently observed in the auroral acceleration cavity. They mainly consist of H<SUP>+</SUP> and O<SUP>+</SUP> ions drifting along the magnetic field lines and are believed to have been accelerated upward by the same parallel potential drop at the transition from the topside ionosphere. Due to the mass difference, H<SUP>+</SUP> and O<SUP>+</SUP> form two distinct beams drifting at different speeds, whereby two-stream instabilities may develop. Here we present 1D and 2D PIC simulations of the interaction between the H<SUP>+</SUP> and O<SUP>+</SUP> beams in the cavity. Our model describes an open system, where a population of hot plasma sheet protons and hot electrons is at rest while H<SUP>+</SUP> and O<SUP>+</SUP> are constantly injected at the boundary, emulating thus the ion influx from the bottom of the cavity. The study's results indicate two regimes according to the kinetic energy of the injected beams. For moderate energies the unstable waves are of the acoustic type and propagate parallel to the magnetic field. They can trap H<SUP>+</SUP> and O<SUP>+</SUP> ions, leading to phase-space vortices and the accompanying signatures of ion solitary waves in the electric field. For larger energies, the parallel acoustic waves are replaced by oblique cyclotron waves. The latter waves crisscross, forming a herringbone pattern that energizes the O<SUP>+</SUP> ions perpendicularly and leads to drifting conics. By contrast, the protons are hardly energized perpendicularly. The transition between the two regimes depends upon the electron temperature and the ion composition. In either case energy is transferred from the protons to the oxygens., Many biogeochemical and Earth surface processes depend critically on chemical weathering. The immediate products of chemical weathering are present as solutes and secondary minerals in groundwater, soils, and streams, and form the nutritional foundation for terrestrial biogeochemistry. Chemical weathering also contributes to physical erosion by weakening bedrock and producing easily erodible regolith, and as the primary long-term sink for atmospheric CO <SUB>2</SUB> it modulates Earth's long-term climate via the greenhouse effect. Long-term chemical denudation rates on soil-mantled hillslopes can be estimated from cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN) concentrations in soil-borne quartz and the enrichment of a chemically inert tracer in soil relative to its parent bedrock, a technique that inherently assumes steady physical erosion over the timescale of CRN accumulation. We present a numerical model that computes changes in soil mineralogy and CRN concentrations under time-varying physical erosion rates, and we use this model to assess the accuracy of the CRN-based technique for estimating chemical denudation rates in non-steady conditions. Our modeling results suggest that CRN-based estimates of chemical denudation rates closely resemble actual chemical denudation rates averaged over the timescale of CRN accumulation, even during large-amplitude and long-period oscillations in physical erosion rates. For example, this model predicts that when physical erosion rates fluctuate sinusoidally by 50% of their mean over any period in time, CRN-based estimates of chemical denudation rates should differ from actual chemical denudation rates by less than 15%. Our model also implies that chemical denudation rates should approach zero both when physical erosion rates approach zero (because soluble minerals become depleted in the soil) and when physical erosion rates approach the maximum soil production rate (because soil thickness approaches zero). Modeled chemical denudation rates thus reach a maximum at intermediate physical erosion rates. If this relationship holds in nature, it implies that in rapidly eroding regions, further increases in physical erosion rates (e.g., due to increases in tectonic uplift rates) may not necessarily lead to faster chemical denudation on soil-mantled hillslopes., An important problem in space physics still not understood well is how the solar wind enters the Earth's magnetosphere. Evidence is presented that transient solar wind particles produced by solar disturbances can appear in the Earth's mid-altitude (~5 R<SUB>E</SUB> geocentric) cusps with densities nearly equal to those in the magnetosheath. That these are magnetosheath particles is established by showing they have the same ``flattop'' electron distributions as magnetosheath electrons behind the bow shock. The transient ions are moving parallel to the magnetic field (B) toward Earth and often coexist with ionospheric particles that are flowing out. The accompanying waves include electromagnetic and broadband electrostatic noise emissions and Bernstein mode waves. Phase-space distributions show a mixture of hot and cold electrons and multiple ion species including field-aligned ionospheric O<SUP>+</SUP> beams., The solar wind interaction contributes to the loss of Venus atmospheric constituents, especially oxygen, by direct antisunward acceleration of planetary ions and possibly by related sputtering of neutrals. Both comet-like ``ion pickup'' and related sputtering processes may have played a key role in Venus' atmosphere evolution, but the significance of their effects, as well as other proposed escape mechanisms, is still uncertain. In particular, recent reports of only modest ion escape rates measured on Venus Express (VEX) during the current low-activity phase of the solar cycle make it important to reconsider the evidence seen in both Pioneer Venus Orbiter and VEX observations suggesting significantly enhanced escaping O<SUP>+</SUP> ion fluxes during periods of disturbed interplanetary conditions. At present, the most extreme interplanetary conditions result from the effects of coronal mass ejections (CME), which may have been more prevalent in the first 1-2 billion years of the Sun's history. The Analyser of Space Plasmas and Energetic Atoms 4 (ASPERA-4) Ion Mass Analyzer and Magnetometer on Venus Express have now made detailed measurements during several periods when CME disturbances encountered Venus. The observations and models described in this report provide further insights into the possible response of oxygen ion escape to solar activity. In particular, they illustrate nuances of in situ sampling of large-gyroradius pickup ions, related to the atmospheric source properties, spacecraft orbit geometry, and the prevailing interplanetary conditions, that make the estimation of the variable global escape fluxes due to that process particularly challenging. In three of the four cases examined in some detail, ionospheric oxygen ions were either unobservable or below the limit of detectability for passes well within interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) intervals. In the fourth example, where ionospheric ions were observed as expected from the model, O<SUP>+</SUP> pickup ions were observed in greater abundance than is typical in undisturbed solar wind. Other escape processes are not considered here, although it is assumed the source population for the modeled pickup ions is a preaccelerated upper atmosphere component. Analysis of many more ICME events, expected to be obtained as the Sun becomes more active in future years, are necessary to resolve the question of the importance of ICME to Venus oxygen escape., Stars of late-M and L spectral types, collectively known as ultracool dwarfs (UCDs), may be excellent targets for searches for extrasolar planets. Owing to their small radii, the signal from an Earth-size planet transiting a UCD is, in principle, readily detectable. We present results from a study designed to evaluate the feasibility of using precise near-infrared (NIR) photometry to detect terrestrial extrasolar planets orbiting UCDs. We used the Peters Automated Infrared Imaging Telescope (PAIRITEL) to observe a sample of 13 UCDs over a period of 10 months. We consider several important systematic effects in NIR differential photometry and develop techniques for generating photometry with a precision of 0.01 mag and long-term stability. We simulate the planet detection efficiency of an extended campaign to monitor a large sample of UCDs with PAIRITEL. We find that both a targeted campaign with a single telescope lasting several years and a campaign making use of a network of telescopes distributed in longitude could provide significant sensitivity to terrestrial planets orbiting UCDs, potentially in the habitable zone., Aims: To improve our understanding of substellar formation, we have performed a compositional and structural study of a brown dwarf disk. <BR />Methods: We present the results of photometric, spectroscopic, and imaging observations of 2MASS J04442713+2512164, a young brown dwarf (M 7.25) member of the Taurus association. Our dataset, combined with results from the literature, provides a complete coverage of the spectral energy distribution from the optical range to the millimeter, including the first photometric measurement of a brown dwarf disk at 3.7 mm, and allows us to perform a detailed analysis of the disk properties. <BR />Results: The target was known to have a disk. High-resolution optical spectroscopy shows that it is accreting intensely, and powers both a jet and an outflow. The disk structure is similar to what is observed for more massive TTauri stars. Spectral decomposition models of Spitzer/IRS spectra suggest that the mid-infrared emission from the optically thin disk layers is dominated by grains with intermediate sizes (1.5 μm). Crystalline silicates are significantly more abundant in the outer part and/or deeper layers of the disk, implying very efficient mixing and/or additional annealing processes. Submillimeter and millimeter data indicate that most of the disk mass is in large grains (&gt;1 mm)., The concentrations of cosmogenic radionuclides and noble gases in Pitts (IAB) and Horse Creek (ungrouped) provide unambiguous evidence that both irons have a complex exposure history with a first-stage irradiation of 100-600 Myr under high shielding, followed by a second-stage exposure of ∼1 Myr as small objects. The first-stage exposure ages of ∼100 Myr for Horse Creek and ∼600 Myr for Pitts are similar to cosmic-ray exposure ages of other iron meteorites, and most likely represent the Yarkovsky orbital drift times of irons from their parent bodies in the main asteroid belt to one of the nearby chaotic resonance zones. The short second-stage exposure ages indicate that collisional debris from recent impact events on their precursor objects was quickly delivered to Earth. The short delivery times suggests that the recent collision events occurred while the precursor objects of Horse Creek and Pitts were either very close to the chaotic resonance zones or already in Earth-crossing orbits. Since the cosmogenic noble gas records of Horse Creek and Pitts indicate a minimum radius of a few meters for the precursor objects, but do not exclude km-sized objects, we conclude that these irons may represent fragments of two near-Earth asteroids, 3103 Eger and 1986 DA, respectively. Finally, we used the cosmogenic nuclide concentrations in Horse Creek, which contains 2.5 wt% Si, to test current model calculations for the production of cosmogenic <SUP>10</SUP>Be, <SUP>26</SUP>Al, and neonisotopes from iron, nickel, and silicon., Early (&gt;3 Gy) wetter climate conditions on Mars have been proposed, and it is thus likely that pedogenic processes have occurred there at some point in the past. Soil and rock chemistry of the Martian landing sites were evaluated to test the hypothesis that in situ aqueous alteration and downward movement of solutes have been among the processes that have transformed these portions of the Mars regolith. A geochemical mass balance shows that Martian soils at three landing sites have lost significant quantities of major rock-forming elements and have gained elements that are likely present as soluble ions. The loss of elements is interpreted to have occurred during an earlier stage(s) of weathering that may have been accompanied by the downward transport of weathering products, and the salts are interpreted to be emplaced later in a drier Mars history. Chemical differences exist among the sites, indicating regional differences in soil composition. Shallow soil profile excavations at Gusev crater are consistent with late stage downward migration of salts, implying the presence of small amounts of liquid water even in relatively recent Martian history. While the mechanisms for chemical weathering and salt additions on Mars remain unclear, the soil chemistry appears to record a decline in leaching efficiency. A deep sedimentary exposure at Endurance crater contains complex depth profiles of SO <SUB>4</SUB>, Cl, and Br, trends generally consistent with downward aqueous transport accompanied by drying. While no model for the origin of Martian soils can be fully constrained with the currently available data, a pedogenic origin is consistent with observed Martian geology and geochemistry, and provides a testable hypothesis that can be evaluated with present and future data from the Mars surface., In any theory it is unnatural if the observed values of parameters lie very close to special values that determine the existence of complex structures necessary for observers. A naturalness probability P is introduced to numerically evaluate the degree of unnaturalness. If P is very small in all known theories, corresponding to a high degree of fine-tuning, then there is an observer naturalness problem. In addition to the well-known case of the cosmological constant, we argue that nuclear stability and electroweak symmetry breaking represent significant observer naturalness problems. The naturalness probability associated with nuclear stability depends on the theory of flavor, but for all known theories is conservatively estimated as P<SUB>nuc</SUB>≲(10<SUP>-3</SUP> 10<SUP>-2</SUP>), and for simple theories of electroweak symmetry breaking P<SUB>EWSB</SUB>≲(10<SUP>-2</SUP> 10<SUP>-1</SUP>). This pattern of unnaturalness in three different arenas, cosmology, nuclear physics, and electroweak symmetry breaking, provides evidence for the multiverse, since each problem may be easily solved by environmental selection. In the nuclear case the problem is largely solved even if the multiverse distribution for the relevant parameters is relatively flat. With somewhat strongly varying distributions, it is possible to understand both the close proximity to neutron stability and the values of m<SUB>e</SUB> and m<SUB>d</SUB>-m<SUB>u</SUB> in terms of the electromagnetic mass difference between the proton and neutron, δ<SUB>EM</SUB>≃1±0.5MeV. It is reasonable that multiverse distributions are strong functions of Lagrangian parameters, since they depend not only on the landscape of vacua, but also on the population mechanism, “integrating out” other parameters, and on a density of observers factor. In any theory with mass scale M that is the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking, strongly varying multiverse distributions typically lead either to a little hierarchy v/M≈(10<SUP>-2</SUP> 10<SUP>-1</SUP>), or to a large hierarchy v≪M. In certain multiverses, where electroweak symmetry breaking occurs only if M is below some critical value, we find that a little hierarchy develops with the value of v<SUP>2</SUP>/M<SUP>2</SUP> suppressed by an extra loop factor, as well as by the strength of the distribution. Since the correct theory of electroweak symmetry breaking is unknown, our estimate for P<SUB>EWSB</SUB> is theoretical. The LHC will lead to a much more robust determination of P<SUB>EWSB</SUB>, and, depending on which theory is indicated by the data, the observer naturalness problem of electroweak symmetry breaking may be removed or strengthened. For each of the three arenas, the discovery of a natural theory would eliminate the evidence for the multiverse; but in the absence of such a theory, the multiverse provides a provisional understanding of the data., Simulation has become a valuable tool that compliments more traditional methods used to understand solar system plasmas and their interactions with planets, moons and comets. The three popular simulation approaches to studying these interactions are presented. Each approach provides valuable insight to these interactions. To date no one approach is capable of simulating the whole interaction region from the collisionless to the collisional regimes. All three approaches are therefore needed. Each approach has several implicit physical assumptions as well as several numerical assumptions depending on the scheme used. The magnetohydrodynamic (MHD), test-particle/Monte-Carlo and hybrid models used in simulating flowing plasmas are described. Special consideration is given to the implicit assumptions underlying each model. Some of the more common numerical methods used to implement each model, the implications of these numerical methods and the resulting limitations of each simulation approach are also discussed., We present the extension of the magnetic breakout model for CME initiation to a fully three-dimensional, spherical geometry. Given the increased complexity of the dynamic magnetic field interactions in three dimensions, we first present a summary of the well known axisymmetric breakout scenario in terms of the topological evolution associated with the various phases of the eruptive process. In this context, we discuss the analogous topological evolution during the magnetic breakout CME initiation process in the simplest three-dimensional multipolar system. We show that an extended bipolar active region embedded in an oppositely directed background dipole field has all the necessary topological features required for magnetic breakout, i.e., a fan separatrix surface between the two distinct flux systems, a pair of spine field lines, and a true three-dimensional coronal null point at their intersection. We then present the results of a numerical MHD simulation of this three-dimensional system where boundary shearing flows introduce free magnetic energy, eventually leading to a fast magnetic breakout CME. The eruptive flare reconnection facilitates the rapid conversion of this stored free magnetic energy into kinetic energy and the associated acceleration causes the erupting field and plasma structure to reach an asymptotic eruption velocity of gtrsim1100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> over an ~15 minute time period. The simulation results are discussed using the topological insight developed to interpret the various phases of the eruption and the complex, dynamic, and interacting magnetic field structures., We present results of a study of charged particle track and vertex reconstruction with a beam telescope made of four layers of 50μm-thin CMOS monolithic pixel sensors using the 120 GeV protons at the FNAL Meson Test Beam Facility. We compare our results to the performance requirements of a future e<SUP></SUP>e<SUP></SUP> linear collider in terms of particle track extrapolation and vertex reconstruction accuracies., In this study, we investigate the formation and properties of prestellar and protostellar cores using hydrodynamic self-gravitating adaptive mesh refinement simulations, comparing the cases where turbulence is continually driven and where it is allowed to decay. We model observations of these cores in the C<SUP>18</SUP>O(2 → 1), NH<SUB>3</SUB>(1, 1), and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1 → 0) lines, and from the simulated observations we measure the line widths of individual cores, the line widths of the surrounding gas, and the motions of the cores relative to one another. Some of these distributions are significantly different in the driven and decaying runs, making them potential diagnostics for determining whether the turbulence in observed star-forming clouds is driven or decaying. Comparing our simulations with observed cores in the Perseus and ρ Ophiuchus clouds shows reasonably good agreement between the observed and simulated core-to-core velocity dispersions for both the driven and decaying cases. However, we find that the line widths through protostellar cores in both simulations are too large compared to the observations. The disagreement is noticeably worse for the decaying simulation, in which cores show highly supersonic infall signatures in their centers that decrease toward their edges, a pattern not seen in the observed regions. This result gives some support to the use of driven turbulence for modeling regions of star formation, but reaching a firm conclusion on the relative merits of driven or decaying turbulence will require more complete data on a larger sample of clouds as well as simulations that include magnetic fields, outflows, and thermal feedback from the protostars., We present the first results from the successful fabrication of an optical imaging tube consisting of a pair of MCPs read out by a CMOS application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) developed for x-ray imaging called the Medipix2. The Medipix2 is an array of 256×256 pixels, each of which amplifies and counts individual photon stimulated events amplified by the MCPs. A multi-alkali photocathode installed in proximity focus above the MCP is used for conversion of incoming photons into photoelectrons.. The Medipix2 integrates these detected photons, and the binary values of these counters is read fast (~ 1kHz frame rate) and without readout noise. Initial imaging tests of this tube, including QE, resolution, background, dynamic range and microsecond shutter operation are presented.., The ISI (Infrared Spatial Interferometer) involves three movable telescopes of Pfund design, each in trailers, each with a radiation collecting mirror 65 inches in diameter. The telescopes can be moved, and then set down on concrete pads for stability. They are located on Mt. Wilson, where pads have been arranged to give baselines varying from 4 to approximately 75 meters and oriented in various directions. Initial work, between 1988 and 2002, was done with two telescopes; the third telescope was added in 2003., The TEDI (TripleSpec - Exoplanet Discovery Instrument) is the first instrument dedicated to the near infrared radial velocity search for planetary companions to low-mass stars. The TEDI uses Externally Dispersed Interferometry (EDI), a combination of interferometry and multichannel dispersive spectroscopy. We have joined a white-light interferometer with the Cornell TripleSpec (0.9 - 2.4 μm) spectrograph at the Palomar Observatory 200"" telescope and begun an experimental program to establish both the experimental and analytical techniques required for precision IR velocimetry and the Doppler-search for planets orbiting low mass stars and brown dwarfs., The solar wind blows an immense magnetic bubble, the heliosphere, in the local interstellar medium (mostly neutral gas) flowing by the Sun. Recent measurements by Voyager 2 across the termination shock, where the solar wind is slowed to subsonic speeds before entering the heliosheath, found that the shocked solar wind plasma contains only ~20 per cent of the energy released by the termination shock, whereas energetic particles above ~28keV contain only ~10 per cent; ~70 per cent of the energy is unaccounted for, leading to speculation that the unmeasured pickup ions or energetic particles below 28keV contain the missing energy. Here we report the detection and mapping of heliosheath energetic (~4-20keV) neutral atoms produced by charge exchange of suprathermal ions with interstellar neutral atoms. The energetic neutral atoms come from a source ~60° wide in longitude straddling the direction of the local interstellar medium. Their energy spectra resemble those of solar wind pickup ions, but with a knee at ~11keV instead of ~4keV, indicating that their parent ions are pickup ions energized by the termination shock. These termination-shock-energized pickup ions contain the missing ~70 per cent of the energy dissipated in the termination shock, and they dominate the pressure in the heliosheath., We are developing antenna-coupled Transition Edge Sensor (TES) bolometers to be used in the focal planes of telescopes mapping Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization anisotropies. These detectors will be both dual-polarized and ultra-wide band, each containing several frequency channels. Arrays of such detectors could realize mapping speeds nearly an order of magnitude higher than previously deployed technology while naturally facilitating foreground removal. For such detectors to be useful, the antennas must have a high gain and a low cross-polarization. We have designed a novel modification of DuHamel's Sinuous antenna that couples to a contacting lens and is driven by integrated microstrip feed-lines. The integrated feed lines allow the antenna to interface with microstrip circuits and bolometers in a way that is planar and scalable to kilo-pixel arrays. We have demonstrated the polarization and beam properties with scale model antennas that operate at 1-12 GHz., Evidence is presented that the dominant non-trend mode of interdecadal global SST variations is linked to significant modulation of ENSO variance during the past 150 years. The mode resembles the interhemispheric SST pattern linked to Sahel rainfall changes, with colder northern hemisphere conditions co-incident with higher ENSO variance. Simulations of an intermediate coupled global climate model demonstrate that this global SST pattern can drive the interdecadal changes to ENSO variance. The influence on the ENSO dynamics comes primarily from the portion of the SST change local to the tropical Pacific, which is warm over the entire equatorial Pacific particularly in the southeast during times of stronger ENSO activity. We speculate that the warming equatorial SST causes ENSO events occur earlier and thus have longer time to develop, as well as enhancing the vertical temperature gradient and thus increasing the effectiveness of oceanic entrainment., The solar eruption on 2007 May 19, from AR 10956 near solar disk center, consisted of a B9.5 flare (12:48 UT), a filament eruption, an EUV dimming, a coronal wave, and a multifront CME. The eruption was observed by the twin STEREO spacecraft at a separation angle of 8.5°. We report analysis of the source region photospheric magnetic field and its preeruption evolution using MDI magnetograms, the coronal magnetic field topology estimated via PFSS modeling, and the coronal dynamics of the eruption through STEREO EUVI wavelet-enhanced anaglyph movies. Despite its moderate magnitude and size, AR 10956 was a complex and highly nonpotential active region with a multipolar configuration, and hosted frequent flares, multiple filament eruptions, and CMEs. In the 2 days prior to the May 19 eruption, the total unsigned magnetic flux of the region decreased by ~17%. We interpret the photospheric magnetic field evolution, the coronal field topology, and the observed coronal dynamics in the context of current models of CME initiation and discuss the prospects for future MHD modeling inspired by these analyses., We explore the impact of interhemispheric thermal gradients forcing on the tropical Pacific ocean-atmosphere climate in an intermediate coupled model. The equatorial zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient strengthens with an increased northward interhemispheric thermal gradient, the increase arising from earlier onset and later retreat of the seasonal cold tongue, and intensification during the peak cold season. When the mean interhemispheric thermal gradient is reversed, the central equatorial Pacific SST annual cycle abruptly reverses in phase, with its cold season in Mar-May rather than Sep-Nov. While startling, this response is consistent with a prevailing hypothesis that ties the cold tongue SST annual cycle phase to the hemispheric mean asymmetry of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. El Niño-Southern Oscillation activity is also sensitive to the interhemispheric thermal gradient, with peak activity occurring when the mean gradient is small, reducing rapidly as the mean gradient increases in either direction., Recent progress in Gallium Nitride (GaN, AlGaN, InGaN) photocathodes show great promise for future detector applications in Astrophysical instruments. Efforts with opaque GaN photocathodes have yielded quantum efficiencies up to 70% at 120 nm and cutoffs at ~380 nm, with low out of band response, and high stability. Previous work with semitransparent GaN photocathodes produced relatively low quantum efficiencies in transmission mode (4%). We now have preliminary data showing that quantum efficiency improvements of a factor of 5 can be achieved. We have also performed two dimensional photon counting imaging with 25mm diameter semitransparent GaN photocathodes in close proximity to a microchannel plate stack and a cross delay line readout. The imaging performance achieves spatial resolution of ~50μm with low intrinsic background (below 1 event sec<SUP>-1</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) and reasonable image uniformity. GaN photocathodes with significant quantum efficiency have been fabricated on ceramic MCP substrates. In addition GaN has been deposited at low temperature onto quartz substrates, also achieving substantial quantum efficiency., The Medium-Energy Gamma-ray Astronomy library MEGAlib is an open-source object-oriented software library designed to simulate and analyze data of low-to-medium-energy gamma-ray telescopes, especially Compton telescopes. The library comprises all necessary simulation and data analysis tools including geometry construction, Monte-Carlo simulation, response creation, event reconstruction, image reconstruction, and other high-level data-analysis tools., We report on a purely coronal hard X-ray source detected in a partially disk-occulted solar flare by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) that is associated with radio type III bursts and a suprathermal electron event detected near 1 AU by the WIND 3-D Plasma and Energetic Particle (3DP) instrument. Several observational characteristics suggest that the coronal hard X-ray source is thin target bremsstrahlung emission from the escaping electrons that produce the radio type III bursts. The hard X-ray emission correlates in time with the radio type III bursts and originates from a radially elongated source in the corona with a length (~65 Mm) similar to typical coronal density scale heights. Furthermore, the difference between the hard X-ray photon spectral index (γ = 4.1 +/- 0.4) and the electron spectral index of the in situ observed event (δ<SUB>in situ</SUB> = 2.9 +/- 0.3) is around 1, consistent with the thin target interpretation. A further test for the thin target scenario is to compare the number of electrons needed to produce the observed hard X-ray emission with the number of in situ observed electrons. However, the number of escaping electrons derived from the single-spacecraft WIND measurement is in the best case an order of magnitude estimate and could easily underestimate the actual number of escaping electrons. Using the WIND observations, the estimated number of escaping electrons is about an order of magnitude too low. Thus, the thin target interpretation only holds if the WIND measurements are significantly underestimating the actual number of escaping electrons. Future multispacecraft observations with STEREO, Solar Orbiter, and Sentinels will resolve this uncertainty., By numerically integrating the orbits of the giant planets and of test particles over a period of four billion years, we follow the evolution of the location of the midplane of the Kuiper belt. The Classical Kuiper belt conforms to a warped sheet that precesses with a 1.9 Myr period. The present-day location of the Kuiper belt plane can be computed using linear secular perturbation theory: the local normal to the plane is given by the theory's forced inclination vector, which is specific to every semimajor axis. The Kuiper belt plane does not coincide with the invariable plane, but deviates from it by up to a few degrees in stable zones. For example, at a semimajor axis of 38 AU, the local Kuiper belt plane has an inclination of 1.9 degrees and a longitude of ascending node of 149.9 degrees when referred to the mean ecliptic and equinox of J2000. At a semimajor axis of 43 AU, the local plane has an inclination of 1.9 degrees and a nodal longitude of 78.3 degrees. Only at infinite semimajor axis does the Kuiper belt plane merge with the invariable plane, whose inclination is 1.6 degrees and nodal longitude is 107.7 degrees. A Classical Kuiper belt object keeps its inclination relative to the Kuiper belt plane nearly constant, even while the plane departs from the trajectory predicted by linear theory. The constancy of relative inclination reflects the undamped amplitude of free oscillation; that is, the homogeneous solution to the forced harmonic oscillator equation retains constant amplitude, even while the inhomogeneous solution cannot be written down accurately because the planetary forcing terms are chaotic. Current observations of Classical Kuiper belt objects are consistent with the plane being warped by the giant planets alone, but the sample size will need to increase by a few times before confirmation exceeds 3σ in confidence. In principle, differences between the theoretically expected plane and the observed plane could be used to infer as yet unseen masses orbiting the Sun, but carrying out such a program would be challenging., In 2003, we initiated a long-term Adaptive Optics campaign to study the orbit of various main-belt asteroidal systems. Here we present a consistent solution for the mutual orbits of four binary systems: 22 Kalliope, 45 Eugenia, 107 Camilla and 762 Pulcova. With the exception of 45 Eugenia, we did not detect any additional satellites around these systems although we have the capability of detecting a loosely-bound fragment (located at 1/4×R) that is ∼40 times smaller in diameter than the primary. The common characteristic of these mutual orbits is that they are roughly circular. Three of these binary systems belong to a C-""group"" taxonomic class. Our estimates of their bulk densities are consistently lower (∼1 g/cm <SUP>3</SUP>) than their associated meteorite analogs, suggesting an interior porosity of 30-50% (taking CI-CO meteorites as analogs). 22 Kalliope, a W-type asteroid, has a significantly higher bulk density of ∼3 g/cm <SUP>3</SUP>, derived based on IRAS radiometric size measurement. We compare the characteristics of these orbits in the light of tidal-effect evolution., The physics behind the acceleration of the cosmic expansion can be elucidated through comparison of the predictions of dark energy equations of state to observational data. In seeking to optimize this, we investigate the advantages and disadvantages of using principal component analysis, uncorrelated bandpowers and the equation of state within redshift bins. We demonstrate that no one technique is a panacea, with tension between clear physical interpretation from localization and from decorrelated errors, as well as model dependence and form dependence. Specific lessons include the critical role of proper treatment of the high redshift expansion history and the lack of a unique, well-defined signal to noise or figure of merit., Using RHESSI data, we have analyzed 172 hard X-ray (HXR) peaks during 53 solar flares that exhibited a double-footpoint structure. Fitting both footpoints with power laws, we find that spectral index differences Δγ range mostly between 0 to 0.6, and only rarely go beyond. Asymmetries between footpoints were not observed to be significantly dependent on their mean heliographic position, their relative position with respect to each other, nor their orientation with respect to the solar equator. By assuming a symmetric acceleration process, it is also clear that differences in footpoint spectral indices and footpoint flux ratios can seldom be attributed to a difference in column densities between the two legs of a coronal loop. Our results corroborate better the magnetic mirror trap scenario. Moreover, footpoint asymmetries are more marked during times of peak HXR flux than when averaging over the whole HXR burst, suggesting that the magnetic configuration evolves during individual HXR bursts. We also observed a linear correlation between the peak 50-keV flux and the peak GOES 1 - 8 Å channel flux and that HXR burst duration seem correlated with loop length., This paper reports the results of a study of the supersymmetric neutral heavy Higgs boson production process e<SUP>+</SUP>e<SUP>-</SUP>→H<SUP>0</SUP>A<SUP>0</SUP> at s=1TeV performed using fully simulated and reconstructed events. The adopted parameters for the supersymmetric models are compatible with the relic dark matter density if this is due to neutralinos annihilating through the A<SUP>0</SUP> boson in the early universe. The accuracies on the heavy Higgs boson masses, widths, and decay branching fractions are estimated to be δM<SUB>A<SUP>0</SUP></SUB>/M<SUB>A<SUP>0</SUP></SUB>=0.0024 δΓ<SUB>A<SUP>0</SUP></SUB>/Γ<SUB>A<SUP>0</SUP></SUB>=0.19, δBR(A<SUP>0</SUP>→b bmacr )/BR(A<SUP>0</SUP>→b bmacr )=0.07, and δBR(A<SUP>0</SUP>→τ<SUP>+</SUP>τ<SUP>-</SUP>)/BR(A<SUP>0</SUP>→τ<SUP>+</SUP>τ<SUP>-</SUP>)=0.15 These results, combined with other measurements from the LHC and an e<SUP>+</SUP>e<SUP>-</SUP> collider, allow the supersymmetric dark matter density to be inferred to a relative accuracy δΩ<SUB>χ</SUB>h<SUP>2</SUP>/Ω<SUB>χ</SUB>h<SUP>2</SUP>=0.08., We consider the radiative feedback processes that operate during the formation of the first stars. (1) Photodissociation of H<SUB>2</SUB> in the local dark matter minihalo occurs early in the growth of the protostar but does not affect subsequent accretion. (2) Lyα radiation pressure acting at the boundary of the H II region that the protostar creates in the accreting envelope reverses infall in the polar directions when the star reaches ~20-30 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> but cannot prevent infall from other directions. (3) Expansion of the H II region beyond the gravitational escape radius for ionized gas occurs at masses ~50-100 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. However, accretion from the equatorial regions can continue since the neutral accretion disk shields a substantial fraction of the accretion envelope from direct ionizing flux. (4) At higher stellar masses, ~140 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> in the fiducial case, photoevaporation-driven mass loss from the disk, together with declining accretion rates, halts the increase in the protostellar mass. We identify this process as the mechanism that determines the mass of Population III.1 stars (i.e., stars with primordial composition that have not been affected by prior star formation). The initial mass function of these stars is set by the distribution of entropy and angular momentum. The Appendix gives approximate solutions to a number of problems relevant to the formation of the first stars: the effect of Rayleigh scattering on line profiles in media of very large optical depth, the intensity of Lyα radiation in very opaque media, radiative acceleration in terms of the gradient of a modified radiation pressure, the flux of radiation in a shell with an arbitrary distribution of opacity, and the vertical structure of an accretion disk supported by gas pressure with constant opacity., We investigate practical implementations of the Korsch<SUP>1</SUP> (1977) annular field three mirror anastigmat (AFTMA) telescope. This TMA offers a wide, diffraction-limited field of view (FOV) suitable for space-based survey missions. The advantages of this configuration include superior stray light baffling (distinct exit pupil) and the wide range of available focal lengths available from geometrically similar configurations. Key in the design of an AFTMA is the location of the Cassegrain focus (CF) and the exit pupil (EP). We investigate the effects of telescope geometry and optimization constraints on the location of the CF and EP, and suggest a family of geometries suitable for practical and vignetting-free AFTMA designs. The space of practical designs is generalized in terms of mirror diameter, telescope focal ratio and field of view for an annular, detector-tiled focal plane. Focal ratios between roughly f/10 and f/25 produce a geometric blur of less than 0.1arcsec. For this range of f/numbers, the focal plane should be less than Â½ the primary mirror (PM) diameter, and the cross-axis should be located roughly 0.6 PM diameters behind the PM vertex., We present a simple set of kinematic criteria that can distinguish between galaxies dominated by ordered rotational motion and those involved in major merger events. Our criteria are based on the dynamics of the warm ionized gas (as traced by Hα) within galaxies, making this analysis accessible to high-redshift systems, whose kinematics are primarily traceable through emission features. Using the method of kinemetry (developed by Krajnović and coworkers), we quantify asymmetries in both the velocity and velocity dispersion maps of the warm gas, and the resulting criteria enable us to empirically differentiate between nonmerging and merging systems at high redshift. We apply these criteria to 11 of our best-studied rest-frame UV/optical-selected z ~ 2 galaxies for which we have near-infrared integral-field spectroscopic data from SINFONI on the VLT. Of these 11 systems, we find that &gt;50% have kinematics consistent with a single rotating disk interpretation, while the remaining systems are more likely undergoing major mergers. This result, combined with the short formation timescales of these systems, provides evidence that rapid, smooth accretion of gas plays a significant role in galaxy formation at high redshift. <P />Based on observations obtained at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) of the European Southern Observatory, Paranal, Chile in the context of guaranteed time programs 073.B-9018, 074.A-9011, 075.A-0466, 076.A-0527, 077.A-0576, 078.A-0600, and 079.A-0341., The magnetic signatures and crater retention ages of the 19 largest (&gt;1000 km diameter) impact basins on Mars are examined to constrain the history of the acquisition of crustal magnetization during the Noachian era. The 5 most clearly impact-demagnetized basins are younger than the 14 basins within which lies substantially re-magnetized crust. Poisson analysis shows that the most likely time of this magnetization cessation was 4.115-4.13 Ga (model age) and that it occurred quickly, taking less than 20 Ma. A global decrease in effective crustal magnetic susceptibility due, e.g., to a decrease in the rate of hydrothermal alteration, is one possible explanation. Alternatively, the cessation of post-impact magnetization reflects the rapid death of the Martian dynamo., Bicep is a ground-based millimeter-wave bolometric array designed to target the primordial gravity wave signature on the B-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at degree angular scales. Currently in its third year of operation at the South Pole, Bicep is measuring the CMB polarization with unprecedented sensitivity at 100 and 150 GHz in the cleanest available 2% of the sky, as well as deriving independent constraints on the diffuse polarized foregrounds with select observations on and off the Galactic plane. Instrument calibrations are discussed in the context of rigorous control of systematic errors, and the performance during the first two years of the experiment is reviewed., In 2001, a small H4 chondrite, Frontier Mountain (FRO) 01149, was found on a glacially eroded surface near the top of Frontier Mountain, Antarctica, about 600 m above the present ice level. The metal and sulphides are almost completely oxidized due to terrestrial weathering. We used a chemical leaching procedure to remove weathering products, which contained atmospheric <SUP>10</SUP>Be and <SUP>36</SUP>Cl in a ratio similar to that found in Antarctic ice. The FRO 01149 meteorite has a terrestrial age of 3.0 ± 0.3 Myr based on the concentrations of the cosmogenic radionuclides <SUP>10</SUP>Be, <SUP>26</SUP>Al and <SUP>36</SUP>Cl. This age implies that FRO 01149 is the oldest stony meteorite (fossil meteorites excluded) discovered on Earth. The noble gas cosmic ray exposure age of FRO 01149 is ~ 30 Myr. The meteorite thus belongs to the 33 Myr exposure age peak of H-chondrites. The bedrock surface on which FRO 01149 was found has wet-based glacial erosional features recording a former high-stand of the East Antarctic ice sheet. This ice sheet evidently overrode the highest peaks (&gt; 2800 m a.s.l.) of the inland sector of the Transantarctic Mountains in northern Victoria Land. We argue that FRO 01149 was a local fall and that its survival on a glacially eroded bedrock surface constrains the age of the last overriding event to be older than ~ 3 Myr. The concentrations of in-situ produced cosmogenic <SUP>10</SUP>Be, <SUP>26</SUP>Al and <SUP>21</SUP>Ne in a glacially eroded bedrock sample taken from near the summit of Frontier Mountain yield a surface exposure age of 4.4 Myr and indicate that the bedrock was covered by several meters of snow. The exposure age is also consistent with bedrock exposure ages of other summit plateaus in northern Victoria Land., Using a new empirical relation among earthquake magnitude, seismic energy density and hypocentral distance, we show that the documented water level changes during earthquakes occur across seven orders of magnitude of seismic energy density. Combining this relation with a global data set for water level changes, new data from Taiwan, and laboratory data for saturated sediments under cyclic loading, we show that at least two mechanisms may be important for inducing water level changes. Undrained volumetric change may be the dominant mechanism to cause the abrupt decrease or increase of water level documented in the near field, while an earthquake-enhanced permeability may account for the more gradual and sustained water level changes documented in the intermediate field., The presence of dark energy at high redshift influences both the cosmic sound horizon and the distance to last scattering of the cosmic microwave background. We demonstrate that, through the degeneracy in their ratio, early dark energy can lie hidden in the CMB temperature and polarization spectra, leading to an unrecognized shift in the sound horizon. If the sound horizon is then used as a standard ruler, as in baryon acoustic oscillations, then the derived cosmological parameters can be nontrivially biased. Fitting for the absolute ruler scale (just as supernovae must be fitted for the absolute candle magnitude) removes the bias but decreases the leverage of the BAO technique by a factor of two., Void regions of the Universe offer a special environment for studying cosmology and galaxy formation, which may expose weaknesses in our understanding of these phenomena. Although galaxies in voids are observed to be predominately gas rich, star forming and blue, a subpopulation of bright-red void galaxies can also be found, whose star formation was shutdown long ago. Are the same processes that quench star formation in denser regions of the Universe also at work in voids? <P />We compare the luminosity function of void galaxies in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey, to those from a galaxy formation model built on the Millennium simulation. We show that a global star formation suppression mechanism in the form of low-luminosity `radio-mode' active galactic nuclei (AGN) heating is sufficient to reproduce the observed population of void early types. Radio-mode heating is environment independent other than its dependence on dark matter halo mass, where, above a critical mass threshold of approximately M<SUB>vir</SUB> ~ 10<SUP>12.5</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB>, gas cooling on to the galaxy is suppressed and star formation subsequently fades. In the Millennium simulation, the void halo mass function is shifted with respect to denser environments, but still maintains a high-mass tail above this critical threshold. In such void haloes, radio-mode heating remains efficient and red galaxies are found; collectively these galaxies match the observed space density without any modification to the model. Consequently, galaxies living in vastly different large-scale environments but hosted by haloes of similar mass are predicted to have similar properties, consistent with observations., During a period of 12 minutes on 2002 July 19 14:23-14:35 UT, the WAVES instrument on WIND observed six interplanetary type III radio bursts, one approximately every 2 minutes, and each was accompanied by a weak hard X-ray (HXR) burst (12-15 keV) observed by RHESSI. The radio bursts are observed up to 150 MHz with some up to 600 MHz. Simultaneous observations by TRACE show jetlike eruptions emanating from the region of HXR emission. The observed HXRs are inconsistent with emission from the escaping type III-producing nonthermal electrons. We suggest that the type III acceleration process may be associated with an explosive release of lsim5 × 10<SUP>26</SUP> ergs in the form of a ""superhot"" (26 MK) thermal plasma in the corona, an energy comparable to that associated with the type III-producing electrons., Analyses of satellite-measured fields and flows through reconnecting current sheets have assumed that the relative velocity of the satellite and the current sheet is in the direction of the current sheet normal. During analyses, this relative normal velocity has been removed by translation of the satellite data. The assumption that the relative motion is along the normal may be invalid such that, in the satellite reference frame, the reconnection structure moves in the plane of the current sheet during the crossing. In this case, the fields and flows are not measured in the reconnection rest frame although they must be known in this frame for quantitative analyses of the reconnection data. Consequences of this slippage of the reconnection rest frame in the plane of the current sheet are investigated to show that errors may be large and that rotation (minimum variance, maximum variance, or Faraday Residue) or translation (to the normal incidence frame, the deHoffman-Teller frame, etc.) can exacerbate them. It is often the case that little can be done to guarantee a meaningful event analysis because of the insufficiency of the data collected in single satellite crossings of a reconnecting current sheet., We present equivalent width maps of the 1.98 and 2.13 μm SO <SUB>2</SUB> ice absorption bands on the surface of Io. The data were taken on 17 April 2006 with the near-infrared mapping spectrometer, OSIRIS at the W.M. Keck Observatory, Hawaii. The maps show significant regional enhancements of SO <SUB>2</SUB> ice over the Bosphoros, Media, Tarsus and Chalybes Regiones., An asymptotic technique, valid in the presence of smoothly varying flow properties, allows for the construction of a semi-analytic solution to the governing equations of quasi-static poroelasticity. In this formulation flow properties are variable while mechanical properties are constant within a specified formation. However, both mechanical and flow properties are allowed to vary discontinuously across formation boundaries. The asymptotic analysis determines that two longitudinal modes of propagation are possible: the Biot fast and slow waves. The Biot slow wave propagates as a diffusive disturbance, similar in nature to a pressure disturbance. The Biot fast wave has the characteristics of an elastic wave, and decays much more slowly with distance than does the slow wave. The Biot slow wave is found to generate elastic displacements, in the form of fast waves, as it propagates. This generation of fast waves explains the rapid onset of displacement at a remote observation point due to the injection of fluid into a poroelastic layer. A comparison of the asymptotic solution with analytic and numerical (finite-difference) solutions indicates overall agreement in both homogeneous and heterogeneous media., New observations by the THEMIS spacecraft have revealed dense (&gt;10 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) plasmaspheric plumes extending to the magnetopause. The large scale radial structure of these plumes is revealed by multi-spacecraft measurements. Temporal variations in the radial distribution of plume plasma, caused by azimuthal density gradients coupled with azimuthal flow, are also shown to contribute to plume structure. In addition, flux tubes with cold plume plasma are shown to participate in reconnection, with simultaneous observations of cold ions and reconnection flow jets on open flux tubes as revealed by the loss of hot magnetospheric electrons., We measure the Galactic rotation curve and its first two vertical derivatives in the first and fourth quadrants of the Milky Way using the 21 cm VGPS and SGPS. We find tangent velocities of the atomic gas as a function of Galactic longitude and latitude by fitting an analytic line profile to the edges of the velocity profiles. The shape of the analytic profile depends only on the tangent velocity and the velocity dispersion of the gas. We use two complementary methods to analyze the tangent velocities: a global model to fit typical parameter values and a local fitting routine to examine spatial variations. We confirm the validity of our fitting routines by testing simple models. Both the global and local fits are consistent with a vertical falloff in the rotation curve of -22 +/- 6 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> kpc<SUP>-1</SUP> within 100 pc of the Galactic midplane. The magnitude of the falloff is several times larger than what would be expected from the change in the potential alone, indicating some other physical process is important. The falloff we measure is consistent in magnitude with that measured in the halo gas of other galaxies., In this case study we report a substorm, 23 March 2007, which exhibited oscillations with a period of ~135 s in three substorm phenomena all of which were one-to-one correlated. The in-situ observations are from one THEMIS spacecraft (8.3 R <SUB> E </SUB> geocentric distance) and the geosynchronous LANL-97A spacecraft. The focus here is on the intensification phase during which THEMIS was conjugate to the region of auroral brightening and its foot point was near the high-latitude ground station Kiana. The following results will be demonstrated: (1) THEMIS and LANL-97A (time-delayed) recorded periodic ion injections (&gt;100 keV). (2) Near-conjugate high-latitude ground magnetometer data show very large Pi2 (δH~150 nT) with a 6-s time delay compared to the THEMIS ion injections. (3) Low-latitude ground magnetometer data also show Pi2 with the same waveform as the high-latitude Pi2 but with longer time delays (20-31 s). (4) Auroral luminosity was periodically modulated during the intensification phase. (5) All three signatures (ion injections, ground Pi2, optical modulation) had the same periodicity of ~135 s but with various time delays with respect to the THEMIS ion injections. These observations demonstrate that the three substorm phenomena had a common source which controlled the periodicity., Analytic models based on spherical and ellipsoidal gravitational collapse have been used to derive the mass functions of dark matter haloes and their progenitors (the conditional mass function). The ellipsoidal model generally provides a better match to simulation results, but there has been no simple analytic expression in this model for the conditional mass function that is accurate for small time-steps, a limit that is important for generating halo merger trees and computing halo merger rates. We remedy the situation by deriving accurate analytic formulae for the first-crossing distribution, the conditional mass function and the halo merger rate in the ellipsoidal collapse model in the limit of small look-back times. We show that our formulae provide a closer match to the Millennium simulation results than those in the spherical collapse model and the ellipsoidal model of Sheth and Tormen., We present the results of a systematic search for transiting planets in a ~5 Myr open cluster, NGC 2362. We observed ~1200 candidate cluster members, of which ~475 are believed to be genuine cluster members, for a total of ~100 h. We identify 15 light curves with reductions in flux that pass all our detection criteria, and six of the candidates have occultation depths compatible with a planetary companion. The variability in these six light curves would require very large planets to reproduce the observed transit depth. If we assume that none of our candidates are, in fact, planets then we can place upper limits on the fraction of stars with hot Jupiters (HJs) in NGC 2362. We obtain 99 per cent confidence upper limits of 0.22 and 0.70 on the fraction of stars with HJs (f<SUB>p</SUB>) for 1-3 and 3-10 d orbits, respectively, assuming all HJs have a planetary radius of 1.5R<SUB>Jup</SUB>. These upper limits represent observational constraints on the number of stars with HJs at an age &lt;~10 Myr, when the vast majority of stars are thought to have lost their protoplanetary discs. Finally, we extend our results to the entire Monitor project, a survey searching young, open clusters for planetary transits, and find that the survey as currently designed should be capable of placing upper limits on f<SUB>p</SUB> near the observed values of f<SUB>p</SUB> in the solar neighbourhood., A major question in the study of black hole binaries involves our understanding of the accretion geometry when the sources are in the ``hard'' state, with an X-ray energy spectrum dominated by a hard power-law component and radio emission coming from a steady ``compact'' jet. Although the common hard state picture is that the accretion disk is truncated, perhaps at hundreds of gravitational radii (R<SUB>g</SUB>) from the black hole, recent results for the recurrent transient GX 339-4 by Miller and coworkers show evidence for disk material very close to the black hole's innermost stable circular orbit. That work studied GX 339-4 at a luminosity of ~5% of the Eddington limit (L<SUB>Edd</SUB>) and used parameters from a relativistic reflection model and the presence of a thermal component as diagnostics. Here we use similar diagnostics but extend the study to lower luminosities (2.3% and 0.8% L<SUB>Edd</SUB>) using Swift and RXTE observations of GX 339-4. We detect a thermal component with an inner disk temperature of ~0.2 keV at 2.3% L<SUB>Edd</SUB>. At both luminosities, we detect broad features due to iron Kα that are likely related to reflection of hard X-rays off disk material. If these features are broadened by relativistic effects, they indicate that the material resides within 10R<SUB>g</SUB>, and the measurements are consistent with the disk's inner radius remaining at ~4R<SUB>g</SUB> down to 0.8% L<SUB>Edd</SUB>. However, we also discuss an alternative model for the broadening, and we note that the evolution of the thermal component is not entirely consistent with the constant inner radius interpretation., Redshift distortion measurements from galaxy surveys include sensitivity to the gravitational growth index distinguishing other theories from Einstein gravity. This gravitational sensitivity is substantially free from uncertainty in the effective equation of state of the cosmic expansion history. We estimate the future sensitivity and complementarity of this technique exploring the growth history of the universe. We also illustrate the bias in the traditional application to matter density determination using f=Ω<SUB>m</SUB>(a)<SUP>0.6</SUP>, and how to avoid it., According to Burrows et al.'s acoustic mechanism for core-collapse supernova explosions, the primary, l = 1, g-mode in the core of the proto-neutron star is excited to an energy of ~10<SUP>50</SUP>erg and damps by the emission of sound waves. Here we calculate the damping of the primary mode by the parametric instability, i.e. by non-linear, three-mode coupling between the low-order primary mode and pairs of high-order g-modes. We show that the primary mode is strongly coupled to highly resonant, neutrino damped pairs with n &gt;~ 10; such short wavelength interactions cannot be resolved in the simulations. We find that the parametric instability saturates the primary mode energy at ~10<SUP>48</SUP>erg, well below the energy needed to drive an explosion. We therefore conclude that acoustic power is unlikely to be energetically significant in core-collapse supernova explosions., I discuss observational clues concerning episodic mass-loss properties of massive stars in the time before the final supernova explosion. In particular, I will focus on the mounting evidence that LBVs and related stars are candidates for supernova progenitors, even though current paradigms place them at the end of core-H burning. Namely, conditions in the immediate circumstellar environment within a few 10<SUP>2</SUP> AU of Type IIn supernovae require very high progenitor mass-loss rates. Those rates are so high that the only known stars that come close are LBVs during rare giant eruptions. I will highlight evidence from observations of some recent extraordinary supernovae suggesting that explosive or episodic mass loss (a.k.a. LBV eruptions like the 19th century eruption of Eta Car) occur in the 5-10 years immediately preceding the SN. Finally, I will discuss some implications for stellar evolution from these SNe, the most important of which is the observational fact that the most massive stars can indeed make it to the ends of their lives with substantial H envelopes intact, even at Solar metallicity., We analyze Faraday rotation and depolarization of extragalactic radio point sources in the direction of the inner Galactic plane to determine the outer scale and amplitude of the rotation measure power spectrum. Structure functions of rotation measure show lower amplitudes than expected when extrapolating electron density fluctuations to large scales assuming a Kolmogorov spectral index. This implies an outer scale of those fluctuations on the order of a parsec, much smaller than commonly assumed. Analysis of the partial depolarization of point sources independently indicates a small outer scale of a Kolmogorov power spectrum. In the Galaxy's spiral arms, no rotation measure fluctuations on scales above a few parsecs are measured. In the interarm regions fluctuations on larger scales than in spiral arms are present, and show power-law behavior with a shallow spectrum. These results suggest that in the spiral arms stellar sources such as stellar winds or protostellar outflows dominate the energy injection for the turbulent energy cascade on parsec scales, while in the interarm regions supernova and superbubble explosions are the main sources of energy on scales on the order of 100 pc., We present evidence for the formation of dust grains in an unusual Type Ib supernova (SN) based on late-time spectra of SN 2006jc. The progenitor suffered an outburst qualitatively similar to those of luminous blue variables (LBVs) just 2 yr prior to the SN, and we propose that the dust formation is a consequence of the SN blast wave overtaking that LBV-like shell. The key evidence for dust formation is (1) the appearance of a red/near-infrared continuum emission source that can be fit by T ≈ 1600 K graphite grains, and (2) fading of the redshifted sides of intermediate-width He I emission lines, yielding progressively more asymmetric blueshifted lines as dust obscures receding material. This provides the strongest case yet for dust formation in any SN Ib/c. Both developments occurred between 51 and 75 days after peak brightness, while the few other SNe observed to form dust did so after a few hundred days. Geometric considerations indicate that dust formed in the dense swept-up shell between the forward and reverse shocks, and not in the freely expanding SN ejecta. The rapid cooling leading to dust formation may have been aided by extremely high shell densities of 10<SUP>10</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, indicated by He I line ratios. The brief epoch of dust formation is accompanied by He II λ4686 emission and enhanced X-ray emission, suggesting a common link. These clues imply that the unusual dust formation in this object was not attributable to properties of the SN itself, but instead—like most peculiarities of SN 2006jc—was a consequence of interaction with the dense environment created by an LBV-like eruption 2 yr before the SN., We have measured the Zeeman splitting of OH megamaser emission at 1667 MHz from five (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies ([U]LIRGs) using the 305 m Arecibo telescope and the 100 m Green Bank Telescope. Five of eight targeted galaxies show significant Zeeman splitting detections, with 14 individual masing components detected and line-of-sight magnetic field strengths ranging from simeq0.5 to 18 mG. The detected field strengths are similar to those measured in Galactic OH masers, suggesting that the local process of massive star formation occurs under similar conditions in (U)LIRGs and the Galaxy, in spite of the vastly different large-scale environments. Our measured field strengths are also similar to magnetic field strengths in (U)LIRGs inferred from synchrotron observations, implying that milligauss magnetic fields likely pervade most phases of the interstellar medium in (U)LIRGs. These results provide a promising new tool for probing the astrophysics of distant galaxies., The RHESSI solar aspect sensors (SAS) serendipitously provide precise measures of the shape of the Sun at 670 nm. The data rate is high (more than 106 points since launch in 2002), and each point has a statistical precision of the order of 10 mas. We present reduced data from a three-month interval in 2004. The full data gives an oblateness (axisymmetric quadrupole shape term, expressed as the difference between equatorial and polar radii) of 10.74 ± 0.44 mas. For comparison, Dicke's 1970 estimate, based on uniform rotation, predicted 8.10 mas. The apparent radius strongly correlates with the EUV limb brightness. Accordingly, by restricting the data base to avoid faculae, including a component outside the active regions, we obtain a lower value for the oblateness. We find a value of 7.98 ± 0.14 mas. Based on a comparison of our results with previous balloon and satellite observations, the apparent excess oblateness may have a positive correlation with the solar cycle., Most flares show strong soft X-ray (SXR; &lt;20 keV) emission from a hot looptop source and hard X-ray (HXR; &gt;20 keV) emission from footpoint sources. The latter is generally interpreted as non-thermal bremsstrahlung from downward-accelerated coronal electrons impacting the denser chromosphere, where they deposit most of their kinetic energy as heat. Heated chromospheric material then rises and fills the flare loop - a process known as chromospheric evaporation (CE). Evidence for CE is given by crystal spectrometer observations of blueshifted spectral line emission from footpoints, suggesting upward motion of hot evaporated plasma. CE has often been thought to be the primary source of thermal looptop plasma. In large (GOES X-class) flares, non-thermal energy deposition can be as much as ~1e29~erg/s. For typical non-thermal electron energies, chromospheric densities, and footpoint areas, this input power should yield ~5-20~MK CE material at the footpoints, but with an emission measure calculated at ~1e50~cm- 3. Such bright thermal emission should be clearly visible in RHESSI imaging spectra of large flares, but no such emission has yet been observed. This suggests that while CE may indeed be the primary source of thermal loop plasma, heating by non-thermal electrons may be less efficient than once believed. A heating efficiency of only ~10-50% would result in a CE emission measure of only ~1e48~cm-3, which would be more consistent with observed footpoint fluxes. We present an analysis of selected RHESSI flares, ranging in GOES class from ~M1 to ~X17. We employ imaging spectroscopy to obtain spectra of spatially-separated footpoints and looptop sources to determine the strength of the thermal components in each. The time evolution of the thermal footpoint signatures is compared to that of the HXR emission as well as to the looptop thermal emission and temperature. We calculate the energy contained in non-thermal electrons, the thermal energies at the footpoints and the looptop, and discuss the implications for the efficiency of heating by non-thermal electrons and the contribution of chromospheric evaporation to the flare thermal plasma., Models developed under the Center for Integrated Space weather Modeling (CISM) represent one effort that is underway to realistically simulate the Sun's physical controls over interplanetary conditions, or heliospheric ""space weather"", in three dimensions. This capability is critical for interpreting the latest observations from STEREO, whose goal is to enable connections to be made between what is observed in the heliosphere via distributed in-situ measurements and what is observed in the corona and heliosphere via imaging from separated 1 AU perspectives. The ways in which the CISM models are enabling the exploitation of STEREO and other observations toward increased understanding of the solar wind and coronal activity and its consequences are described. In particular, the models allow the identification of the sources of structures in the solar wind, and analyses of how the coronal context of the observed CMEs plays a key role in determining the ultimate terrestrial (and other planetary) response ., The NASA Kepler EPO is contributing to the creation of three major curriculum projects: <P />Full Option Science System (FOSS) - Planetary Science Units for middle school <P />Great Explorations in Math and Science (GEMS) - Space Science Sequences for grades 3-5 and for grades 6-8 <P />Hands-On Universe (HOU) high school curriculum, A Changing Cosmos. <P />Both the GEMS and the FOSS units focus on topics starting with Earth-Sun-Moon system and expands to solar system and beyond. Both have well developed systems for student assessment. Both are infused with classroom activities that bring the science alive for students. <P />The HOU product is keyed to National Science Education Standards, and has a strong technology component in the Image Processing software investigations using real telescope images. <P />We summarize classroom activities and student investigations from all three projects. In particular, there are elements that drive home the science underlying the NASA Kepler mission to find Earth-size planets in the habitable zones of other stars., We have upgraded IRCAL, the near-infrared science camera of the Lick Observatory adaptive optics system, to add a dual-channel imaging polarimetry mode. This mode uses an optically contacted YLF (LiYF<SUB>4</SUB>) Wollaston prism to provide simultaneous images in perpendicular linear polarizations, providing high-resolution high-dynamic-range polarimetry in the near-infrared. We describe the design and construction of the polarimeter, discuss in detail the data reduction algorithms adopted, and evaluate the instrument’s on-the-sky performance. The IRCAL polarimeter is capable of reducing the stellar PSF halo by about 2 orders of magnitude, thereby increasing contrast for studies of faint circumstellar dust-scattered light. We discuss the various factors that limit the achieved contrast, and present lessons applicable to future high-contrast imaging polarimeters., On 2007-06-03 the five THEMIS spacecraft consecutively traversed the dayside (13.5 MLT) magnetopause during northward IMF with strong B<SUB>y</SUB>. While one spacecraft monitored the magnetosheath, the other four encountered an extended region of nearly-stagnant magnetosheath plasma attached to the magnetopause on closed field lines. This region was much denser than, but otherwise similar to, the nightside cold-dense plasma sheet. At two points in time this region was bordered by two spacecraft, revealing that its thickness grew from 0.65 R<SUB>E</SUB> to 0.9 R<SUB>E</SUB> in ~25 minutes. There was no evidence for Kelvin-Helmholtz waves nor diffusion at the local magnetopause. Our observations suggest that even when the IMF clock angle was as large as 60°, substantial solar wind entry across the dayside magnetopause occurred due to reconnection either poleward of both cusps or poleward of one cusp in one hemisphere and equatorward-of-the-cusp in the other., The RHESSI radius observations, made with its Solar Aspect Sensor (SAS), are providing our best characterization of the shape of the Sun. In spite of the differential nature of our measurement, which somewhat resembles that of Dicke's original (ground-based) Solar Oblateness Telescope, we still have a sensitivity in the radius measure to the presence of faculae and other small-scale magnetic features in the solar atmosphere. We find an clear positive correlation between radius and EUV brightness, as obtained from SOHO/EIT images; in addition we clearly see the Wilson Depression as a negative correlation. The facular correlation has been successfully used to screen RHESSI data from our initial study interval in 2004. We describe the nature of the correlation and discuss its interpretation., The ability to map the cosmological expansion has developed enormously, spurred by the turning point one decade ago of the discovery of cosmic acceleration. The standard model of cosmology has shifted from a matter dominated, standard gravity, decelerating expansion to the present search for the origin of acceleration in the cosmic expansion. We present a wide ranging review of the tools, challenges and physical interpretations. The tools include direct measures of cosmic scales through Type Ia supernova luminosity distances, and angular distance scales of baryon acoustic oscillation and cosmic microwave background density perturbations, as well as indirect probes such as the effect of cosmic expansion on the growth of matter density fluctuations. Accurate mapping of the expansion requires understanding of systematic uncertainties in both the measurements and the theoretical framework, but the result will give important clues to the nature of the physics behind accelerating expansion and to the fate of the universe., Geophysics, radio astronomy, Japan, the ionosphere, X and gamma rays: all have contributed to my view of how solar flares and their partner coronal mass ejections (CMEs) work. A solar flare (and a CME, it turns out) has an ""impulsive phase"" in which catastrophic and dominant energy release from magnetic storage takes place, resulting in particle acceleration. The impulsive restructuring of the coronal currents and fields leads directly (if still mysteriously) to the many observable phenomena, which can reach the surface of the Earth. In particular we now recognize that the term ""impulsive phase"" correctly captures the basic morphology of the process: it is highly intermittent in both space and time, even though it underlies large-scale phenomena such as CME eruptions. We still cannot resolve the scales of the flare intermittency, but we can use in-situ observations of possibly analogous processes in the solar wind and magnetosphere for guidance., The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) provides for the first time imaging spectroscopy of solar flares up to the γ-ray range. The three RHESSI flares with best counting statistics are analyzed in the 200-800 keV range revealing γ-ray emission produced by electron bremsstrahlung from footpoints of flare loops, but also from the corona. Footpoint emission dominates during the γ-ray peak, but as the γ-ray emission decreases the coronal source becomes more and more prominent. Furthermore, the coronal source shows a much harder spectrum (with power-law indices γ between 1.5 and 2) than the footpoints (with γ between 3 and 4). These observations suggest that flare-accelerated high-energy (~MeV) electrons stay long enough in the corona to lose their energy by collisions producing γ-ray emission, while lower energetic electrons precipitate more rapidly to the footpoints., Following the unstable ignition of carbon, but prior to explosion, a white dwarf (WD) in a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) undergoes a simmering phase. During this time, a central convective region grows and encompasses ~1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of the WD over a timescale of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> yr, which sets the thermal and turbulent profile for the subsequent explosion. We study this time-dependent convection and summarize some of the key features that differ from the traditional, steady-state case. We show that the long conductive timescale above the convective zone and the extraction of energy to heat the WD core lead to a decrease of the convective luminosity and the characteristic velocities near the convective zone's top boundary. In addition, differences in the composition between the convective core and the conductive exterior will significantly alter the location of this boundary. In this respect, we find the biggest effect to be due to complete <SUP>22</SUP>Ne sedimentation prior to carbon ignition. These effects add diversity to the possible WD models, which may alter the properties of SN Ia explosions., We present results of electric and magnetic field fluctuation spectras in 14 intervals observed in the ambient solar wind near 1 AU, using electric- and magnetic field and plasma measurements from Cluster and ACE spacecrafts. The main focus is particularly on the energy transfer in the small scales (k ρ &gt; 1), usually referred as ""dissipation range"" in literature. It is however likely that it is a second inertial range caused by the change in the dispersion relation as energy cascades to smaller wavelengths from Alfven waves in some nonlinear process and heats the surrounding plasma. In the inertial range electric and magnetic fluctuation spectras follow the classical fluid-like Kolmogorov behavior as is previously observed. The fluid-like behavior breaks down near the ion thermal gyro-radius ( ρi) and we observe an enhancement in the electric spectrum while the magnetic spectrum becomes steeper. We will also show how instrument noise affects the measured spectra and complicates the analysis of the underlying physics. Statistics of the observed intervals are presented. Special interest is paid to the in-situ measurements of the phase speed (vphi(k ρi)) of the turbulent plasma and comparison of the approximated dispersion of the waves to the theoretical predictions, goal being to find out the nature of the observed waves in the ""dissipation range""., We present new observations of Jupiter's ring system at a wavelength of 2.2 μm obtained with the 10-m W.M. Keck telescopes on three nights during a ring plane crossing: UT 19 December 2002, and 22 and 26 January 2003. We used conventional imaging, plus adaptive optics on the last night. Here we present detailed radial profiles of the main ring, halo and gossamer rings, and interpret the data together with information extracted from radio observations of Jupiter's synchrotron radiation. The main ring is confined to a 800-km-wide annulus between 128,200 and 129,000 km, with a ∼5000 km extension on the inside. The normal optical depth is 8×10, 15% of which is provided by bodies with radii a≳5 cm. These bodies are as red as Metis. Half the optical depth, τ≈4×10, is attributed to micron-sized dust, and the remaining τ≈3×10 to grains tens to hundreds of μm in size. The inward extension consists of micron-sized ( a≲10 μm) dust, which probably migrates inward under Poynting-Robertson drag. The inner limit of this extension falls near the 3:2 Lorentz resonance (at orbital radius r=122,400 km), and coincides with the outer limit of the halo. The gossamer rings appear to be radially confined, rather than broad sheets of material. The Amalthea ring is triangularly shaped, with a steep outer dropoff over ∼5000 km, extending a few 1000 km beyond the orbit of Amalthea, and a more gradual inner dropoff over 15,000-20,000 km. The inner edge is near the location of the synchronous orbit. The optical depth in the Amalthea ring is ∼5×10, up to 20% of which is comprised of macroscopic material. The optical depth in the Thebe ring is a factor of 3 smaller., Previously, Chua et al. [2004] computed substorm time scales for over three hundred substorms observed by the Polar Ultraviolet Imager (UVI). They found that statistically the substorm recovery time scales for substorms occurring near winter solstice and equinox (when the nighttime auroral zone was in darkness) was roughly twice as long as the recovery time scale for substorms occurring in the summer (when the nighttime auroral region was sunlit). These results strongly suggest that auroral substorms in the northern and southern hemispheres develop differently during solstice conditions with substorms lasting longer in the dark (winter) hemisphere than in the sunlit (summer) hemisphere. This also implies that more energy is deposited by electron precipitation in the winter hemisphere than in the summer one during substorms. Here, we extend this previous statistical work by analyzing the recovery time scales for simultaneous, conjugate auroral substorms observed by Polar UVI and IMAGE FUV. However, in order to quantitatively compare conjugate substorm time scales, we first inter-calibrate the two instruments by calculating the recovery time scales for both instruments while viewing ""same scene"" substorms to determine the effect of different temporal and spectral resolutions on the recovery time scales. We will discuss our inter-calibration procedure and present initial results of simultaneous, conjugate auroral substorm recovery time scales., The NASA Kepler EPO team has created models and simulations of planetary systems (orreries) to use in demonstrating the transit technique of finding exoplanets. The first successful orrery, consisting of a 3-planet orrery with an electric lamp (model star) at the center, and a Vernier light sensor system connected to a laptop computer with real-time graphing software, was first on display at the Kepler booth in a 2006 AAS conference. That system was extended to a 4-planet model (one planet with a moon as well) and has been on display at many astronomy and teacher education conferences in the past few years. Construction of duplicate models costs about $60 for LEGO parts, plus $100 or so for light sensor hardware and software. <P />The LEGO orrery effort stemmed from successful work in creating a large museum-grade orrery that was used in the Planet-Finding portion of the ""Alien Earths"" exhibit, a collaboration of Space Science Institute, NSF, NASA Kepler mission EPO and other NASA EPO groups. Replication of that model would cost in the neighborhood of $25,000. <P />In recent months, Kepler EPO has worked on design of a more rudimentary, inexpensive orrery made of cardboard, paper plates, wine corks, and rubber bands. Work is also underway on a new plastic-geared orrery for use in classrooms with a Full Option Science System (FOSS) Planetary Science Unit for middle school. This presentation relays results and status of these new developments in planetary model systems., The Transients Classification Pipeline (TCP) is a Berkeley-led project which federates data streams from multiple surveys and observatories, classifies with machine learning and astronomer defined science priors, and broadcasts sources of interest to various science clients (using the VOEvent protocol). The TCP is a production-level project, being developed to handle several upcoming data torrents (e.g. from the Palomar Transient Factory), and should be scalable to LSST volumes., Recent EBIT measurements and line identifications of astrophysically abundant elements (Fe VII - Fe X, Lepson et al. 2002, Ar IX- Ar XVI, Lepson et al 2003, S VII- S XIV, Lepson et al 2004) provide an opportunity to identify many of the previously unassigned lines in Procyon (Raassen et al, 2002). We use the combined HRC-S/LETG spectra of Procyon, reprocessed using the newest Chandra calibration files, and recent EBIT laboratory data to make line assignments and compare the Procyon data with the Solar EUV reference data (Hinteregger et al, 1981)., Currently, space physicists are faced with a bewildering array of heliospheric missions, experiments, and data sets available at archives distributed around the world. Daunting even for those most familiar with the field, physicists in other concentrations (solar physics, magnetospheric physics, etc.) find locating the heliospheric data that they need extremely challenging if not impossible. The Virtual Heliospheric Observatory (VHO) works to solve this problem by providing an Application Programming Interface (API) and web portal that integrates these data sets to find the highest quality data for a given task. The VHO requires a minimum set of metadata from each participating data provider. I discuss the experience of one such data provider and the benefits provided to users of my data., THEMIS observations at the sub-solar magnetopause reveal the structure of the low latitude boundary layer (LLBL) and magnetosheath boundary layer (MSBL) during northward IMF. Unlike previous single spacecraft observations of this region, four of the five THEMIS spacecraft were able to capture the transition of magnetosheath plasma with no electron heating to uni-directional heated electrons followed by bi-directional heated electrons, demonstrating that this electron structure is spatial. Furthermore, the sequence of these transitions shows that the bi-directional heated electrons appear at the outer edge of the weak magnetopause current sheet. Since heated magnetosheath electrons outside the magnetopause current layer are used as an indicator of lobe reconnection in the hemisphere radiating these electrons, reconnection in both lobes is observed before the flux tubes cross the magnetopause. In essence, these observations provide convincing evidence that the LLBL was formed by dual-lobe reconnection., We present observations of what may be the inner region of a lunar mini-magnetosphere. If so, these likely represent the first such observations. Previous studies of solar wind interaction with lunar crustal magnetic fields found increased particle fluxes associated with magnetic amplifications, suggesting a shock/sheath region. The central density cavity expected in the inner mini-magnetosphere (if analogous to other planetary magnetospheres) has proven elusive. We now present Lunar Prospector fly-throughs of a density cavity near a strong crustal magnetic source in the solar wind, and compare these unique observations with typical orbits in the solar wind and wake. We observed the density cavity on two consecutive orbits on July 14, 1999 with optimal viewing geometry, downstream from one of the strongest lunar crustal sources (an anomaly centered at ∼235E, 20S), during very unusual solar wind conditions. We found no other similar features in the solar wind in ∼7 months of low-altitude orbits, suggesting that fully formed lunar mini-magnetospheres are rare and/or difficult to observe from orbit., On 2007-06-03 the five THEMIS spacecraft consecutively traversed the dayside (13.5 MLT) magnetopause during northward IMF with strong By. While one spacecraft monitored the magnetosheath, the other four encountered a persistent and extended region of nearly-stagnant magnetosheath plasma attached to the magnetopause on closed field lines. This region was much denser than, but otherwise similar to, the nightside cold-dense plasma sheet. At one point this region was bordered by two spacecraft, allowing the direct determination of its thickness of 0.9 RE. There was no evidence for Kelvin-Helmholtz waves nor diffusion at the local magnetopause. The characteristics of the particle distributions suggest that substantial solar wind entry across the dayside magnetopause occurred as a result of reconnection in both cusps involving the same field lines, resulting in trapping of plasma on the nose of the magnetosphere, sunward of 13.5 MLT, even when the IMF clock angle was as large as 60 degrees., Accelerated electrons above tens of keV and accelerated ions above an MeV are observed to contain 10--50% of the energy released in solar flares. Recent analysis of RHESSI and SMM data has revealed a striking close linear correlation between the 2.223~MeV neutron-capture line and electron bremsstrahlung emission above 300~keV, which suggests that the acceleration of protons above ~30~MeV is linked to the acceleration of electrons above ~300~keV. We investigate the degree to which this correlation holds for electrons of lower energies by comparing the gamma-ray line emission with bremsstrahlung emission down to 50~keV, and we compare RHESSI results with past studies. The work at the University of California, Berkeley, was supported by NASA contract NAS 5-98033., A traditional picture for CME eruptions is that the closed magnetic fields underneath a helmet streamer are destabilized to produce a CME. At the tip of the streamer belt is the heliospheric plasma sheet (HPS) which is characterized by slow, dense and cold solar wind. An important point, missed by early CME observations, is that CMEs disrupting the streamer belt and moving through the HPS would be distorted into a concave-outward shape by the interaction with the HPS. For the first time, the interaction between CMEs and the preexisting HPS is clearly imaged by SECCHI and LASCO from the Sun out to several tens of solar radii. The 31 December 2007 CME first appears as a bulge swelling from the base of a streamer and pushing EUV plumes aside, consistent with the traditional scenario for CME initiation; the CME then quickly becomes concave-outward owing to the interaction with the preexisting HPS. The streamer reforms after the CME but seems a little displaced. A similar picture is observed for the 5 September 2005 CME. The CME source regions are underneath the streamer belt as revealed by the PFSS modeled coronal fields; an MHD model using the observed photospheric magnetic fields as input gives a bi-modal ambient solar wind, consistent with the observed concave-outward shape. We also discuss deflection flows ahead of the CMEs and how CMEs regulate the global field configuration of the Sun based on the observations. These results are important for understanding the complete picture of CME initiation and propagation., Realistic major SEP event modeling lags behind current efforts in CME/ICME modeling at this point in time. While on the surface the implementation of such models might seem straightforward, in practice there are many aspects of their construction that make progress slow. Part of the difficulty stems from the complex physics of the problem, some of which remains controversial, and part is simply related to the logistics of coupling the various concepts of acceleration and transport to the increasingly realistic MHD models of CMEs and ICMEs. Before a Strategic Capability in SEP event modeling can begin to be realized, the latter challenge must be addressed. Several groups, including CISM, CSEM and the LWS TR&amp;T Focus Science Team on the subject have been grappling with this ostensibly more tractable part of the problem. This presentation is an effort to collect and communicate the challenges faced in the course of applying MHD results in various approaches. One goal is to suggest what MHD model improvements and products would be most useful toward this goal. Another is to highlight the realities of compromises that must necessarily be made in the SEP event models regardless of the perfection of the MHD descriptions of CMEs and ICMEs., We show that several GRB correlations have common features indicative of an origin in selection effects. We focus on the possible origin of the Epk-Eiso correlation in Swift data due to detector threshold truncation. The existence of faint Swift events calls into question inferences based on pre-Swift surveys which must be subject to complicated incompleteness effects. Also, we show that the Epk-E<SUB>γ</SUB> (``Ghirlanda'') correlation is effectively independent of the GRB redshifts z, which suggests it contains little intrinsic physics., During accretion, a neutron star (NS) is spun up as angular momentum is transported through its liquid surface layers. We study the resulting differentially rotating profile, focusing on the impact this has for type I X-ray bursts. The viscous heating is found to be negligible, but turbulent mixing can be activated. Mixing has the greatest impact when the buoyancy at the compositional discontinuity between accreted matter and ashes is overcome. This occurs preferentially at high accretion rates or low spin frequencies and may depend on the ash composition from the previous burst. We then find two new regimes of burning. The first is ignition in a layer containing a mixture of heavier elements with recurrence times as short as ~5-30 minutes, similar to short recurrence time bursts. When mixing is sufficiently strong, a second regime is found where accreted helium mixes deep enough to burn stably, quenching X-ray bursts altogether. The carbon-rich material produced by stable helium burning would be important for triggering and fueling superbursts., We have investigated ICME activity during the solar activity minimum from March 2007 to December 2007 using observations from the STEREO and Wind spacecraft. During this period the angular separation of the twin STEREO satellites increased from about 1 to 44 degrees while Wind was located at the L1 point. At solar minimum the interplanetary medium is dominated by recurrent high-speed streams, but slow solar wind frequently includes ICME events. These slow ICMEs tend to have shorter durations and weaker magnetic fields than typical ICMEs at 1 AU. We will discuss the properties of these small ICMEs and their scale-sizes. In addition we will relate the ICMEs to the large-scale coronal structure using the GONG magnetogram synoptic maps. We also discuss the possible connection of these events to the transient outflows from coronal streamers identified originally by SOHO/LASCO and currently observed by the STEREO/SECCHI imagers., Accreting black holes (BHs) produce a steady compact jet when they are in hard states with a high level of timing noise and a hard X-ray spectrum. As this is the only time that steady jets are seen from Galactic BHs, studies of this state provide an opportunity to improve our understanding of the disk conditions necessary to launch jets. We are taking advantage of this opportunity by carrying out a multi-wavelength program to observe BH transients as they are entering the hard state and the compact jet is turning on. One of our recent projects is a study of radio-to-X-ray spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the microquasar GRO J1655-40. Novel aspects of the study include obtaining mid-IR coverage with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which we used to constrain the level of synchrotron emission from the jet. Also, we fitted the hard state SEDs with a physical compact jet model. Here, we describe our results for GRO J1655-40 as well as results from our broader observational BH program., Many recent discoveries relating to the behavior of the middle and low ionosphere/thermosphere (IT) system have relied upon one or more particular imaging techniques in combination with other data sources and modeling to answer scientific questions. The deployment of space-based instruments sensitive to far-ultraviolet and infrared emissions of the IT system has led to several important breakthroughts in understanding, while ground-based systems have become more numerous and optically capable. GPS receivers distributed globally or in dense regional networks have also provided detailed views of a variety of ionospheric phenomena. These networks of imagers have been used in a number of coordinated studies to understand the new phenomena that they've revealed. A number of these phenomena, occurring under both ordinary and extreme geomagnetic conditions, remain in large part unexplained. Continued progress requires new research and capabilites in key areas, to be discussed., Traditionally, Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) models have used low-degree spherical harmonic transforms to calculate magnetic fields and estimate the large-scale coronal structure. This has been for two reasons; first, low-resolution data restricted the maximum degree of the transforms and second, the global magnetic structures of interest only required a low-degree expansion due to their distance from the photosphere. One of the most important applications of PFSS models has been to determine where open coronal field lines intersect the photosphere. However, the magnetic field near the solar surface is far more structured than can be accurately described by low-degree models. The combination of PFSS models capable of high-degree transforms and data from high-resolution solar imaging facilities is required to accurately determine the photospheric foot-point locations of coronal field lines. We present preliminary results from a new PFSS model that is capable of matching the spatial resolution of the MDI synoptic magnetograms used as input. We compare results to lower-degree models, and show how variations in the maximum spherical harmonic degree (l&gt;1000) affect field line locations at the photosphere. We also discuss the computational difficulties inherent in these calculations., With Swift detecting close to 100 new gamma-ray bursts each year, cataloging past bursts is more important than ever. To this end, we present a new online database (GRBOX: Gamma Ray Burst Online IndeX) indexing properties of every well-localized GRB since 1997. Unlike existing resources, the information in the catalog is presented to the user in the form of a sortable, filterable table and derives information for each burst from published catalogs as well as the GCN circulars and refereed publications. Short text summaries and links to other resources are also provided for every event., STEREO's IMPACT (In-situ Measurements of Particles and CME Transients) investigation provides the first opportunity for long duration, detailed observations of 1 AU magnetic field structures, plasma and suprathermal electrons, and energetic particles at points bracketing Earth's heliospheric location. The IMPACT team has developed both human-friendly web portals and API's (application program interfaces) which provide straight- foward data access to scientists and the Virtual Observatories. Several new data products and web features have been developed including the release of more and higher-level data products, a library of TPLOT-based IDL data analysis routines, and web sites devoted to event analysis and inter-mission and inter-disciplinary collaboration. A web browser integrating STEREO and L1 in situ data with imaging and models provides a powerful venue for exploring the Sun-Earth connection. These latest releases enable the larger scientific community to use STEREO's unique in-situ data in novel ways along side ""third eye"" data sets from Wind, ACE and other heliospheric missions contributing to a better understanding of three dimensional structures in the solar wind., The transfer of turbulent energy through an inertial range from the driving scale to dissipative scales in a kinetic plasma followed by the conversion of this energy into heat is a fundamental plasma physics process. A theoretical foundation for the study of this process is constructed, but the details of the kinetic cascade are not well understood. Several important properties are identified: (a) The conservation of a generalized energy by the cascade; (b) the need for collisions to increase entropy and realize irreversible plasma heating; and (c) the key role played by the entropy cascade-a dual cascade of energy to small scales in both physical and velocity space-to convert ultimately the turbulent energy into heat. A strategy for nonlinear numerical simulations of kinetic turbulence is outlined. Initial numerical results are consistent with the operation of the entropy cascade. Inertial range turbulence arises in a broad range of space and astrophysical plasmas and may play an important role in the thermalization of fusion energy in burning plasmas., As part of an effort to understand the origin of open clusters, we present a statistical analysis of the currently observed Pleiades. Starting with a photometric catalog of the cluster, we employ a maximum likelihood technique to determine the mass distribution of its members, including single stars and both components of binary systems. We find that the overall binary fraction for unresolved pairs is 68%. Extrapolating to include resolved systems, this fraction climbs to about 76%, significantly higher than the accepted field star result. Both figures are sensitive to the cluster age, for which we have used the currently favored value of 125 Myr. The primary and secondary masses within binaries are correlated, in the sense that their ratios are closer to unity than under the hypothesis of random pairing. We map out the spatial variation of the cluster's projected and three-dimensional mass and number densities. Finally, we revisit the issue of mass segregation in the Pleiades. We find unambiguous evidence of segregation, and introduce a new method for quantifying it., Using 8-10-m class telescopes and their Adaptive Optics (AO) systems, we conducted a long-term adaptive optics campaign initiated in 2003 focusing on four binary asteroid systems: (130) Elektra, (283) Emma, (379) Huenna, and (3749) Balam. The analysis of these data confirms the presence of their asteroidal satellite. We did not detect any additional satellite around these systems even though we have the capability of detecting a loosely-bound fragment (located at 1/4×R) ∼40 times smaller in diameter than the primary. The orbits derived for their satellites display significant eccentricity, ranging from 0.1 to 0.9, suggesting a different origin. Based on AO size estimate, we show that (130) Elektra and (283) Emma, G-type and P-type asteroids, respectively, have a significant porosity (30-60% considering CI-CO meteorites as analogs) and their satellite's eccentricities ( e∼0.1) are possibly due to excitation by tidal effects. (379) Huenna and (3749) Balam, two loosely bound binary systems, are most likely formed by mutual capture. (3749) Balam's possible high bulk density is similar to (433) Eros, another S-type asteroid, and should be poorly fractured as well. (379) Huenna seems to display both characteristics: the moonlet orbits far away from the primary in term of stability ( 20%×R), but the primary's porosity is significant (30-60%)., We demonstrate that the low frequency broadband magnetic fluctuations observed during THEMIS spacecraft traversals near the Earth's magnetopause may be described as a turbulent spectrum of Doppler shifted kinetic Alfvén waves (KAWs). These waves are most intense along reconnected flux-tubes in the magnetosheath just outside the magnetopause. We identify distinct power-law scalings of wave spectral energy density in wavenumber and show that Landau (LD) and transit time damping (TD) on ions and electrons is largest at the wavenumber where the power-law index changes. The threshold amplitude for stochastic ion scattering/acceleration is also exceeded by these waves. These acceleration processes are manifest in observations of field-aligned and transverse heating of electrons and ions respectively. From integration over the range of observed wavenumbers we show that, if the wave-normal angles are sufficiently large, these waves can provide diffusive transport of magnetosheath plasmas across the magnetopause at up to the Bohm rate., The Sun is the most energetic particle accelerator in the solar system. Observations of hard X-ray/gamma-ray continuum and gamma-ray line emission show that electrons are accelerated to &gt;~ 100s of MeV and ions up to GeV energies, respectively, in large solar flares. Direct in situ observations of solar energetic particles (SEPs) near 1 AU suggest that shock waves driven by fast (&gt;1000 km/s) coronal mass ejections (CMEs) accelerate ions and electrons to similar energies, at altitudes of ~2 to 40 solar radii. Both CMEs and large flares involve the transient release of up to 10e32-10e33 ergs. The flare-accelerated tens of keV electrons and &gt;MeV ions often containing 10-50% or more of the total energy released, indicating the particle acceleration is intimately related to the energy release mechanism. RHESSI (Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager) observations show strong evidence for both the ion and electron acceleration and the energy release in flares to be associated with the process of magnetic reconnection. Electron acceleration to &gt;~10 keV is observed in small flares and even in microflares that occur as often as every several minutes near solar maximum. Radio type III bursts indicate that electron acceleration can occur high in the corona, often without flare signatures at lower altitude. At 1 AU, hundreds of small impulsive SEP events dominated by &lt;1 to 100 keV electrons and often accompanied by tens of keV to MeV/nuc ions, strongly enriched in 3He and heavies, are detected per year near solar maximum. Here I review the recent RHESSI and related in situ observations as they bear on the fundamental acceleration processes that are occurring, and discuss the prospects for key measurements from future space missions., This paper studies the turbulent cascade of magnetic energy in weakly collisional magnetized plasmas. A cascade model is presented, based on the assumptions of local nonlinear energy transfer in wave number space, critical balance between linear propagation and nonlinear interaction times, and the applicability of linear dissipation rates for the nonlinearly turbulent plasma. The model follows the nonlinear cascade of energy from the driving scale in the MHD regime, through the transition at the ion Larmor radius into the kinetic Alfvén wave regime, in which the turbulence is dissipated by kinetic processes. The turbulent fluctuations remain at frequencies below the ion cyclotron frequency due to the strong anisotropy of the turbulent fluctuations, k<SUB>∥</SUB> ≪ k<SUB>⊥</SUB> (implied by critical balance). In this limit, the turbulence is optimally described by gyrokinetics; it is shown that the gyrokinetic approximation is well satisfied for typical slow solar wind parameters. Wave phase velocity measurements are consistent with a kinetic Alfvén wave cascade and not the onset of ion cyclotron damping. The conditions under which the gyrokinetic cascade reaches the ion cyclotron frequency are established. Cascade model solutions imply that collisionless damping provides a natural explanation for the observed range of spectral indices in the dissipation range of the solar wind. The dissipation range spectrum is predicted to be an exponential fall off; the power-law behavior apparent in observations may be an artifact of limited instrumental sensitivity. The cascade model is motivated by a program of gyrokinetic simulations of turbulence and particle heating in the solar wind., Recent far-ultraviolet (FUV) observations of Earth have shown the remarkable spatial correspondence between the amplitude of non-migrating atmospheric tides originating in the troposphere and the density and morphology of the nighttime equatorial ionospheric anomaly (EIA). This is likely a result of the modulation of the E-region dynamo electric field in daytime by the tidal winds. In FUV observations around the time of the vernal equinox of 2002, the signature of tidal influence; a wave-4 periodicity in the separation and density of the two EIA bands, itself exhibits significant temporal variability. Here, we seek to understand this variability, and whether (or not) it is linked to variations in the strength of the upward-propagating tides. This study relies on tidal measurements provided by the global observations from the TIMED-SABER instrument that measures the temperature variations in the MLT associated with the upward-propagating tides. TIMED-GUVI provides F-region density measurements concurrent to the MLT temperature retrievals. It is found that the atmospheric and ionospheric zonal wave-4 signatures very nearly covary over a 30-day period, strongly supporting the theory that the dirunal eastward 3 (DE3) tide originating in the troposphere has effects extending to the F-layer of the ionosphere. Additionally, a 6- day periodicity in the power of the ionospheric wave-4 signature is found that may originate with the tide's interaction with longer period planetary waves., After commenting briefly on the role of the typicality assumption in science, we advocate a phenomenological approach to the cosmological measure problem. Like any other theory, a measure should be simple, general, well defined, and consistent with observation. This allows us to proceed by elimination. As an example, we consider the proper time cutoff on a geodesic congruence. It predicts that typical observers are quantum fluctuations in the early universe, or Boltzmann babies. We sharpen this well-known youngness problem by taking into account the expansion and open spatial geometry of pocket universes. Moreover, we relate the youngness problem directly to the probability distribution for observables, such as the temperature of the cosmic background radiation. We consider a number of modifications of the proper time measure, but find none that would make it compatible with observation., IC 10 X-1 is a variable X-ray source in the Local Group starburst galaxy IC 10 whose optical counterpart is a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star. Prestwich and coworkers recently proposed that it contains the most massive known stellar-mass black hole (23-34 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), but their conclusion was based on radial velocities derived from only a few optical spectra, the most important of which was seriously affected by a CCD defect. Here we present new spectra of the WR star, spanning 1 month, obtained with the Keck I 10 m telescope. The spectra show a periodic shift in the He II λ 4686 emission line as compared with IC 10 nebular lines such as [O III] λ 5007. From this, we calculate a period of 34.93 +/- 0.04 hr (consistent with the X-ray period of 34.40 +/- 0.83 hr reported by Prestwich) and a radial velocity semiamplitude of 370 +/- 20 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The resulting mass function is 7.64 +/- 1.26 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, consistent with that of Prestwich (7.8 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). This, combined with the previously estimated (from spectra) mass of 35 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> for the WR star, yields a minimum primary mass of 32.7 +/- 2.6 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Even if the WR star has a mass of only 17 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, the minimum primary mass is 23.1 +/- 2.1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Thus, IC 10 X-1 is indeed a WR/black-hole binary containing the most massive known stellar-mass black hole., A white dwarf (WD) gains substantial angular momentum during the accretion process that grows it toward a Chandrasekhar mass. It is therefore expected to be rotating quickly when it ignites as a Type Ia supernova. The thermal and shearing profiles are important for subsequent flame propagation. We highlight processes that could affect the WD shear during accretion, as well as during the ~1000 yr of pre-explosive simmering. Baroclinic instabilities and/or the shear growth of small magnetic fields provide sufficient torque to bring the WD very close to solid-body rotation during accretion. The lack of significant shear makes it difficult to grow a WD substantially past the typical Chandrasekhar mass. Once carbon ignites, a convective region spreads from the center of the WD. This phase occurs regardless of progenitor scenario, and therefore it is of great interest for understanding how the WD interior is prepared before the explosive burning begins. We summarize some of the key properties of the convective region, including a demonstration that the mass enclosed by convection at any given time depends most sensitively on a single parameter that can be expressed as either the ratio of temperatures or densities at the top and bottom of the convection zone. At low Rossby numbers, the redistribution of angular momentum by convection may result in significant shearing at the convective/nonconvective boundary., We used the Near Infrared Camera on Keck I to obtain K<SUB>s</SUB> -band images of four candidate high-redshift radio galaxies selected using optical and radio data in the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey in Boötes. Our targets have 1.4 GHz radio flux densities greater than 1 mJy, but are undetected in the optical to gsim24 Vega mag. Spectral energy distribution fitting suggests that three of these objects are at z &gt; 3, with radio luminosities near the FR-I/FR-II break. The other has photometric redshift z <SUB>phot</SUB> = 1.2, but may in fact be at higher redshift. Two of the four objects exhibit diffuse morphologies in K<SUB>s</SUB> -band, suggesting that they are still in the process of forming., We construct merger trees from the largest data base of dark matter haloes to date provided by the Millennium Simulation to quantify the merger rates of haloes over a broad range of descendant halo mass (10<SUP>12</SUP> &lt;~ M<SUB>0</SUB> &lt;~ 10<SUP>15</SUP>M<SUB>Ȯ</SUB>), progenitor mass ratio (10<SUP>-3</SUP> &lt;~ ξ &lt;= 1), and redshift (0 &lt;= z &lt;~ 6). We find the mean merger rate per halo, B/n, to have very simple dependence on M<SUB>0</SUB>,ξ, and z, and propose a universal fitting form for B/n that is accurate to 10-20 per cent. Overall, B/n depends very weakly on the halo mass (~ M<SUP>0.08</SUP><SUB>0</SUB>) and scales as a power law in the progenitor mass ratio (~ ξ<SUP>-2</SUP>) for minor mergers (ξ &lt;~ 0.1) with a mild upturn for major mergers. As a function of time, we find the merger rate per Gyr to evolve roughly as (1 + z)<SUP>n<SUB>m</SUB></SUP> with n<SUB>m</SUB> = 2-2.3, while the rate per unit redshift is nearly independent of z. Several tests are performed to assess how our merger rates are affected by e.g. the time interval between Millennium outputs, binary versus multiple progenitor mergers, and mass conservation and diffuse accretion during mergers. In particular, we find halo fragmentations to be a general issue in merger tree construction from N-body simulations and compare two methods for handling these events. We compare our results with predictions of two analytical models for halo mergers based on the extended Press-Schechter (EPS) model and the coagulation theory. We find that the EPS model overpredicts the major merger rates and underpredicts the minor merger rates by up to a factor of a few., We use a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations to study the properties, abundance and clustering of high-mass haloes at high redshift, including their mass assembly histories and mergers. We find that the analytic form which best fits the abundance of haloes depends sensitively on the assumed definition of halo mass, with common definitions of halo mass differing by a factor of 2 for these low-concentration, massive haloes. A significant number of massive haloes are undergoing rapid mass accretion, with major merger activity being common. We compare the mergers and mass accretion histories to the extended Press-Schechter formalism. <P />We consider how major merger induced star formation or black hole accretion may change the distribution of photon production from collapsed haloes, and hence reionization, using some simplified examples. In all of these, the photon distribution for a halo of a given mass acquires a large scatter. If rare, high-mass haloes contribute significantly to the photon-production rates, the scatter in photon-production rate can translate into additional scatter in the sizes of ionized bubbles., The Suprathermal Electron (STE) instrument, part of the IMPACT investigation on both spacecraft of NASA’s STEREO mission, is designed to measure electrons from ∼2 to ∼100 keV. This is the primary energy range for impulsive electron/<SUP>3</SUP>He-rich energetic particle events that are the most frequently occurring transient particle emissions from the Sun, for the electrons that generate solar type III radio emission, for the shock accelerated electrons that produce type II radio emission, and for the superhalo electrons (whose origin is unknown) that are present in the interplanetary medium even during the quietest times. These electrons are ideal for tracing heliospheric magnetic field lines back to their source regions on the Sun and for determining field line lengths, thus probing the structure of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and of the ambient inner heliosphere. STE utilizes arrays of small, passively cooled thin window silicon semiconductor detectors, coupled to state-of-the-art pulse-reset front-end electronics, to detect electrons down to ∼2 keV with about 2 orders of magnitude increase in sensitivity over previous sensors at energies below ∼20 keV. STE provides energy resolution of Δ E/ E∼10 25% and the angular resolution of ∼20° over two oppositely directed ∼80°×80° fields of view centered on the nominal Parker spiral field direction., Eight basaltic lavas from the Auckland volcanic field, New Zealand, record three distinct sets of excursional geomagnetic field directions and low paleointensities, however the timing and therefore paleomagnetic significance of these records have been poorly understood. Radiocarbon, K-Ar, and thermoluminescence dating constrain these lavas to have erupted during the last 75 ka, a period during which as many as three excursions have been recorded differentially at several northern and fewer southern hemisphere sites. Forty <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>39</SUP>Ar incremental heating experiments conducted on groundmass from seven of these excursional lavas indicate that they erupted during at least two periods, at 39.1 ± 4.1 and 31.6 ± 1.8 ka, coincident with <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>39</SUP>Ar, astrochronologic, and <SUP>14</SUP>C ages determined for the Laschamp and Mono Lake excursions, respectively. Samples from a lava flow associated with a third cluster of virtual geomagnetic poles (VGPs) are complicated by low concentrations of radiogenic argon in the presence of excess argon, and thus yield discordant age spectra and an imprecise age of 26.6 ± 8.1 ka. Our findings indicate that the Laschamp and Mono Lake excursions, until recently identified unequivocally and isotopically dated only in the Northern Hemisphere, were globally synchronized at 40 ± 1 and 32 ± 1 ka. However, the VGPs of lavas that record the Laschamp excursion in New Zealand and France are inconsistent with a simple clockwise looping geometry inferred from VGP paths obtained in eight marine sediment cores spanning the Laschamp excursion. We suggest that the differences in VGPs recorded at the various sites are significant and may point to non-axial dipole components and lower mantle control on transitional fields during short-lived excursions., We report observations made by the Wind spacecraft in the distant magnetotail on 22-24 October 2003 when the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) was strongly northward for more than 32 h. A well-defined magnetotail was observed down to at least X<SUB> GSM </SUB> = -125 R<SUB> E </SUB> even after 32 h of strongly northward IMF conditions. However, the observed tail properties were strikingly different from the typical magnetotail. Although the closed field line plasma sheet was observed throughout the northward IMF interval, the usual mantle/lobe disappeared one hour after the northward IMF front reached the frontside magnetopause. Instead, open field lines were observed populated by field-aligned solar wind strahl electrons as well as plasma sheet electrons predominantly at 90° pitch angle. In essence, these observations provide evidence for reconnection between the IMF and a previously closed nightside cold dense plasma sheet during long periods of northward IMF, after poleward-of-the-cusp reconnection has depleted all open lobe field lines., We present in situ observations of the source regions of interplanetary (IP) type II radio bursts, using data from the Wind spacecraft during the period 1996-2002. We show the results of this survey, as well as in-depth analysis of several individual events. Each event analyzed in detail is associated with an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) and an IP shock driven by the ICME. Immediately prior to the arrival of each shock, electron beams along the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and associated Langmuir waves are detected, implying magnetic connection to a quasi-perpendicular shock front acceleration site. These observations are analogous to those made in the terrestrial foreshock region, indicating that a similar foreshock region exists on IP shock fronts. The analogy suggests that the electron acceleration process is a fast Fermi process, and this suggestion is borne out by loss cone features in the electron distribution functions. The presence of a foreshock region requires nonplanar structure on the shock front. Using Wind burst mode data, the foreshock electrons are analyzed to estimate the dimensions of the curved region. We present the first measurement of the lateral, shock-parallel scale size of IP foreshock regions. The presence of these regions on IP shock fronts can explain the fine structure often seen in the spectra of type II bursts., Field and plasma measurements from three THEMIS spacecraft are compared during a back-and-forth crossing of an asymmetric, reconnecting, sub-solar magnetopause to explain the apparent absence of the quadrupolar magnetic field and part of the bipolar electric field that are found during symmetric magnetic field reconnection. The differences in the reconnection magnetic fields in the asymptotic regions (a factor of three) and the plasma densities (a factor of 30) combine to make the Hall MHD term and the resulting Hall electric field in the Generalized Ohm's law significant only on the magnetospheric side of the magnetopause. Qualitative analysis indicates that the single particle and fluid trajectories in such fields are different from those in the case of symmetric boundary conditions., The STEREO mission’s Education and Outreach (E/PO) program began early enough its team benefited from many lessons learned as NASA’s E/PO profession matured. Originally made up of discrete programs, by launch the STEREO E/PO program had developed into a quality suite containing all the program elements now considered standard: education workshops, teacher/student guides, national and international collaboration, etc. The benefit of bringing so many unique programs together is the resulting diverse portfolio, with scientists, E/PO professionals, and their education partners all of whom can focus on excellent smaller programs. The drawback is a less cohesive program nearly impossible to evaluate in its entirety with the given funding. When individual components were evaluated, we found our programs mostly made positive impact. In this paper, we elaborate on the programs, hoping that others will effectively use or improve upon them. When possible, we indicate the programs’ effects on their target audiences., At near ambient conditions, CaIrO <SUB>3</SUB> is isostructural with the high-pressure polymorph MgSiO <SUB>3</SUB> ""post-perovskite"" (pPv). MgSiO <SUB>3</SUB> pPv is thought to be a major phase in the earth's lowermost mantle. CaIrO <SUB>3</SUB> can thus serve as an analog for studying deformation of the pPv phase under conditions achievable with a multi-anvil deformation apparatus. Here we study the rheologic behavior of CaIrO <SUB>3</SUB> pPv at a variety of pressure and temperature conditions from 2 GPa to 6 GPa and 300 K to 1300 K and various strain rates. Sintered, polycrystalline CaIrO <SUB>3</SUB> pPv, cylindrical in shape, was deformed in the D-DIA multi-anvil press in several shortening cycles up to 20% axial strain at each temperature and pressure. Shortening cycles were followed by lengthening back to 0% strain. Quantitative texture information was obtained using in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and the Rietveld method to analyze images. In all cases we find that (010) lattice planes align perpendicular to the compression direction upon shortening, and that there is little change in texture with temperature or pressure. This texture pattern is consistent with slip on (010)[100]. The texture observed here is different from that produced in room temperature diamond anvil cell (DAC) experiments on MgGeO <SUB>3</SUB> and MgSiO <SUB>3</SUB> pPv which both display textures of (100) and {110} lattice planes at high angles to the compression direction. This implies that CaIrO <SUB>3</SUB> pPv may not be a good analog for the plastic behavior of MgSiO <SUB>3</SUB> pPv., The STEREO/WAVES experiment is designed to measure the electric component of radio emission from interplanetary radio bursts and in situ plasma waves and fluctuations in the solar wind. Interplanetary radio bursts are generated from electron beams at interplanetary shocks and solar flares and are observed from near the Sun to 1 AU, corresponding to frequencies of approximately 16 MHz to 10 kHz. In situ plasma waves occur in a range of wavelengths larger than the Debye length in the solar wind plasma λ <SUB> D </SUB>≈10 m and appear Doppler-shifted into the frequency regime down to a fraction of a Hertz. These phenomena are measured by STEREO/WAVES with a set of three orthogonal electric monopole antennas. This paper describes the electrical and mechanical design of the antenna system and discusses efforts to model the antenna pattern and response and methods for in-flight calibration., An essential component of the STEREO IMPACT investigation is its nearly 6 m long boom that provides several of the instruments with a sufficiently clean magnetic environment and minimally restricted fields of view, while having the required rigidity to ensure the spacecraft pointing accuracy for the STEREO imaging investigations. Details of the customized telescoping IMPACT Boom design, construction and testing are described in this review. The successful completion and verification of the IMPACT Booms represents a demonstration of the use of Stacers as motive forces for rigid boom deployment., We examine the first decade of adjustment of the North Atlantic climate following an abrupt freshening of the high North Atlantic and resulting slowdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) in a coupled model, with reference to previously proposed teleconnection mechanisms. After an initial ocean-driven cooling at the subtropical-subpolar gyre boundary, subsequent equatorward progression is dominated by an atmosphere-surface ocean mechanism driving evaporative cooling in the tropical North Atlantic, and resulting in an anomalous southward ITCZ displacement by year 2. The tropical cooling is countered by fast ocean baroclinic adjustment to the reduced overturning that increases the volume of tropical surface waters, as well as ocean circulation changes to the increased northeasterly trades. However, it is the atmosphere-surface ocean teleconnection that explains the hemispheric asymmetric nature of the tropical Atlantic surface climate impact to AMOC slowdown, underlining its crucial importance in high-to-low latitude teleconnections., , The THEMIS spacecraft encountered a Hot Flow Anomaly (HFA) on the dusk flank of the Earth's bow shock on 4 July 2007, observing it on both sides of the shock. Meanwhile, the THEMIS ground magnetometers traced the progress of the associated Magnetic Impulse Event along the dawn flank of the magnetosphere, providing a unique opportunity to study the transmission of the HFA through the shock and the subsequent downstream response. THEMIS-A, in the solar wind, observed classic HFA signatures. Isotropic electron distributions inside the upstream HFA are attributed to the action of the electron firehose instability. THEMIS-E, just downstream, observed a much more complex disturbance with the pressure perturbation decoupled from the underlying discontinuity. Simple calculations show that the pressure perturbation would be capable of significantly changing the magnetopause location, which is confirmed by the ground-based observations., We compare the chemical abundances at the sites of 12 nearby (z &lt; 0.14) Type Ic supernovae (SN Ic) that showed broad lines, but had no observed gamma-ray burst (GRB), with the chemical abundances in five nearby (z &lt; 0.25) galaxies at the sites of GRBs where broad-lined SN Ic were seen after the fireball had faded. It has previously been noted that GRB hosts are low in luminosity and low in their metal abundances. If low metallicity is sufficient to force the evolution of massive stars to end their lives as GRBs with an accompanying broad-lined SN Ic, then we would expect higher metal abundances for the broad-lined SN Ic that have no detected GRBs. This is what we observe, and this trend is independent of the choice of metallicity calibration we adopt and the mode of SN survey that found the broad-lined SN Ic. A unique feature of this analysis is that we present new spectra of the host galaxies and analyze all measurements of both samples in the same set of methods, using the galaxy emission-line measurements corrected for extinction and stellar absorption, via independent metallicity diagnostics of Kewley &amp; Dopita, McGaugh, and Pettini &amp; Pagel. In our small sample, the boundary between galaxies that have GRBs accompanying their broad-lined SN Ic and those that have broad-lined SN Ic without GRBs lies at an oxygen abundance of 12 + log(O/H)<SUB>KD02</SUB> ~ 8.5, which corresponds to 0.2-0.6 Z<SUB>sun</SUB> depending on the adopted metallicity scale and solar abundance value. Even when we limit the comparison to SN Ic that were found in untargeted supernova surveys, the environment of every broad-lined SN Ic that had no GRB is more metal rich than the site of any broad-lined SN Ic where a GRB was detected. <P />This paper includes data gathered with the MMT Observatory, a joint facility of the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Arizona, and with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile., Aims:We investigate particle acceleration and heating in a solar microflare. <BR />Methods: In a microflare with non-thermal emission to remarkably high energies (&gt;50 keV), we investigate the hard X-rays with RHESSI imaging and spectroscopy and the resulting thermal emission seen in soft X-rays with Hinode/XRT and in EUV with TRACE. <BR />Results: The non-thermal footpoints observed with RHESSI spatially and temporally match bright footpoint emission in soft X-rays and EUV. There is the possibility that the non-thermal spectrum extends down to 4 keV. The hard X-ray burst clearly does not follow the expected Neupert effect, with the time integrated hard X-rays not matching the soft X-ray time profile. So, although this is a simple microflare with good X-ray observation coverage it does not fit the standard flare model., We present the first in-depth statistical survey of all X-ray microflares observed by RHESSI between 2002 March and 2007 March, a total of 25,705 events, an order of magnitude larger then previous studies. These microflares were found using a new flare-finding algorithm designed to search the 6-12 keV count rate when RHESSI's full sensitivity was available in order to find the smallest events. The peak and total count rate are automatically obtained along with count spectra at the peak and the microflare centroid position. Our microflare magnitudes are below GOES C class, on average GOES A class (background subtracted). They are found to occur only in active regions, not in the ""quiet"" Sun, and are similar to large flares. The monthly average microflaring rate is found to vary with the solar cycle and ranges from 90 to 5 flares a day during active and quiet times, respectively. Most flares are found to be impulsive (74%), with rise times shorter than decay times. The mean flare duration is ~6 minutes with a 1 minute minimum set by the flare-finding algorithm. The frequency distributions of the peak count rate in the energy bands, 3-6, 6-12, and 12-25 keV, can be represented by power-law distributions with a negative power-law index of 1.50 +/- 0.03, 1.51 +/- 0.03, and 1.58 +/- 0.02, respectively. We find that these power-law indices are constant as a function of time. The X-ray photon spectra for individual events can be approximated with a power-law spectrum [dJ/d(hν) ~ (hν)<SUP>-γ</SUP>]. Using the ratio of photon fluxes between 10-15 and 15-20 keV, we find 4 &lt; γ &lt; 12, with an average of 7.4. Based on these values, the nonthermal power is calculated. The microflare occurrence frequency varies with the rate of energy release consistent with a power law with an exponent of -1.7 +/- 0.1. We estimate the total energy flux deposited in active regions by microflare-associated accelerated electrons (&gt;10 keV) over the five years of observations to be, on average, below 10<SUP>26</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>., Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are often assumed to be magnetic flux ropes, but direct proof has been lacking. A key feature, resulting from the translational symmetry of a flux rope, is that the total transverse pressure as well as the axial magnetic field has the same functional form over the vector potential along any crossing of the flux rope. We test this feature (and hence the flux-rope structure) by reconstructing the 2007 May 22 magnetic cloud (MC) observed at STEREO B, Wind/ACE, and possibly STEREO A with the Grad-Shafranov (GS) method. The model output from reconstruction at STEREO B agrees fairly well with the magnetic field and thermal pressure observed at ACE/Wind; the separation between STEREO B and ACE/Wind is about 0.06 AU, almost half of the MC radial width. For the first time, we reproduce observations at one spacecraft with data from another well-separated spacecraft, which provides compelling evidence for the flux-rope geometry and is of importance for understanding CME initiation and propagation. We also discuss the global configuration of the MC at different spacecraft on the basis of the reconstruction results., We calculate the structure and neutron content of neutrino-heated magnetohydrodynamic winds driven from the surface of newly formed magnetars (""protomagnetars"") and from the midplane of hyperaccreting disks, two of the possible central engines for GRBs and hyperenergetic SNe. Both the surface of protomagnetars and the midplane of neutrino-cooled accretion flows (NDAFs) are electron degenerate and neutron-rich (neutron-to-proton ratio n/p gg 1). If this substantial free neutron excess is preserved to large radii in ultrarelativistic outflows, several important observational consequences may result. Weak interaction processes, however, can drive n/p to ~1 in the nondegenerate regions that obtain just above the surfaces of NDAFs and protomagnetars. Our calculations show that mildly relativistic (Lorentz factor Γ lesssim 10) neutron-rich outflows from NDAFs are possible in the presence of a strong poloidal magnetic field. However, neutron-rich winds possess a minimum mass-loss rate that likely precludes simultaneously neutron-rich and ultrarelativistic (Γ gtrsim 100) NDAF winds accompanying a substantial accretion power. In contrast, protomagnetars are capable of producing neutron-rich long-duration GRB outflows ~10-30 s following core bounce for submillisecond rotation periods; such outflows would, however, accompany only extremely energetic events, in which the GRB+SN energy budget exceeds ~4 × 10<SUP>52</SUP> ergs. Neutron-rich highly relativistic outflows may also be produced during some short-duration GRBs by geometrically thick accretion disks formed from compact object mergers. The implications for r-process nucleosynthesis, optical transients due to nonrelativistic neutron-rich winds, and nickel production in protomagnetar and NDAF winds are also briefly discussed., In low-collisionality plasmas heat flows almost exclusively along magnetic field lines and the condition for stability to convection is modified from the standard Schwarzschild criterion. We present local two- and three-dimensional simulations of a new heat-flux-driven buoyancy instability (the HBI) that occurs when the temperature in a plasma decreases in the direction of gravity. We find that the HBI drives a convective dynamo that amplifies an initially weak magnetic field by a factor of ~20. In simulations that begin with the magnetic field aligned with the temperature gradient, the HBI saturates by rearranging the magnetic field lines to be almost purely perpendicular to the initial temperature gradient. This magnetic field reorientation results in a net heat flux through the plasma that is less than 1% of the field-free (Spitzer) value. We show that the HBI is likely to be present in the cool cores of clusters of galaxies between ~0.1-100 kpc, where the temperature increases outward. The saturated state of the HBI suggests that inward thermal conduction from large radii in clusters is unlikely to solve the cooling flow problem. Finally, we also suggest that the HBI may contribute to suppressing conduction across cold fronts in galaxy clusters., We report the discovery of a light echo (LE) from the Type Ia supernova (SN) 2006X in the nearby galaxy M100. The presence of the LE is supported by analysis of both the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) images and the Keck optical spectrum that we obtained at ~300 days after maximum brightness. In the image procedure, both the radial-profile analysis and the point-spread function (PSF) subtraction method resolve significant excess emission at 2-5 ACS pixels (~0.05''-0.13'') from the center. In particular, the PSF-subtracted ACS images distinctly appear to have an extended, ringlike echo. Due to limitations of the image resolution, we cannot confirm any structure or flux within 2 ACS pixels from the SN. The late-time spectrum of SN 2006X can be reasonably fit with two components: a nebular spectrum of a normal SN Ia and a synthetic LE spectrum. Both image and spectral analysis show a rather blue color for the emission of the LE, suggestive of a small average grain size for the scattering dust. Using the Cepheid distance to M100 of 15.2 Mpc, we find that the dust illuminated by the resolved LE is ~27-170 pc from the SN. The echo inferred from the nebular spectrum appears to be more luminous than that resolved in the images (at the ~2 σ level), perhaps suggesting the presence of an inner echo at &lt;2 ACS pixels (~0.05''). It is not clear, however, whether this possible local echo was produced by a distinct dust component (i.e., the local circumstellar dust) or by a continuous, larger distribution of dust as with the outer component. Nevertheless, our detection of a significant echo in SN 2006X confirms that this supernova was produced in a dusty environment having small dust particles., The Lunar Prospector Electron Reflectometer has obtained the first global map of lunar crustal magnetic fields, revealing that the effects of basin-forming impacts dominate the large-scale distribution of remanent magnetic fields on the Moon. The weakest surface magnetic fields (&lt;0.2 nT) are found within two of the largest and most recent impact basins, Orientale and Imbrium. Conversely, the largest concentrations of strong surface fields (&gt;40 nT) are diametrically opposite to these same basins. This pattern is present though less pronounced for several other post-Nectarian impact basins larger than 500 km in diameter. The reduced strength and clarity of the pattern for older basins may be attributed to: (1) demagnetization from many smaller impacts, which erases antipodal magnetic signatures over time, (2) superposition effects from other large impacts, and (3) variation in the strength of the ambient magnetizing field. The absence of fringing fields stronger than 1 nT around the perimeter of the Imbrium basin or associated with craters within the basin implies that any uniform magnetization of the impact melt must be weaker than ∼10 G cm <SUP>3</SUP> g <SUP>-1</SUP>. This limits the strength of any steady ambient magnetic field to no more than ∼0.1 Oe at the lunar surface while the basin cooled for tens of millions of years following the Imbrium impact 3.8 billion years ago., Evidence is growing for a class of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) characterized by an initial ~0.1-1 s spike of hard radiation followed, after a ~3-10 s lull in emission, by a softer period of extended emission lasting ~10-100 s. In a few well-studied cases, these `short GRBs with extended emission' show no evidence for a bright associated supernova (SN). We propose that these events are produced by the formation and early evolution of a highly magnetized, rapidly rotating neutron star (a `protomagnetar') which is formed from the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a white dwarf (WD), the merger and collapse of a WD-WD binary or perhaps, the merger of a double neutron star binary. The initial emission spike is powered by accretion on to the protomagnetar from a small disc that is formed during the AIC or merger event. The extended emission is produced by a relativistic wind that extracts the rotational energy of the protomagnetar on a time-scale ~10-100 s. The ~10 s delay between the prompt and extended emission is the time required for the newly formed protomagnetar to cool sufficiently that the neutrino-heated wind from its surface becomes ultrarelativistic. Because a protomagnetar ejects little or no<SUP>56</SUP>Ni (&lt; 10<SUP>-3</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB>), these events should not produce a bright SN-like transient. We model the extended emission from GRB060614 using spin-down calculations of a cooling protomagnetar, finding reasonable agreement with observations for a magnetar with an initial rotation period of ~1 ms and a surface dipole field of ~3 × 10<SUP>15</SUP> G. If GRBs are indeed produced by AIC or WD-WD mergers, they should occur within a mixture of both early- and late-type galaxies and should not produce strong gravitational wave emission. An additional consequence of our model is the existence of X-ray flashes unaccompanied by a bright SN and not associated with massive star formation., We present three-dimensional nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the interiors of fully convective M dwarfs. Our models consider 0.3 solar-mass stars using the Anelastic Spherical Harmonic code, with the spherical computational domain extending from 0.08 to 0.96 times the overall stellar radius. Like previous authors, we find that fully convective stars can generate kG-strength magnetic fields (in rough equipartition with the convective flows) without the aid of a tachocline of shear. Although our model stars are everywhere unstably stratified, the amplitudes and typical pattern sizes of the convective flows vary strongly with radius, with the outer regions of the stars hosting vigorous convection and field amplification while the deep interiors are more quiescent. Modest differential rotation is established in hydrodynamic calculations, but—unlike in some prior work—strongly quenched in MHD simulations because of the Maxwell stresses exerted by the dynamo-generated magnetic fields. Despite the lack of strong differential rotation, the magnetic fields realized in the simulations possess significant mean (axisymmetric) components, which we attribute partly to the strong influence of rotation on the slowly overturning flows., The IMPACT (In situ Measurements of Particles And CME Transients) investigation on the STEREO mission was designed and developed to provide multipoint solar wind and suprathermal electron, interplanetary magnetic field, and solar energetic particle information required to unravel the nature of coronal mass ejections and their heliospheric consequences. IMPACT consists of seven individual sensors which are packaged into a boom suite, and a SEP suite. This review summarizes the science objectives of IMPACT, the instruments that comprise the IMPACT investigation, the accommodation of IMPACT on the STEREO twin spacecraft, and the overall data products that will flow from the IMPACT measurements. Accompanying papers in this volume of Space Science Reviews highlight the individual sensor technical details and capabilities, STEREO project plans for the use of IMPACT data, and modeling activities for IMPACT (and other STEREO) data interpretation., We present the first statistical analysis of the thermal and nonthermal X-ray emission of all 25,705 microflares (RHESSI) observed between 2002 March and 2007 March. These events were found by searching the 6-12 keV energy range (see Paper I) and are small active region flares, from low (GOES) C class to below A class. Each microflare is automatically analyzed at the peak time of the 6-12 keV emission: the thermal source size is found by forward-fitting the complex visibilities for 4-8 keV, and the spectral parameters (temperature, emission measure, power-law index) are found by forward-fitting a thermal plus nonthermal model. The resulting wealth of information we determine about the events allows a range of the thermal and nonthermal properties to be investigated. In particular, we find that there is no correlation between the thermal loop size and the flare magnitude, indicating that microflares are not necessarily spatially small. We present the first thermal energy distribution of RHESSI flares and compare it to previous thermal energy distributions of transient events. We also present the first nonthermal power distribution of RHESSI flares and find that a few microflares have unexpectedly large nonthermal powers up to 10<SUP>28</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The total microflare nonthermal energy, however, is still small compared to that of large flares as it occurs for shorter durations. These large energies and difficulties in analyzing the steep nonthermal spectra suggest that a sharp broken power law and thick-target bremsstrahlung model may not be appropriate for microflares., We study atomic-line diagnostics of the inner regions of protoplanetary disks with our model of X-ray-irradiated disk atmospheres, which was previously used to predict observable levels of the Ne II and Ne III fine-structure transitions at 12.81 and 15.55 μm. We extend the X-ray ionization theory to sulfur and calculate the fraction of sulfur in S, S<SUP>+</SUP>, S<SUP>2 +</SUP>, and sulfur molecules. For the D'Alessio generic T Tauri star disk, we find that the S I fine-structure line at 25.55 μm is below the detection level of the Spitzer Infrared Spectrometer (IRS), in large part due to X-ray ionization of atomic S at the top of the atmosphere and to its incorporation into molecules close to the midplane. We predict that observable fluxes of the S II λ6718/λ6732 forbidden transitions are produced in the upper atmosphere at somewhat shallower depths and smaller radii than the neon fine-structure lines. This and other forbidden-line transitions, such as the O I λ6300/λ6363 and C I λ9826/λ9852 lines, serve as complementary diagnostics of X-ray-irradiated disk atmospheres. We have also analyzed the potential role of the low-excitation fine-structure lines of C I, C II, and O I, which should be observable by SOFIA and Herschel., The need for reliable and accurate photometric supernovae light curves has increased recently with the proposal of several wide-field imaging surveys. Through photometric measurements, the type and the redshift of the supernova can be determined. In order to ensure an accurate and reliable determination of redshifts through photometric data, a full study of the possible errors introduced through this method is needed. <P />SNAP, the Supernova Acceleration Probe, is a proposed space-based telescope that will perform a wild-field imaging survey to collect supernova light curves. The redshift of these supernovae must also be determined in order to make them useful as cosmological probes. Using the SNAP simulation code, redshift errors are considered and the effects upon the calculated cosmology can be analyzed. The simulation begins by creating many different supernova of varying redshifts. For each supernova, light curves are measured and a measured redshift is assigned from a Gaussian distribution with a predetermined standard deviation. The new redshift is the used to calculate supernova distance moduli and several cosmological parameters. By varying the standard deviation on the redshift error distributions the effects can be in the final cosmology. Understanding the correlation between redshift error and the final cosmology allows projects to set redshift measurement requirements., As part of an effort to understand the origin of open clusters, we present the results from a statistical analysis of the currently observed Pleiades. Starting with a photometric catalog of the group, we employed a maximum likelihood technique to determine the mass distribution of the cluster members, including single stars and both components of the binary systems. We find that the overall binary fraction for unresolved pairs is 68%. Extrapolating to include resolved systems, this fraction climbs to about 76%, significantly higher than the accepted field-star result. The primary and secondary masses are found to be correlated, in the sense that their ratios are closer to unity than under the hypothesis of random pairing. We also mapped out the spatial variation of the cluster's projected and three-dimensional mass and number densities. We find unambiguous evidence of mass segregation, and introduce a new method for quantifying the degree of segregation., The Nuclear Compton Telescope (NCT) is a balloon-borne soft gamma-ray (0.2 MeV to 10 MeV) germanium Compton telescope designed to study astrophysical sources of nuclear line emission and polarization. A prototype instrument was successfully launched from Ft. Sumner, NM on June 1, 2005. The NCT prototype consists of two 3D position-sensitive high purity germanium strip detectors fabricated with amorphous germanium contacts. The compact design and new technologies allow NCT to achieve high efficiencies with excellent spectral resolution and background reduction. Here we present a detailed study of approximately 8 hours of background measurements made from 580 g/cm<SUP>2</SUP> (4.6 km) to an average float altitude of 3.0 g/cm<SUP>2</SUP> (40 km), with particular emphasis on float observations. A total of 6 hr 9 min of observation time was acquired at float, while the duration of the ascent portion of the flight included in this study was 1 hr 50 min. The expected contributions to the background are discussed, especially in light of detailed Monte Carlo simulations modeling the entire flight and incorporating complete depth dependent environmental inputs, including 4 cosmic components (protons, photons, electrons, and positrons) and 8 atmospheric components (photons, atmospheric 511 keV emission, neutrons, protons, electrons, positrons, and muons). All components contribute a prompt signal. The protons and neutrons also contribute an activation-induced, or delayed, signal due to deexcitation of atomic nuclei and/or nuclear decay. Here we present results from our investigations, including the component makeup of the total background as a function of atmospheric depth, the contribution of delayed emission from passive material to the observed background, and the impact of these components on instrument sensitivity. The results presented here are relevant to future flights (see J.-L. Chiu, this conference) scheduled for launch from Ft. Sumner, NM in September 2008 (10 detectors) and Australia in December 2009 (12 detectors)., I review current status of force-free pulsar magnetosphere models. I consider in detail properties of force-free magnetosphere of an aligned pulsar and their implications for self-consistent models of real pulsars. I show that configuration of a pulsar magnetosphere may be very different from the ""canonical"" Goldreich-Julian model. I address problems with the current polar cap models which are incompatible with the force-free magnetosphere., Evidence is growing for a class of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) characterized by an initial spike hard radiation followed, after a 3-10 s lull in emission, by a softer period of extended emission lasting 10-100 s. These ""short GRBs with extended emission"" (SGRBEEs) show no evidence for an associated supernova (SN) and, in conflict with compact object merger models, appear to originate exclusively inside the disk of their host galaxies. We argue that SGRBEEs may instead be produced by the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a white dwarf (WD) or the merger and collapse of a WD-WD binary, perhaps thus sharing a close relation to the progenitors of Type Ia SNe. In this model, the initial spike of emission is powered by accretion onto the newly-formed proto-neutron star (PNS) from a small disk that is formed in the AIC or merger event. If the PNS is strongly magnetized (a ""proto-magnetar""), the extended emission may be produced by a relativistic wind that extracts the PNS's rotational energy on a timescale 10-100 s. We have modeled the extended emission from GRB060614 using spin-down calculations of a cooling proto-magnetar, finding reasonable agreement with observations for a magnetar with a surface field strength B 3e15 G and initial rotation period 1 ms. The 3-10 s delay between the prompt and extended emission is naturally explained by this model as the time required for the proto-magnetar to cool sufficiently that its outflow becomes ultra-relativistic. In the case of WD-WD mergers, extended emission may also be produced by accretion of the disk formed during the merger prior to collapse. We discuss ways to test the AIC/WD-WD merger model for SGRBEEs and to distinguish spin-down and accretion-powered extended emission via late-time radio observations and by searching for off-axis events, which may appear as X-ray flashes with no associated SN., We present results of optical follow-up observations of ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) candidates. A published ROSAT catalog of 87 ULX candidates named 19 of these as having optical counterparts in Digitized Sky Survey (DSS) images. Using Keck optical spectroscopy, we classify 16 ULX candidates in this subset as well as one other ULX candidate from the catalog with a counterpart in the DSS. This is one of the largest sets of optical identifications of such objects thus far. Fifteen are background active galactic nuclei (AGNs); two are foreground stars in our Galaxy. These findings are consistent with background and foreground object expectations, as derived from log N - log S relations. The logarithmic X-ray to optical flux ratios of these objects are also typical of background and foreground objects. Finally, we discuss the nature of ULX candidates outside the optical extent of their apparent host galaxies., IC 10 X-1 is a variable X-ray source in the Local Group starburst galaxy IC 10 whose optical counterpart is a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star. Prestwich et al. (2007, ApJ, 669, 21) recently proposed that it contains the most massive known stellar-mass black hole (24-33 solar masses), but their conclusion was based on radial velocities derived from only a few optical spectra, the most important of which was seriously affected by a CCD defect. Here we present new spectra of the WR star, spanning 5 nights, obtained with the Keck-I 10 m telescope (+LRIS). The spectra show a periodic shift in the He II emission line as compared with IC 10 nebular lines such as [O III] λ5007. From the measured centroids we derive the radial velocity of the WR star at each of our epochs. After performing a nonlinear least-squares fit to our velocity curve, we calculate a period of 35.6±0.305 hours (consistent with the X-ray period of 34.40±0.83 hours reported by Prestwich et al.) and a radial velocity semi-amplitude of 364䔸 km/s. The resulting mass function is 7.41±1.25 solar masses, consistent with that of Prestwich et al. (7.8). This, combined with the previously estimated (from spectra) mass of 35 solar masses for the WR star and assuming an edge-on system, yields a minimum primary mass of 32.2±2.66 solar masses. Even if the WR star has only 17 solar masses, the minimum primary mass is 22.7±2.05 solar masses. Thus, IC 10 X-1 is indeed a WR/black-hole binary containing the most massive known stellar-mass black hole. We acknowledge NSF grant AST-0607485 for support., High-precision radial velocity planet searches have surveyed over ~2000 nearby stars and detected over ~200 planets. While these same stars likely harbor many additional planets, they will become increasingly challenging to detect, as they tend to have relatively small masses and/or relatively long orbital periods. Therefore, observers are increasing the precision of their observations, continuing to monitor stars over decade timescales, and also preparing to survey thousands more stars. Given the considerable amounts of telescope time required for such observing programs, it is important to use the available resources as efficiently as possible. Previous studies have found that a wide range of predetermined scheduling algorithms results in planet searches with similar sensitivities. We have developed adaptive scheduling algorithms which have a solid basis in Bayesian inference and information theory and also are computationally feasible for modern planet searches. We have performed Monte Carlo simulations of plausible planet searches to test the power of adaptive scheduling algorithms. Our simulations demonstrate that planet searches performed with adaptive scheduling algorithms can simultaneously detect more planets, detect less massive planets, and measure orbital parameters more accurately than comparable surveys using a non-adaptive scheduling algorithm. We expect that these techniques will be particularly valuable for the N2K radial velocity planet search for short-period planets as well as future astrometric planet searches with the Space Interferometry Mission, which aim to detect terrestrial-mass planets., Temporal sampling does more than add another axis to the vector of observables. Instead, under the recognition that how objects change (and move) in time speaks directly to the physics underlying astronomical phenomena, next-generation wide-field synoptic surveys are poised to revolutionize our understanding of just about anything that goes bump in the night (which is just about everything at some level). Still, even the most ambitious surveys will require targeted spectroscopic follow-up to fill in the physical details of newly discovered transients. We are now building a new system intended to ingest and classify transient phenomena in near real-time from high-throughput imaging data streams. Described herein, the Transient Classification Project at Berkeley will be making use of classification techniques operating on ``features'' extracted from time series and contextual (static) information. We also highlight the need for a community adoption of a standard representation of astronomical time series data (ie. ``VOTimeseries'')., This Resource Letter provides a guide to the literature on dark energy and the accelerating universe. It is intended to be of use to researchers, teachers, and students at several levels. Journal articles, books, and websites are cited for the following topics: Einstein's cosmological constant, quintessence or dynamical scalar fields, modified cosmic gravity, relations to high-energy physics, cosmological probes and observations, terrestrial probes, calculational tools and parameter estimation, teaching strategies and educational resources, and the fate of the universe., SN 2006gy radiated far more energy in visual light than any other supernova so far, and potential explanations for its energy demands have implications for galactic chemical evolution and the deaths of the first stars. It remained bright for over 200 days, longer than any normal supernova, and it radiated more than 10<SUP>51</SUP> ergs of luminous energy at visual wavelengths. I argue that this Type IIn supernova was probably the explosion of an extremely massive star like Eta Carinae that retained its hydrogen envelope when it exploded, having suffered relatively little mass loss during its lifetime. That this occurred at roughly Solar metallicity challenges current paradigms for mass loss in massive-star evolution. I explore a few potential explanations for SN2006gy's power source, involving either circumstellar interaction, or instead, the decay of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni to <SUP>56</SUP>Co to <SUP>56</SUP>Fe. If SN 2006gy was powered by the conversion of shock energy into light, then the conditions must be truly extraordinary and traditional interaction models don't work. If SN 2006gy was powered by radioactive decay, then the uncomfortably huge <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass requires that the star exploded as a pair instability supernova. The mere possibility of this makes SN 2006gy interesting, especially at this meeting, because it is the first good candidate for a genuine pair instability supernova., Gravitational wave standard sirens have been considered as precision distance indicators of high redshift; however, at high redshift standard sirens or standard candles such as supernovae suffer from lensing noise. We investigate lensing noise as a signal instead and show how measurements of the maximum demagnification (minimum convergence) probe cosmology in a manner highly complementary to the distance itself. Revisiting the original form for minimum convergence we quantify the bias arising from the commonly used approximation. Furthermore, after presenting a new lensing probability function we discuss how the width of the lensed standard siren amplitude distribution also probes growth of structure. Thus standard sirens and candles can serve as triple probes of dark energy, measuring both the cosmic expansion history and growth history., Gravitational instability of a vertically thin, dusty sheet near the midplane of a protoplanetary disk has long been proposed as a way of forming planetesimals. Before Roche densities can be achieved, however, the dust-rich layer, sandwiched from above and below by more slowly rotating dust-poor gas, threatens to overturn and mix by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI). Whether such a threat is real has never been demonstrated: the Richardson criterion for the KHI is derived for two-dimensional Cartesian shear flow and does not account for rotational forces. Here we present three-dimensional numerical simulations of gas-dust mixtures in a shearing box, accounting for the full suite of disk-related forces: the Coriolis and centrifugal forces, and radial tidal gravity. Dust particles are assumed small enough to be perfectly entrained in gas; the two fluids share the same velocity field but obey separate continuity equations. We find that the Richardson number Ri does not alone determine stability. The critical value of Ri below which the dust layer overturns and mixes depends on the height-integrated metallicity Σ<SUB>d</SUB>/Σ<SUB>g</SUB> (surface density ratio of dust to gas). Nevertheless, for Σ<SUB>d</SUB>/Σ<SUB>g</SUB> between 1 and 5 times solar, the critical Ri maintains a nearly constant value of ~0.1. Keplerian radial shear stabilizes those modes that would otherwise disrupt the layer at large Ri. If the height-integrated metallicity is at least ~5 times greater than the solar value of 0.01, then midplane dust densities can approach Roche densities. Such a metal-rich environment might be expected to produce gas giant planets having similarly supersolar metallicities., The impulsive phase of a solar flare marks the epoch of rapid conversion of energy stored in the preflare coronal magnetic field. Hard X-ray observations imply that a substantial fraction of flare energy released during the impulsive phase is converted to the kinetic energy of mildly relativistic electrons (10-100 keV). The liberation of the magnetic free energy can occur as the coronal magnetic field reconfigures and relaxes following reconnection. We investigate a scenario in which products of the reconfiguration—large-scale Alfvén wave pulses—transport the energy and the magnetic field changes rapidly through the corona to the lower atmosphere. This offers two possibilities for electron acceleration. First, in a coronal plasma with β &lt; m<SUB>e</SUB>/m<SUB>p</SUB>, the waves propagate as inertial Alfvén waves. In the presence of strong spatial gradients, these generate field-aligned electric fields that can accelerate electrons to energies on the order of 10 keV and above, including by repeated interactions between electrons and wave fronts. Second, when they reflect and mode-convert in the chromosphere, a cascade to high wavenumbers may develop. This will also accelerate electrons by turbulence, in a medium with a locally high electron number density. This concept, which bridges MHD-based and particle-based views of a flare, provides an interpretation of the recently observed rapid variations of the line-of-sight component of the photospheric magnetic field across the flare impulsive phase, and offers solutions to some perplexing flare problems, such as the flare ""number problem"" of finding and resupplying sufficient electrons to explain the impulsive-phase hard X-ray emission., We present extensive optical (UBVRI), near-infrared (JK) light curves and optical spectroscopy of the Type Ia supernova SN 2006X in the nearby galaxy NGC 4321 (M100). Our observations suggest that either SN 2006X has an intrinsically peculiar color evolution or it is highly reddened [E(B - V)<SUB>host</SUB> = 1.42 +/- 0.04 mag ] with R<SUB>V</SUB> = 1.48 +/- 0.06, much lower than the canonical value of 3.1 for the average Galactic dust. SN 2006X also has one of the highest expansion velocities ever published for an SN Ia. Compared with the other SNe Ia we analyzed, SN 2006X has a broader light curve in the U band, a more prominent bump/shoulder feature in the V and R bands, a more pronounced secondary maximum in the I and NIR bands, and a remarkably smaller late-time decline rate in the B band. The B - V color evolution shows an obvious deviation from the Lira-Phillips relation at 1-3 months after maximum brightness. At early times, optical spectra of SN 2006X displayed strong, high-velocity features of both intermediate-mass elements (Si, Ca, and S) and iron peak elements, while at late times they showed a relatively blue continuum, consistent with the blue U - B and B - V colors at similar epochs. A light echo and/or the interaction of the SN ejecta and its circumstellar material may provide a plausible explanation for its late-time photometric and spectroscopic behavior. Using the Cepheid distance of M100, we derive a Hubble constant of 72.8 +/- 8.2 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> (statistical) from the normalized dereddened luminosity of SN 2006X. We briefly discuss whether abnormal dust is a universal signature for all SNe Ia and whether the most rapidly expanding objects form a subclass with distinct photometric and spectroscopic properties., We have conducted a deep ((mu)_g ≲ 24) imaging survey using the WIYN 4-m telescope, the UH 88-inch telescope, and the 2.5m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) to search for giant arcs behind the richest clusters identified in the Gpc^3 cosmological volume of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By imaging over 200 massive clusters this ongoing survey has uncovered some of the most dramatic examples of gravitational lensing ever discovered. Similar to `poster-child' lenses like Abell 1689 and CL0024+1654, these new lensing systems exhibit multiple bright arcs at large angular separations. We propose to use GMOS on Gemini-North to determine the redshifts of 30 arcs behind our 10 most dramatic lenses. When combined with the Einstein radii of the arcs, these redshifts will pinpoint the mass and distribution of the dark matter on (comoving) scales R &lt; 200hkpc. The larger scale (R 1-5hMpc) weak gravitational lensing shear has been measured for four of our cluster targets in an ongoing deep wide-field multicolor imaging program at Subaru. The synthesis of GMOS arc redshifts with weak and strong lensing will allow us to measure the shape and density profile of the dark matter on (comoving) scales 200hkpc &lt; R &lt; 5hMpc for a statistical sample of lensing clusters, providing a powerful test of the (Lambda)CDM paradigm., We propose to use NIRI to measure the depth and shape of the 3(micron) water ice absorption feature in three edge-on disks in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud. This will provide us with an estimate of the total column density of ice in these disks and an indication of the thermal processing it has experienced. In protoplanetary disks, water ice coats dust grains in the majority of the disk volume and plays a major role in favoring grain-grain sticking during collisions, a key phenomenon towards the formation of planetesimals. In edge-on disks, the disk near- infrared thermal radiation, arising from the innermost regions, provides a continuous background that can be absorbed by water ice in the cold outer regions of the disks. These systems therefore offer a unique opportunity to probe water ice in protoplanetary disks. The proposed observations will double the number of edge-on disks with detected water ice absorption and represent the first such observations in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud., The Swift satellite has revolutionized the study of gamma-ray bursts by providing unprecedented numbers of accurate real-time localizations. With rapid and now automated access to GMOS-S, Gemini has emerged as the cornerstone facility of our group's GRB research efforts. A pressing question -- which we hope to address with a systematic imaging study with Gemini -- is the origin of so-called dark afterglow GRBs, which comprise roughly half the existing sample. Constraining, in particular, the number of dark GRBs at moderate-to-high redshift has important implications for understanding the bursts themselves as well as informing the role of future missions (eg. JDEM, LSST). In general, GRB afterglows have proven to be a versatile and unique astrophysical probe in the study of the ISM of distant galaxies, the IGM at z&gt;2, and into the end of the reionization epoch. To this end, our proposed semester 2008A ToO program also seeks to uncover a number of damped-Lyman alpha systems as well as improve the (very curious) statistics of strong intervening Mg II absorbers towards GRB sitelines., The recent detection of a Neptune-mass exoplanet candidate around the low-mass star GJ 176 is an important and exciting discovery in the field of extrasolar planets (Endl et al 2007). While Jupiter mass companions to low mass stars appear to be rare, several Neptune sized objects have been found around M dwarfs. This suggests that companion mass may scale with primary mass, an intriguing result for modeling planet formation. Further, five of the six M dwarfs known to have planetary companions have more than one. Refining the orbit of GJ 176b will help determine if this star, too, hosts a multiple-planet system. However, the discovery data are scattered over 4 years and lack periods of high observing cadence resulting in ambiguities when interpreting the results. The measurement windowing function introduces aliasing which prevents unique determination of the companion's orbital period. A more conclusive evaluation of the nature of the companion will be enabled by high-cadence observations, which avoid aliasing issues by providing a more continuous windowing function over several companion orbits. We propose to monitor GJ 176 for 21 consecutive nights to cover 2 full orbits of the companion to GJ 176., Recent Spitzer observations have added to the list of young stellar objects thought to possess circumstellar disks with large gaps or inner holes. The favored explanation for these large clearings is that planets are forming (or have recently formed) in these disks, and are preventing inward accretion of outer disk material. While millimeter- wavelength imaging has confirmed the existence of large holes around a few objects, substantial uncertainties remain in understanding what is going on within the cleared regions. Imaging at mid-IR wavelengths can spatially resolve the inner edges of holes and gaps, and probe small dust within the cleared regions, potentially tracing structures associated with planets in formation. We propose to use TReCS at Gemini South to spatially resolve the mid-infrared emission from protoplanetary disks suspected of harboring massive planets, and thereby directly measure the sizes and degree of clearing of the inner holes and gaps. Using a custom short-readout mode for TReCS, and the novel imaging technique of speckle interferometry, we will spatially resolve the mid- IR emission from these potentially planet-forming systems., Our understanding of Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe), has greatly improved in the last years thanks to unprecedented high resolution images taken from the HUBBLE, CHANDRA and XMM satellites. The discovery of complex but similar inner features, with the presence of unexpected axisymmetric rings and jets, has prompted a new investigation into the dynamics of the interaction of the pulsar winds with the surrounding SNR, which, thanks to the improvement in the computational resources, has let to a better understanding of the properties of these objects. On the other hand the discovery of non-thermal emission from bow shock PWNe, and of systems with a complex interaction between pulsar and SNR, has led to the development of more reliable evolutionary models. I will review the standard theory of PWNe, their evolution, and the current status in the modeling of their emission properties, in particular I will show that our evolutionary models are able to describe the observations, and that the X-ray emission can now be reproduced with sufficient accuracy, to the point that we can use these nebulae to investigate fundamental issues as the properties of relativistic outflows and particle acceleration., Dark energy is the name given to the unknown physics causing the current acceleration of the cosmic expansion. Whether dark energy is truly a new component of energy density or an extension of gravitational physics beyond general relativity is not yet known. <P />From: Mattia Galiazzo Address: mattia.galiazzo@univie.ac.at Database: ast, I calculate the linear stability of a stratified low-collisionality plasma in the presence of a weak magnetic field. Heat is assumed to flow only along magnetic field lines. In the absence of a heat flux in the background plasma, Balbus demonstrated that plasmas in which the temperature increases in the direction of gravity are buoyantly unstable to convective-like motions (the ""magnetothermal instability""). I show that in the presence of a background heat flux, an analogous instability is present when the temperature decreases in the direction of gravity. The instability is driven by the background heat flux, and the fastest growing mode has a growth time of order the local dynamical time. Thus, independent of the sign of the temperature gradient, weakly magnetized low-collisionality plasmas are unstable on a dynamical time to magnetically mediated buoyancy instabilities. The instability described in this paper is predicted to be present in clusters of galaxies at radii ~0.1-100 kpc, where the observed temperature increases outward. Possible consequences for the origin of cluster magnetic fields, ""cooling flows,"" and the thermodynamics of the intercluster medium are briefly discussed., With the current science comissioning of the Allen Telescope Array, we have the first opportunity to conduct a wide-field radio transient survey with real-time detection and significant limiting fluxes. The FiGSS survey on the ATA will detect 1-1000 radio transients in semester 2008A. Optical/NIR follow-up of these sources is critical for understanding their nature. Early surveys indicate that many of the transients discovered by FiGSS may be low mass flare stars and supernovae but many transients cannot be easily identified with known phenomena. Photometry will show associations with stellar or galactic objects and spectroscopy will help identify the objects and determine the redshifts of the transients. We request follow-up of 12 transients, which will overcome Poisson statistics in rate calculations and is a reasonable estimate of the number of transients to be discovered by the ATA in 2008A. This survey (with optical/NIR follow-up as part of a larger multi-wavelength follow-up program) is a precursor to other transient surveys conducted with future radio arrays such as the MWA, LOFAR, and SKA., Circumstellar disks are the birthplace of planets, in which sub-micron dust grains gradually assemble into larger bodies. Spatially resolved, multiwavelength imaging of such disks has proven very successful for studying their properties, and has provided insight into processes of disk evolution and grain growth around many T Tauri and Herbig Ae stars. Results to date suggest that disk properties do vary somewhat between these two classes of stars, consistent with the recent discovery that planetary orbits around A-type stars differ significantly from those typical around solar-type stars. Detailed investigations of disks across a wide range of masses will help to determine the physical mechanism(s) behind these differences. But resolved images of disks remain very rare for stars intermediate between T Tauri and Herbig Ae (the so-called Herbig Fe stars). We therefore propose to obtain high resolution, spatially resolved images of two newly-identified disks around nearby Fe stars, using NIRI and Michelle on Gemini. These data will double the number of Fe stars with resolved protoplanetary disks and thereby contribute key data for understanding the transition between the differing disk geometries of T Tauri and Herbig Ae stars., Zircons in silicic magmas begin to crystallize 10's to 100's of thousands of years (ka) prior to their eruption. U/Pb and U/Th dating for zircons from 32 young extrusions indicate a range of mean pre-eruption ages from ∼ 33 to 247 ka, with a median of 92 ka. Explosive large volume (widespread) eruptions show a narrower range and a younger median of 70 ka. These results indicate that the difference between initial zircon growth and eruption age measured by other (e.g., <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar) techniques is in excess of the achievable analytical uncertainty for eruptions &lt; 30 million years (Ma), and likely for eruptions of up to 300 Ma. Protracted pre-eruption zircon growth is well established by an increasing number of studies on magma process time scales, but this source of eruption age bias has been largely ignored in chronostratigraphic applications of high-precision U/Pb data. Until intrinsic properties of zircons or their host deposits enable a priori estimates of pre-eruption age bias, it is prudent to expand the uncertainties attending all U/Pb zircon ages interpreted as deposition ages (in e.g., chronostratigraphic studies) by + 0/- 200 ka., We present details of the design of a micro-channel based photon counting image-tube developed for ground-based visible astronomical observations with a timing precision &lt;1 micro-sec. The image-tube, developed at UC Berkeley, was subsequently attached to the prime focus of the 40 inch Nickel telescope at the Lick Observatory to obtain high time resolution photometric data on a variety of objects that included the Crab pulsar, cataclysmic variable stars (BG CMi, SU UMa) and dMe-type flare stars (FL Vir and V1054 Oph). We report on preliminary scientific results from these data and outline some of the specialized observational techniques required to successfully carry out observations with such detector systems at high time resolution. Further developments of the detector system to enhance its performance are underway and will be described, as well as other potential applications such as high time resolution polarimetry., Quintessence theories for cosmic acceleration imbue dark energy with a non-trivial dynamics that offers hope in distinguishing the physical origin of this component. We review quintessence models with an emphasis on the dynamics and discuss classifications of the different physical behaviors. The pros and cons of various parameterizations are examined as well as the extension from scalar fields to other modifications of the Friedmann expansion equation. New results on the ability of cosmological data to distinguish among and between thawing and freezing fields are presented., Every 5.5 years, η Carinae experiences a dramatic ``spectroscopic event'' when high-excitation lines in its UV, optical, and IR spectrum disappear, and its hard X-ray and radio continuum flux crash. This periodicity has been attributed to an eccentric binary system with a shell ejection occurring at periastron, and the next periastron event will occur at the very end of 2008. In addition, η Car shows long term changes as it is still recovering from its giant 19th century outburst. Both types of variability are directly linked to the current mass-loss rate and dust formation in its wind. Mid-IR images and spectra with T-ReCS provide a direct measure of changes in the current bolometric luminosity and a direct measure of the massw in dust formation episodes that may occur at periastron in the colliding wind shock. Near-IR emission lines trace related changes in the post-event wind and ionization changes in the circumstellar environment needed to test specific models for the cause of η Car's variability as it recovers from its recent ``event''. High resolution near-IR spectra with Phoenix will continue the important work of HST/STIS, investigating changes in the direct and reflected spectrum of the stellar wind, and ionization changes in the nebula., High-resolution hard X-ray observations provided by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) are used to study the spectral evolution of ~50-200 keV nonthermal electron bremsstrahlung emissions of five X-class flares observed during the January 2005 solar storm events. Four of these flares show progressive spectral hardening during at least some hard X-ray peaks, while only one event shows the otherwise more commonly observed soft-hard-soft behavior. Imaging observations reveal that ~50-100 keV nonthermal electron bremsstrahlung emissions originate from footpoints of flare loops at all times, including during times of progressive spectral hardening, indicating that the spectral hardening component is produced by precipitating electrons, and not by electrons trapped in the corona. The four flares with progressive spectral hardening are all related to solar energetic particle (SEP) events, while the only X-class flare with soft-hard-soft behavior is not. This finding is consistent with earlier studies, suggesting that electron acceleration and transport in flares is somehow linked to the production of SEPs escaping into interplanetary space., We present a complete set of diagnostic tools aimed at reproducing synthetic non-thermal (synchrotron and/or Inverse Compton, IC) emissivity, integrated flux energy, polarization and spectral index simulated maps in comparison to observations. The time dependent relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) equations are solved with a shock capturing code together with the evolution of the maximum particles energy. Applications to Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe) are shown., We present narrowband images of the Kepler supernova remnant obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. The images, with an angular resolution of 0.05'', reveal the structure of the emitting gas in unprecedented detail. Radiative and nonradiative shocks are found in close proximity, unresolvable in ground-based spectra, indicating that the pre-shock medium is highly clumped. The ionization structure, traced by differences in the [O III] to [N II] flux ratio, varies on subarcsecond scales. The variation is due to both differences in shock velocity and gradients in the evolutionary stage of the shocks. A prominent complex of knots protruding beyond the boundary of the remnant in the northwest is found to consist of bright radiative knots, connected by arcuate nonradiative filaments. Based on the coincidence of the optical emission with a bright isolated knot of X-ray emission, we infer that this feature is due to a Rayleigh-Taylor finger that formed at the contact discontinuity and overtook the primary blastwave., The energy density of the vacuum, Λ, is at least 60 orders of magnitude smaller than several known contributions to it. Approaches to this problem are tightly constrained by data ranging from elementary observations to precision experiments. Absent overwhelming evidence to the contrary, dark energy can only be interpreted as vacuum energy, so the venerable assumption that Λ = 0 conflicts with observation. The possibility remains that Λ is fundamentally variable, though constant over large spacetime regions. This can explain the observed value, but only in a theory satisfying a number of restrictive kinematic and dynamical conditions. String theory offers a concrete realization through its landscape of metastable vacua., I outline a mechanism, akin to Weibel instabilities of interpenetrating beams, in which the neighboring current sheets in a striped wind from an oblique rotator interact through a two stream-like mechanism (a Weibel instability in flatland), to create an anomalous resistivity that heats the sheets and causes the magnetic field to difffusively annihilate in the wind upstream of the termination shock. The heating has consequences for observable unpulsed emission from pulsars., I share a few reminiscences and observations of 40 years of Pulsars., We report on the first results of an imaging survey to detect strong gravitational lensing targeting the richest clusters selected from the photometric data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with follow-up deep imaging observations from the Wisconsin-Indiana-Yale NOAO (WIYN) 3.5 m telescope and the University of Hawaii 88 inch telescope (UH88). The clusters are selected from an area of 8000 deg<SUP>2</SUP> using the red cluster sequence technique and span the redshift range 0.1 lsim z lsim 0.6, corresponding to a comoving cosmological volume of ~2 Gpc<SUP>3</SUP>. Our imaging survey thus targets a volume more than an order of magnitude larger than any previous search. A total of 240 clusters were imaged of which 141 had sub-arcsecond image quality. Our survey has uncovered 16 new lensing clusters with definite giant arcs, an additional 12 systems for which the lensing interpretation is very likely, and 9 possible lenses which contain shorter arclets or candidate arcs which are less certain and will require further observations to confirm their lensing origin. Among these new systems are several of the most dramatic examples of strong gravitational lensing ever discovered, with multiple bright arcs at large angular separation. These will likely become ""poster-child"" gravitational lenses similar to Abell 1689 and CL0024+1654. The new lenses discovered in this survey will enable future systematic studies of the statistics of strong lensing and their implications for cosmology and our structure formation paradigm., Prior to the incineration of a white dwarf (WD) that makes a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), the star ""simmers"" for ~1000 yr in a convecting, carbon-burning region. We have found that weak interactions during this time increase the neutron excess by an amount that depends on the total quantity of carbon burned prior to the explosion. This contribution is in addition to the metallicity (Z) dependent neutronization through the <SUP>22</SUP>Ne abundance (as studied by Timmes, Brown, &amp; Truran). The main consequence is that we expect a ""floor"" to the level of neutronization that dominates over the metallicity contribution when Z/Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>lesssim 2/3, and it can be important for even larger metallicities if substantial energy is lost to neutrinos via the convective Urca process. This would mask any correlations between SN Ia properties and galactic environments at low metallicities. In addition, we show that recent observations of the dependences of SNe Ia on galactic environments make it clear that metallicity alone cannot provide for the full observed diversity of events., During accretion, a neutron star (NS) is spun up as angular momentum is transported through its liquid surface layers. We study the resulting differentially rotating profile, focusing on the impact this has for type I X-ray bursts. The viscous heating is found to be negligible, but turbulent mixing can be activated. Mixing has the greatest impact when the buoyancy at the compositional discontinuity between accreted matter and ashes is overcome. This occurs preferentially at high accretion rates or low spin frequencies and may depend on the ash composition from the previous burst. We then find two new regimes of burning. The first is ignition in a layer containing a mixture of heavier elements with recurrence times as short as ~5-30 minutes, similar to short recurrence time bursts. When mixing is sufficiently strong, a second regime is found where accreted helium mixes deep enough to burn stably, quenching X-ray bursts altogether. The carbon-rich material produced by stable helium burning would be important for triggering and fueling superbursts., Ongoing accretion onto galactic disks has been recently theorized to progress via the unstable cooling of the baryonic halo into condensed clouds. These clouds have been identified as analogous to the high-velocity clouds (HVCs) observed in H I in our Galaxy. Here we compare the distribution of HVCs observed around our own Galaxy and extraplanar gas around the Andromeda galaxy to these possible HVC analogs in a simulation of galaxy formation that naturally generates these condensed clouds. We find a very good correspondence between these observations and the simulation in terms of number, angular size, velocity distribution, overall flux, and flux distribution of the clouds. We show that condensed cloud accretion accounts for only ~0.2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> of the current overall Galactic accretion in the simulations. We also find that the simulated halo clouds accelerate and become more massive as they fall toward the disk. The parameter space of the simulated clouds is consistent with all of the observed HVC complexes that have distance constraints, except the Magellanic Stream, which is known to have a different origin. We also find that nearly half of these simulated halo clouds would be indistinguishable from lower velocity gas and that this effect is strongest farther from the disk of the galaxy, thus indicating a possible missing population of HVCs. These results indicate that the majority of HVCs are consistent with being infalling, condensed clouds that are a remnant of Galaxy formation., We measured Ca stable isotope ratios (δ <SUP>44/40</SUP>Ca) in an ancient (2 My), hyperarid soil where the primary source of mobile Ca is atmospheric deposition. Most of the Ca in the upper meter of this soil (3.5 kmol m <SUP>-2</SUP>) is present as sulfates (2.5 kmol m <SUP>-2</SUP>), and to a lesser extent carbonates (0.4 kmol m <SUP>-2</SUP>). In aqueous extracts of variably hydrated calcium sulfate minerals, δ <SUP>44/40</SUP>Ca <SUB>E</SUB> values (vs. bulk Earth) increase with depth (1.4 m) from a minimum of -1.91‰ to a maximum of +0.59‰. The trend in carbonate-δ <SUP>44/40</SUP>Ca in the top six horizons resembles that of sulfate-δ <SUP>44/40</SUP>Ca, but with values 0.1-0.6‰ higher. The range of observed Ca isotope values in this soil is about half that of δ <SUP>44/40</SUP>Ca values observed on Earth. Linear correlation among δ <SUP>44/40</SUP>Ca, δ <SUP>34</SUP>S and δ <SUP>18</SUP>O values indicates either (a) a simultaneous change in atmospheric input values for all three elements over time, or (b) isotopic fractionation of all three elements during downward transport. We present evidence that the latter is the primary cause of the isotopic variation that we observe. Sulfate-δ <SUP>34</SUP>S values are positively correlated with sulfate-δ <SUP>18</SUP>O values ( R<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.78) and negatively correlated with sulfate δ <SUP>44/40</SUP>Ca <SUB>E</SUB> values ( R<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.70). If constant fractionation and conservation of mass with downward transport are assumed, these relationships indicate a δ <SUP>44/40</SUP>Ca fractionation factor of -0.4‰ in CaSO <SUB>4</SUB>. The overall depth trend in Ca isotopes is reproduced by a model of isotopic fractionation during downward Ca transport that considers small and infrequent but regularly recurring rainfall events. Near surface low Ca isotope values are reproduced by a Rayleigh model derived from measured Ca concentrations and the Ca fractionation factor predicted by the relationship with S isotopes. This indicates that the primary mechanism of stable isotope fractionation in CaSO <SUB>4</SUB> is incremental and effectively irreversible removal of an isotopically enriched dissolved phase by downward transport during small rainfall events., We study the long term evolution of magnetic fields generated by an initially unmagnetized collisionless relativistic e<SUP>+</SUP>e<SUP>-</SUP> shock. Our two-dimensional particle-in-cell numerical simulations show that downstream of such a Weibel-mediated shock, particle distributions are approximately isotropic, relativistic Maxwellians, and the magnetic turbulence is highly intermittent spatially. The nonpropagating magnetic fields decay in amplitude and do not merge. The fields start with magnetic energy density ~ 0.1-0.2 of equipartition, but rapid downstream decay drives the fields to much smaller values, below ~10<SUP>-3</SUP> of equipartition after ~10<SUP>3</SUP> skin depths. To construct a theory to follow field decay to these smaller values, we hypothesize that the observed damping is a variant of Landau damping. The model is based on the small value of the downstream magnetic energy density, which only weakly perturbs particle orbits, for homogeneous turbulence. Using linear kinetic theory, we find a simple analytic form for the damping rates for small-amplitude, subluminous electromagnetic fields. Our theory predicts that overall magnetic energy decays as (ω<SUB>p</SUB>t)<SUP>-q</SUP> with q ~ 1, which compares with simulations. However, our theory predicts overly rapid damping of short-wavelength modes. Magnetic trapping of particles within the highly spatially intermittent downstream magnetic structures may be the origin of this discrepancy and may allow for some of this initial magnetic energy to persist. Absent additional physical processes that create longer wavelength, more persistent fields, we conclude that initially unmagnetized relativistic shocks in electron-positron plasmas are unable to form persistent downstream magnetic fields. These results put interesting constraints on synchrotron models for the prompt and afterglow emission from GRBs. We also comment on the relevance of these results for relativistic electron-ion shocks., This Letter presents the first ab initio, fully electromagnetic, kinetic simulations of magnetized turbulence in a homogeneous, weakly collisional plasma at the scale of the ion Larmor radius (ion gyroscale). Magnetic- and electric-field energy spectra show a break at the ion gyroscale; the spectral slopes are consistent with scaling predictions for critically balanced turbulence of Alfvén waves above the ion gyroscale (spectral index -5/3) and of kinetic Alfvén waves below the ion gyroscale (spectral indices of -7/3 for magnetic and -1/3 for electric fluctuations). This behavior is also qualitatively consistent with in situ measurements of turbulence in the solar wind. Our findings support the hypothesis that the frequencies of turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind remain well below the ion cyclotron frequency both above and below the ion gyroscale., Observations of solar flares partially occulted by the solar limb provide diagnostics of coronal hard X-ray (HXR) emissions in the absence of generally much brighter emissions from footpoints of flare loops. In this paper, a statistical survey of 55 partially occulted flares observed by the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) is presented, revealing the existence of two different components of coronal HXR emissions. Below ~15 keV thermal HXR emission with a gradual time profile is generally dominant, while at higher energies an additional component is seen in 50 out of 55 events. This additional component shows faster time variations in the order of tens of seconds and is most prominent during the rise of the thermal emission. A comparison of the centroid positions of these two emissions shows that they are most often cospatial within ~2000 km, although for a few events clear separations are observed as well. The spectra of the high-energy component show a rather steep (soft) power law with indices mostly between ~4 and ~6. Thin target emission in the corona from flare-accelerated electrons is discussed as a possible origin of the fast time variation component., After an introduction to the Standard Model of particle physics and the unresolved question of naturalness posed by its treatment of electroweak symmetry breaking, we consider several different theoretical approaches that attempt to answer this question. First, we present work in which we consider the possibility that the Higgs boson, the long-sought hypothetical particle intimately associated with electroweak symmetry breaking, has a much larger mass than is usually assumed. Absent direct experimental evidence for a light Higgs boson (m ∼ O (100 GeV)), and precision electroweak data consistent with a light Higgs notwithstanding, we propose a heavier (m ∼ O (500 GeV)), thus more natural, Higgs boson. This heavy Higgs can be made consistent with the precision electroweak data if we also extend the Standard Model via the inclusion of new fermionic states near the weak energy scale. These new states, in addition to bringing the heavy Higgs boson in line with the precision data, also serve as a candidate for the elusive dark matter that pervades the universe. From there we go on to consider the problem of naturalness from the perspective of supersymmetry, one of the most popular candidates for physics beyond the Standard Model. In particular, the theory of the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) has found favor in its ability to solve the problem of naturalness posed by the Standard Model, in its hints at unification of the strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions at high energies, and in its ability to provide supersymmetric particles as dark matter candidates. The NMSSM, however, requires rather large superpartner masses in order to accommodate a Higgs boson heavier than current experimental bounds while still maintaining gauge unification at high energies. We explore the possibility of new supersymmetric states at intermediate energies between the weak scale and the unification scale, which preserve gauge unification and allow a heavier Higgs, with only moderately heavy superpartners. Finally, we explore the possibility that previous attempts to resolve the naturalness problem may be too limited in scope. Perhaps the anthropic principle can instead provide a new way to answer such questions. We consider the intriguing scenario in which our observed universe is but one region of a much larger multi-verse, and the ""constants"" of nature are not constant after all, but take on a range of values. The anthropic principle's unique answer to the problem of naturalness is that only those regions of the multiverse with unnatural or ""fine-tuned"" parameters can give rise to the physical processes and structures that are necessary for our very existence; those regions with more natural values are dead universes where life is impossible. In particular, we examine an implementation of a unified physical theory, the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), within this multi-verse framework, and its consequences for the naturalness of electroweak symmetry breaking., The advent of extensive ground-based and space-based vector magnetogram data will greatly improve our quantitative understanding of how magnetic fields evolve in the solar atmosphere. A problem of great current interest is the derivation of electric fields or velocity fields from vector magnetogram data, as this is the crucial link between observation and future physicsbased time-dependent models of the solar atmosphere. Most previous techniques for deriving E or v have used only the normal component of the magnetic induction equation, as it is generally believed that depth derivatives contained in the magnetic induction equation cannot be derived from vector measurements taken within a single layer. We will show that in fact, sufficient information exists within a sequence of vector magnetograms to determine a 3-dimensional electric field whose curl reproduces the observed changes in all 3 components of B. While this is certainly a major step forward, it is still true that the electric field E itself, as opposed to its curl, is under-constrained by the data. We will discuss how additional considerations may be used to uniquely determine all 3 components of the electric field., It is known that PWNe show a short time variability at high energies. Variability of the wisps in the Crab Nebula has long been known, the jet in Vela appears to be strongly variable, and B1509 shows also variability in the inner ring. Variability in the jet, which usually has timescale of years, on the other hand the wisps show variability on time-scale of months, much shorter than typical sound crossing time, in the form of an outgoing wave pattern, and recent results for the Crab Nebula suggest the presence of a year-long duty cycle. For a long time such variability has been interpreted as a proof of the existence of ions in the pulsar wind. I will present recent results that show that MHD models can also account for it. The internal shear between flow channels, causes the formation of eddies on scales typical of the TS, that are subsequently advected away from the TS. These eddies lead to distortion of the termination shock by changing pressure close to the cusp of the shock which results in new downstream vortexes and the Doppler boosting responsible for the arches and rings. I will present recent results concerning the dynamics of the internal flow and how this affect the X-ray emission; I will discuss the properties of such variability, and compare them with obseevations., , One of many goals of space physics is to explain the aurora. It has now become established that Alfven waves coming from the magnetotail provide significant energy for auroral acceleration processes which eventually cause the ionospheric aurora. Since other energy carriers also supply energy for auroral acceleration processes, an important question is how much energy is contributed by Alfven waves to the aurora? Another important question is where in the auroral oval does the Alfven-wave-associated aurora occur? After first reviewing some of the observational evidence for Alfven waves in the magnetotail, we will address these two questions using observational evidence., All solar activity — variations in energy released by the Sun, as electromagnetic radiation and energetic particles — is mediated by the Sun's magnetic field. Solar activity, in the form of irradiance variations, modulation of the solar wind, acceleration of solar energetic particles, and flares and coronal mass ejections, has important consequences to Earth's geomagnetic environment. Although observed at and above the photosphere, this activity necessarily arises from the coupling of the solar magnetic field to the rotating, turbulent plasma of the Sun's convective interior. Thus, to understand and better predict space weather, we must be able to describe in a quantitative way the physical connection between the Sun's convective envelope and overlying atmosphere. I will present a brief overview of recent progress toward this goal, and will present the latest results from a series of large-scale three-dimensional MHD simulations of the Sun's magnetic field in a computational domain that extends from the upper convection zone out into the corona., Recent global-scale observations of the low-latitude airglow bands associated with the equatorial ionospheric anomaly (EIA) have revealed a longitudinal variation in the brightness and latitude of the peak airglow emission. For vernal equinox conditions, both of these display a wave number-four pattern when plotted in a constant-local-time frame. It has been proposed that variations in the neutral-wind driven dynamo electric fields from the E-region are responsible for this pattern. Additionally, measurements of the electric fields in the E-region have shown a wave number-four pattern similar to that of the EIA. Here we use the SAMI2 model, that includes a detailed description of ion photochemistry and transport, to demonstrate that the recently observed zonal variations in the E-region dynamo electric fields are sufficient to explain the observed variation in brightness and latitude of the airglow bands for these conditions. The vertical drifts associated with E-region dynamo fields in the SAMI2 model are modified to produce simulations that represent the locations of a maximum and minimum in the wave number-four pattern. The simulated airglow changes such that the brightness of the maximum case is ∼40% higher than the peak in the minimum case and the latitude of the peak brightness in the maximum case is located 3° poleward of the peak in the minimum case. Both of these results compare favorably with, and even exceed, the observed variations. This result adds quantitative support to the above stated mechanism. The effect of changes in the drifts at different local time periods on the nighttime airglow is also assessed. It is seen that changes at all local time periods make a significant contribution to the total change in the airglow, with the most significant being close to local noon and during the late afternoon., The Standard Model of particle physics is one of the most successful scientific theories in history. However, despite an impressive track record of matching experimental results, the Standard Model is in many ways aesthetically dissatisfying, with finely tuned parameters which seem to require explanation via some overarching theory. In addition, the experimental facts of neutrino mass and dark matter cannot be explained in the unmodified Standard Model. In this thesis, I will describe the failings of the Standard Model and original work that helps test proposed solutions. The problems addressed herein are: the hierarchy problem; dark matter; the strong CP problem; and neutrino oscillation observation. I then demonstrate how the next generation of collider and cosmological experiments can serve to test the proposed solutions to these issues. I describe a new method for the measurement of particle spin at collider experiments, a necessary measurement in order to discriminate the signatures of various solutions to the hierarchy problem and shed light onto one possible source of dark matter. I then demonstrate that astronomical detection of a dark matter axion associated with the strong CP problem is affected by recent results from quark physics. Finally, I outline series of experimental results from colliders and underground experiments that would help test the seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses, generally held to be extremely difficult, if not impossible., The soft gamma repeaters (SGRs) have now benefitted from 30 years of space-based observations, beginning with the first Konus and SIGNE detections, and continuing today with the present IPN, as well as INTEGRAL and Swift monitoring. They have also been observed more recently by ground-based IR and radio telescopes. Small bursts, giant flares, and quiescent emission are well documented, and an IR counterpart has been identified for one SGR. I will review the current state of our knowledge of these sources, and point out our ignorance of several key parameters, such as their distances., The STEREO mission's Education and Outreach (E/PO) program began early enough its team benefited from many lessons learned as NASA's E/PO profession matured. Originally made up of discrete programs, by launch the STEREO E/PO program had developed into a quality suite containing all the program elements now considered standard: education workshops, teacher/student guides, national and international collaboration, etc. The benefit of bringing so many unique programs together is the resulting diverse portfolio, with scientists, E/PO professionals, and their education partners all of whom can focus on excellent smaller programs. The drawback is a less cohesive program nearly impossible to evaluate in its entirety with the given funding. When individual components were evaluated, we found our programs mostly made positive impact. In this paper, we elaborate on the programs, hoping that others will effectively use or improve upon them. When possible, we indicate the programs' effects on their target audiences., The twin-spacecraft STEREO mission has now been in orbit for 1.5 years. Although the main scientific objective of STEREO is the origin and evolution of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and their heliospheric consequences, the slow decline of the previous solar cycle has provided an extraordinary opportunity for close scrutiny of the quiet corona and solar wind, including suprathermal and energetic particles. However, STEREO has also captured a few late cycle CMEs that have given us a taste of the observations and analyses to come. Images from the SECCHI investigation afforded by STEREO's separated perspectives and the heliospheric imager have already allowed us to visibly witness the origins of the slow solar wind and the Sun-to-1 AU transit of ICMEs. The SWAVES investigation has monitored the transit of interplanetary shocks in 3D while the PLASTIC and IMPACT in-situ measurements provide the 'ground truth' of what is remotely sensed. New prospects for space weather forecasting have been demonstrated with the STEREO behind spacecraft, a successful proof-of-concept test for future space weather mission designs. The data sets for the STEREO investigations are openly available through a STEREO Science Center web interface that also provides supporting information for potential users from all communities. Comet observers and astronomers, interplanetary dust researchers and planetary scientists have already made use of this resource. The potential for detailed Sun-to-Earth CME/ICME interpretations with sophisticated modeling efforts are an upcoming STEREO-Hinode partnering activity whose success we can only anticipate at this time. Since its launch in September 2006, Hinode has sent back solar images of unprecedented clarity every day. The primary purpose of this mission is a systems approach to understanding the generation, transport and ultimate dissipation of solar magnetic fields with a well-coordinated set of advanced telescopes. Hinode is equipped with three telescopes: a visible light telescope, an X-ray telescope, and an extreme ultraviolet imaging spectrometer. The optical telescope has a large primary mirror measuring 50 centimeters in diameter, and is the world's largest space telescope for observing the sun and its vector magnetic fields. The impact of the Hinode optical telescope on solar physics is comparable to that of the Hubble Space Telescope on optical astronomy. Its X-ray telescope captures coronal structures in exceptional detail. The EUV imaging spectrometer possesses about ten times the sensitivity and four times the resolution of similar instruments on previous satellites. With the synergy of Hinode and STEREO, we are able to witness the entire life cycle of the solar magnetic field; namely helio-seismic observations of the subsurface flux tubes, vector magnetic observations of flux emergence and evolution by the optical telescope, flaring activity on various scales and eventual eruption in the inner corona observed by the X-ray telescope and the EUV imaging spectrometer, and their consequences in the heliosphere observed with the STEREO instruments. We look forward to the upcoming solar maximum with great expectations for a much improved understanding of how the Sun works and how it influences Earth's environment in the solar system., Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are non-nuclear point X-ray sources with X-ray luminosities intermediate between those of stellar mass black holes and supermassive black holes. Recently, theorists have proposed viable mechanisms of creating the new class of intermediatemass black holes (100-1000 Msun ) that must be necessary if accretion onto these ULXs is to obey the Eddington limit. ULXs are often associated with colliding systems. The spiral galaxy M99 is a good example: M99 has been strongly affected by tidal interactions and recent close encounters, responsible for an asymmetric spiral pattern and a high star-formation rate. My XMM-Newton study shows that at the outskirts of the galaxy, away from the main starforming regions, there is a ULX with an X-ray luminosity ∼ 1 × 1040 erg/s. This source is close to the location where a massive HI cloud appears to be falling onto the M99 disk at a relative speed &gt;100 km/s. I speculate that fast cloud collisions may trigger large-scale dynamical collapses of molecular cloud cores, leading to the formation of very massive (&gt;200 Msun ) stellar progenitors; I argue that such stars may later collapse into intermediate-mass black holes (∼100 Msun ) if their metal abundance is sufficiently low. Thus, I suggest that there is a direct link between collisional environments and intermediate-mass black hole formation., STEREO's IMPACT (In-situ Measurements of Particles and CME Transients) investigation provides the first opportunity for long duration, detailed observations of 1 AU magnetic field structures, plasma and suprathermal electrons, and energetic particles at points bracketing Earth's heliospheric location. The IMPACT team has developed both human-friendly web portals and API's (application program interfaces) which provide straight-foward data access to scientists and the Virtual Observatories. A new web browser tool provides easy access to imaging data related to events measured in-situ, and the Virtual Heliospheric Observatory incorporates STEREO data into its data system providing another powerful venue for multipoint, multi-spacecraft analysis of the heliosphere. This variety of data access techniques and the development of cross-spacecraft data analysis tools allow the larger scientific community to combine STEREO's unique in-situ data with those of other missions and, therefore, to maximize STEREO's scientific potential in gaining a greater understanding of the heliosphere., GRBs are burst of gamma-ray energy coming from cosmological distances. Recent observational results, while shedding light on their origin, have also challenged the standard accepted scenario, triggering a renewed interest in the investigation of the engine causing the release of such vast amount of energy. I will review the compelling evidence linking them to the death of massive stars. I will then discuss the Magnetar model for the central engine. I will show recent numerical results suggesting that, indeed, a GRB might be a natural outcome following the formation of a rapidly rotating magnetized neutron star, and that the correct GRB properties can be recovered in the case of a magnetar wind interaction with the surrounding progenitor. In particular I will focus on the role of the magnetic field as a natural source of collimation and acceleration. The study of GRBs, as high energy events associated with Supernovae, is also of great importance in the general context of core collapse. It can provide an interesting and alternative way to constrain the importance of magnetic field and rotation, as well as, to clarify what are the key element regulating the properties of core-collapse., Bow-Shock Pulsar Wind Nebulae form due to the interaction of the pulsar wind with the ISM, in the case of supersonic kick velocities. They were originally discovered in Hα: the emission coming from the excited ISM hydrogen crossing the bow-shock. In the case of luminous pulsar one would expect also non thermal emission from the pulsar wind, and there are now several of them that have been detected in X-rays. Interestingly, apart for one known case, they are either detected in Hα or X-rays. We report here the results of a series of observations conducted around promising candidates, looking for Hα emission. We discuss what conclusion can be derived about the conditions on the ISM density and ionization fraction, and how the data can be used to constraint the ionizing flux produced by the Neutron Star, and as a consequence to give an estimate of its surface temperature., The time-scale for galaxies within merging dark matter haloes to merge with each other is an important ingredient in galaxy formation models. Accurate estimates of merging time-scales are required for predictions of astrophysical quantities such as black hole binary merger rates, the build-up of stellar mass in central galaxies and the statistical properties of satellite galaxies within dark matter haloes. In this paper, we study the merging time-scales of extended dark matter haloes using N-body simulations. We compare these results to standard estimates based on the Chandrasekhar theory of dynamical friction. We find that these standard predictions for merging time-scales, which are often used in semi-analytic galaxy formation models, are systematically shorter than those found in simulations. The discrepancy is approximately a factor of 1.7 for M<SUB>sat</SUB>/M<SUB>host</SUB> ~ 0.1 and becomes larger for more disparate satellite-to-host mass ratios, reaching a factor of ~3.3 for M<SUB>sat</SUB>/M<SUB>host</SUB> ~ 0.01. Based on our simulations, we propose a new, easily implementable fitting formula that accurately predicts the time-scale for an extended satellite to sink from the virial radius of a host halo down to the halo's centre for a wide range of M<SUB>sat</SUB>/M<SUB>host</SUB> and orbits. Including a central bulge in each galaxy changes the merging time-scale by &lt;~10 per cent. To highlight one concrete application of our results, we show that merging time-scales often used in the literature overestimate the growth of stellar mass by satellite accretion by ~40 per cent, with the extra mass gained in low mass ratio mergers., Io's colorful appearance and unusual thermal emission have made it an object of interest for solar system astronomers for decades. Only recently have we become aware of the intimate connections between the tenuous atmosphere, the vibrant surface and the violent volcanic eruptions on this small moon. This work presents a series of studies which illuminate these three areas. Specifically, we found that there is a substantial time variability to the sulfur monoxide content of Io's atmosphere, and that the measured rotational temperature of the gas (550-1000K) implies a volcanic origin. <P />We then focused on Io's volcanism during a serendipitous discovery of a major volcanic outburst at Tvashtar Catena. The OSIRIS instrument allowed us unprecedented spatial and spectral resolution, which we used to pinpoint the location of the outburst to 59 ° 1N, 121 ° 1W. With the H and K band spectra we determined a temperature of 1240 ° 4K with a surface emitting area of 57 ° 6km 2 . <P />Finally we studied Io's surface through mapping the coverage of sulfur dioxide ice. Both low and high spatial resolution data displayed a largely equatorial distribution of ice, consistent with early studies by the Voyager and Galileo spacecraft. Importantly these results differ from some of the recent findings. We present, however, a potential unifying theory to explain this discrepancy, which may answer the long-standing question of the location of Io's ice. <P />Included in the final chapter is further discussion of some of the technical challenges faced in this research, specifically with the OSIRIS instrument and the solid surface models used to interpret the sulfur dioxide ice data., Currently, space physicists are faced with a bewildering array of heliospheric missions, experiments, and data sets available at archives distributed around the world. Daunting even for those most familiar with the field, physicists in other concentrations (solar physics, magnetospheric physics, etc.) find locating the heliospheric data that they need extremely challenging if not impossible. The Virtual Heliospheric Observatory (VHO) works to solve this problem by providing an Application Programming Interface (API) and web portal that integrates these data sets to find the highest quality data for a given task. The VHO is an ideal tool for cross-disclipinary research providing complex and powerful search capabilities and enforcing a coherent metadata standard ensuring data are independently usable and understandable., Auroral breakup, substorm injections in the near-Earth plasma sheet and ground Pi2 pulsations are phenomena associated with substorms and are the result of various physical processes. A complete understanding of how they are interrelated is still outstanding. Typically, it is understood that they occur within minutes of each other. The near-simultaneous occurrence of the various phenomena, however, does not refer to one-to-one correlations of any periodic behavior as found in Pi2 pulsations. In this study we report a substorm which showed periodic oscillations (135 s) in all three substorm phenomena which were one-to-one correlated. These observations demonstrate that the three periodic substorm phenomena had a common source which controlled the periodicity, and we will discuss possible excitation mechanisms. This combined groundand space-based study utilizes data from THEMIS, LANL, Polar, and 210MM., We present a precise estimate of the bulk virial scaling relation of halos formed via hierarchical clustering in an ensemble of simulated cold dark matter cosmologies. The result is insensitive to cosmological parameters; the presence of a trace, dissipationless gas component; and numerical resolution down to a limit of ~1000 particles. The dark matter velocity dispersion scales with total mass as log [σ<SUB>DM</SUB>(M,z)] = = log(1082.9 +/- 4.0 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) + (0.3361 +/- 0.0026)log[h(z)M<SUB>200</SUB>/10<SUP>15</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>], with h(z) being the dimensionless Hubble parameter. At fixed mass, the velocity dispersion likelihood is nearly lognormal, with scatter σ<SUB>ln σ</SUB> = 0.0426 +/- 0.015, except for a tail with higher dispersions containing 10% of the population that are merger transients. We combine this relation with the halo mass function in ΛCDM models and show that a low normalization condition, S<SUB>8</SUB> = σ<SUB>8</SUB>(Ω<SUB>m</SUB>/0.3)<SUP>0.35</SUP> = 0.69, favored by recent WMAP and SDSS analysis requires that galaxy and gas-specific energies in rich clusters be 50% larger than that of the underlying dark matter. Such large energetic biases are in conflict with the current generation of direct simulations of cluster formation. A higher normalization, S<SUB>8</SUB> = 0.80, alleviates this tension and implies that the hot gas fraction within r<SUB>500</SUB> is ( 0.71+/- 0.09) h<SUP>-3/ 2</SUP><SUB>70</SUB> Ω <SUB>b</SUB>/ Ω <SUB>m</SUB>, a value consistent with recent Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations., The measurement of pickup oxygen ions is arguably one of the most important goals of Venus and Mars missions studying atmosphere evolution. There is also ongoing debate about how much oxygen escapes due to the classical ion pickup process involving a convection electric field (E=-VxB) acceleration versus other processes. We used a test particle model to demonstrate that VEX orbital and detector sampling make it difficult to observe the full variation of the classical pickup O+ flux due to the variable interplanetary magnetic field clock angle and strength. We found that extreme conditions, which are of particular interest, present a special problem because of highly inclined IMFs and the reduction in gyroradius of the picked up O+. We examine a similar model for Mars pickup O+ and consider how the MEX orbit presents comparable difficulties, which also pose a challenge for future missions and observers trying to sort out escape processes and fluxes., In recent decades astronomers and physicists have accumulated a vast array of evidence that the bulk of the universe's matter is in some non-baryonic form that remains undetected by electromagnetic means. This ""dark matter"" resides in diffuse halos surrounding galaxies and other cosmic structures. Particle theorists have proposed a wide array of candidates for its nature. One particularly promising class of candidates are Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs): quanta with masses of order 100 GeV/c 2 and interactions characteristic of the weak nuclear force. <P />The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) experiment seeks to directly detect the rare elastic interactions of galactic WIMPs with terrestrial nuclei. To this end, CDMS operates an array of crystalline Ge and Si particle detectors in Soudan Underground Laboratory in northern Minnesota. These crystals are operated at millikelvin temperatures and instrumented to measure the ionization and athermal phonons generated by each particle interaction. This combination provides a powerful two-fold discrimination against the interactions of particles generated by radioactive decay and cosmogenic showers. <P />This dissertation describes the commissioning, analysis, and results of the first WIMP-search data runs of the CDMS experiment with its full complement of 5 ""Towers"" of detectors. These data represent a substantial increase in target mass and exposure over previous CDMS results. The results of this work place the most stringent limits yet set upon the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross section for WIMP masses above ~ 44 GeV/c 2 , as well as setting competitive limits on spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon interactions. This work also outlines the larger context of this and other probes of the WIMP theory of dark matter, as well as some current development efforts toward a larger cryogenic experiment., The ∼ 14 km diameter Jänisjärvi impact structure is located in Svecofennian Proterozoic terrain in the southeastern part of the Baltic shield, Karelia, Russia. Previous radioisotopic dating attempts gave K/Ar and <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar ages of 700 ± 5 Ma and 698 ± 22 Ma, respectively, with both results being difficult to interpret. Recent paleomagnetic results have challenged these ages and proposed instead ages of either 500 Ma or 850-900 Ma. In order to better constrain the age of the Jänisjärvi impact structure, we present new <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar data for the Jänisjärvi impact melt rock. We obtained five concordant isochron ages that yield a combined isochron age of 682 ± 4 Ma (2 σ) with a MSWD of 1.2, P = 0.14, and <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>36</SUP>Ar intercept of 475 ± 3. We suggest that this date indicates the age of the impact and therefore can be used in conjunction with existing paleomagnetic results to define the position of the Baltica paleocontinent at that time. Argon isotopic results imply that melt homogenization was achieved at the hundred-micrometer scale certainly, because of the low-silica content of the molten target rock that allows fast <SUP>40</SUP>Ar <SUP>*</SUP> diffusion in the melt. However, the large range of F( <SUP>40</SUP>Ar <SUP>*</SUP><SUB>inherited</SUB>) (4.1% to 11.0%) observed for seven grains shows that complete isotopic homogenization was not reached at the centimeter and perhaps the millimeter scale. The F( <SUP>40</SUP>Ar <SUP>*</SUP><SUB>inherited</SUB>) results are also in good agreement with previous Rb and Sr isotopic data., I outline a mechanism, akin to Weibel instabilities of interpenetrating beams, in which the neighboring current sheets in a striped wind from an oblique rotator interact through a two stream-like mechanism (a Weibel instability in flatland), to create an anomalous resistivity that heats the sheets and causes the magnetic field to diffusively annihilate in the wind upstream of the termination shock. The heating has consequences for observable unpulsed emission from pulsars., Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are the result of the very energetic death of white dwarfs. Because of their large and homogeneous peak optical luminosities, astronomers have used these nearly standard candles as distance indicators. Comparing the apparent magnitudes of low- and high-redshift ( z [approximate] 0.5) SNe Ia at peak have shown that a ""dark energy"" having negative pressure is currently causing the expansion of the Universe to accelerate. In this context, we present several studies of SN Ia spectra. (1) We show optical spectra ofSN 1997ex, a SN Ia at z = 0.361, obtained at three different epochs. Comparison with spectra of low-redshift SNe Ia allows us to measure a time dilation consistent with that expected by cosmological redshift and inconsistent with alternative theories. (2) We present a large sample of ultraviolet (UV) spectra of low-redshift SNe Ia; these appear to have features that correlate with peak optical luminosity. In particular, we show a correlation between luminosity and ""UV slope,"" a parameter that describes the shape of the UV spectrum. (3) We have obtained an extensive sample of optical spectra of high-redshift SNe Ia during the first four years of the ESSENCE project, a survey to discover and follow ~200 SNe Ia over six years in order to constrain the properties of dark energy. (4) By creating several composite spectra from the high-redshift sample, we are able to examine both low-amplitude spectral features and the average spectral properties 2 of the sample. Comparison with composites of the optical and UV spectra of low-redshift SNe Ia shows that SN Ia spectral features differ by [Special characters omitted.] 10% between z = 0 and z [approximate] 0.4. (5) We present a sample of high-quality optical spectra of SNe Ia at z [approximate] 0.25 discovered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II) Supernova Survey. By examining individual spectra as well as a composite spectrum, we detect a near-UV excess in the high-redshift sample, relative to a low-redshift sample of SNe Ia. The near-UV excess may indicate SN Ia evolution between z = 0 and z = 0.25. We further find that the high-redshift relationship between peak luminosity and UV slope is inconsistent with that found for the low-redshift sample. Finally, we summarize all of these results in the context of SN Ia cosmology and future surveys., The current resonance structure of the Kuiper belt suggests that during the late stages of planet formation, Neptune migrated outward as it scattered residual planetesimal debris. Extrasolar planetary systems also show evidence for planetary migration. Approximately 1/5 of the extrasolar planets discovered to date are ""hot Jupiters,"" which likely exchanged angular momentum with gas disks, migrating large distances inward to reach their current semi-major axes of ~0.05 AU. In this thesis, I discuss three consequences of planetary migration. <P />(1) During its migration, Neptune captured Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) into mean motion resonances. The current spatial distribution of KBOs in a particular resonance, the 2:1, acts as a celestial speedometer--fast planetary migration generates a larger population of 2:1 resonant KBOs trailing rather than leading Neptune on the sky. We provide an explanation of this phenomenon for the first time. Central to our understanding is how planetary migration shifts the equilibrium points of the superposed direct and indirect potentials felt by a KBO. The currently observed distribution of 2:1 KBOs excludes total migration times &lt; 20 Myr with &gt;99.65% confidence and is statistically consistent with the even population generated by slow migration. However, these observations are beset by systematic uncertainties. Observations with new telescopes such as PanSTARRS or LSST will tell us how quickly Neptune could have migrated. <P />(2) Neptune's migration, powered by scattering planetesimal debris, was stochastic (""noisy""). Extreme stochasticity defeats resonance capture. We construct a theory analogous to Brownian motion for how a planet's orbital semi-major axis fluctuates in response to random planetesimal scatterings. The degree of stochasticity in Neptune's migration depends both on the sizes of the planetesimals driving migration and on their orbital elements and cannot currently be computed using N-body simulations. We find that capture of resonant Kuiper belt objects by a migrating Neptune remains effective if the bulk of the primordial disk was locked in bodies having sizes [Special characters omitted.] km and if the fraction of disk mass in objects with sizes [Special characters omitted.] 1000 km was less than a few percent. Coagulation simulations produce a size distribution of primordial planetesimals that easily satisfies these constraints. We conclude that stochasticity did not interfere with Neptune's ability to capture and retain KBOs in first-order resonances during its migration. <P />(3) Photoionization heating from UV radiation incident on the atmospheres of hot Jupiters drives planetary mass loss. Observations of stellar Lyman- a absorption at high velocities (±100 km s -1 ) have suggested that the hot Jupiter HD 209458b is losing atomic hydrogen. We show that mass loss takes the form of a hydrodynamic (""Parker"") wind, emitted either from the planet's dayside during lulls in the stellar wind, or from the nightside when heat is transported there by horizontal flows. A hot Jupiter loses at most ~0.06% of its mass during its host star's pre-main-sequence phase and ~0.6% of its mass during the star's main sequence lifetime. At no stage do planetary winds reach velocities of ±100 km s -1 . We conclude that while UV radiation does indeed drive winds from hot Jupiters, such winds cannot significantly alter planet ary masses during any evolutionary stage, nor can they generate the observed decrements in Lya flux in HD 209458b., , The X-ray signature of charge exchange between highly charged L-shell iron ions and neutral gas atoms was studied in the laboratory in order to assess its diagnostic utility. Significant differences with spectra formed by electron-impact excitation were observed. In particular, a strong enhancement was found of the emission corresponding to n &gt;= 4→ n = 2 transitions relative to the n = 3→ n = 2 emission. This enhancement was detectable even with relatively low-resolution X-ray instrumentation (E/Δ E ≈ 10) and may enable future identification of charge exchange as a line-formation mechanism in astrophysical spectra., We investigate accelerated electrons observed by Mars Global Surveyor (MGS), using data from the Electron Reflectometer (ER) instrument. We find three different types of accelerated electron events. Current sheet events occur over regions with weak or no crustal fields, have the highest electron energy fluxes, and are likely located on draped magnetotail fields. Extended events occur over regions with moderate crustal magnetic fields, and are most often observed on closed magnetic field lines. Localized events have the lowest energy fluxes, occur in strong magnetic cusp regions, and are the most likely kind of event to be found on open magnetic field lines. Some localized events have clear signatures of field-aligned currents; these events have much higher electron fluxes, and are preferentially observed on radially oriented open magnetic field lines. Electron acceleration events, especially localized events, are similar in many ways to events observed in the terrestrial auroral zone. However, physical processes related to those found in the terrestrial cusp and/or plasmasheet could also be responsible for accelerating electrons at Mars., The result of this work is a measurement of the 8 B solar neutrino flux using neutrino-electron elastic scattering in KamLAND with a 5 MeV threshold. KamLAND is a 1 kilo-ton liquid scintillating detector located in Kamioka, Japan. The total 118 kt-day exposure results in a flux of 1.87±0.24(stat.)±0.32(syst.) × 10^6 cm -2 s -1 . The uncertainty in the measurement is dominated by the statistics of the candidate sample and the uncertainty in 11 Be production from muon spallation. This result is consistent with previous measurements and predictions from the Standards Solar Model with matter enhanced neutrino oscillation., Using Lunar Prospector data, we review the magnetic field and electron signatures of solar wind interaction with lunar crustal magnetic sources. Magnetic field amplifications, too large to represent direct measurements of crustal fields, appear in the solar wind over strong crustal sources, with the chance of observing these amplifications depending on upstream solar wind parameters. We often observe increases in low-energy (≲100 eV) electron energy fluxes simultaneously with large magnetic field amplifications, consistent with an increase in plasma density across a shock surface. We also often observe low frequency wave activity in the magnetic field data (both broadband turbulence and monochromatic waves), often associated with electron energization, sometimes up to keV energies. Electron energization appears to be correlated more closely with wave activity than with magnetic amplifications. Detailed studies of the interaction region will be necessary in order to understand the physics of the Moon solar wind interaction. At present, the Moon represents the only natural laboratory available to us to study solar wind interaction with small-scale crustal magnetic fields, though simulation results and theoretical work can also help us understand the physical processes at work., Using data from Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) in combination with Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations of reconnection, we present the first direct evidence of collisionless magnetic reconnection at Mars. The evidence indicates that the spacecraft passed through the diffusion region where reconnection is initiated and observed the magnetic field signatures of differential electron and ion motion - the Hall magnetic field - that uniquely indicate the reconnection process. These are the first such in-situ reconnection observations at an astronomical body other than the Earth. Reconnection may be the source of Mars' recently discovered auroral activity and the changing boundaries of the closed regions of crustal magnetic field., Comparisons of asymmetric magnetic field reconnection at the subsolar magnetopause are made between satellite data and computer simulations for the ratio of the antiparallel components of the magnetic fields at the boundaries being about three and the density ratio being 10 to 30. The bipolar electric field and quadrupolar magnetic field of symmetric reconnection are not found in either the simulations or the experimental data because the Hall term in the generalized Ohm's Law (the leading term on its right side on the ion scale) is a factor up to 100 smaller on the magnetosheath side of the current layer than on the magnetospheric side. Average plasma densities and fields at six THEMIS magnetopause crossings agree with open simulations provided that the experimental data is in the joint variance, not minimum variance, frame. This is because the magnetic field component normal to the assumed planar current sheet is not constant for asymmetric reconnection while it is forced to be approximately constant by the mathematics of minimum variance analyses. A north-south asymmetry of the fields and flows in asymmetric reconnection is found in both the simulations and the space measurements. The simulations and the satellite data both have regions the order of the electron skin depth in size that contain significant electric fields. In such structures, parallel electric fields exist in the simulation throughout the current layer. Such parallel fields are similar to those reported earlier from Polar satellite data., In this work I present the results of the very successful Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS), and in particular I focus on the determination of the supernova rate (SNr) in the local universe. With 844 supernovae (620 discovered by LOSS and 224 independently rediscovered by LOSS) from the beginning of the search in 1997 through the end of 2006, the search has provided significant improvement over previous nearby SNr calculations by reducing the primary uncertainty, small-number statistics. Furthermore, the use of a CCD camera and image subtraction techniques during the SN search have decreased observational biases suffered by previous SN searches with photographic plates, such as missing SNe near galaxy nuclei or in high-inclination galaxies. <P />Great care has been taken to collect information on the monitored galaxy sample and discovered SN sample, and to calculate control times for each of the galaxies using realistic limiting magnitudes derived from LOSS's detailed observational logs. With this combination of meticulous record-keeping and large number of SNe, we have been able to determine the most accurate nearby SNr to date. For each of the three main SN types (Ia, Ib/c, II) and even some peculiar subtypes (SNe Ia 1991bg and 1991T), we have determined the SNr per unit luminosity and per unit mass as a function of host-galaxy morphology or B - K color. We have also determined the SNr per unit volume for z &lt; 0.05. <P />The implications of these latest supernova rates are discussed; in particular, we highlight the study of type Ia SN progenitors because of the cosmological significance of type Ia supernovae. Our results support the conclusion that there is a bimodal distribution among SN Ia progenitors, but we cannot draw any conclusions regarding whether there is evolution of the progenitor systems with redshift. Finally, we apply our extragalactic SNr to our own Milky Way Galaxy, finding a rate consistent with (but slightly higher than) the SNr based on observations of SN-related phenomena within the Galaxy., [Chapter 1] Jupiter's Great Red Spot (GRS) has been observed in sufficient detail that we can use it to determine properties of the Jovian atmosphere that cannot otherwise be found. These properties include: the potential vorticity of the GRS and its neighboring zonal jet streams, the shear imposed on the GRS by the jet streams, and the vertical entropy gradient (i.e., Rossby deformation radius). We show that the cloud cover of the GRS, which is often used to define the GRS's area and aspect ratio, differs significantly from the region of the GRS's potential vorticity anomaly. <P />[Chapter 2] The stratification of Jupiter's weather layer, as well as various parameters that describe the potential vorticity distribution of Jupiter's jetstreams and vortices, cannot be measured directly. On the other hand, the horizontal velocity fields of the vortices and jetstreams can be measured, and the PDEs that govern the flow--the Quasi-Geostrophic equations or the more complex Shallow-Water equations--show that the horizontal velocity field is a sensitive function of the unknown parameters. This suggests that the unknown parameters can be estimated by solving an inverse problem. Specifically, parameter values can be sought such that a velocity field described by the governing equations matches the measured velocity field to within the observational uncertainties. Previous attempts to solve this inverse problem used expensive initial-value simulations of the governing equations, and were therefore restricted to manual explorations of parameter space. Here a new numerical method is presented for computing steady-state velocity fields of the Quasi-Geostrophic and Shallow-Water equations that resemble flows on Jupiter. This numerical method, which is several orders of magnitude more efficient than an equivalent initial-value solver, is combined with a genetic algorithm to efficiently and robustly search a relatively large portion of parameter space for ""best-fit"" values of the unknown parameters. <P />[Chapter 3] Using a fast steady-solver coupled with a genetic algorithm, we have solved inverse problems for Jupiter's Great Red Spot (GRS), Oval BA and their ambient jet streams. We found ""best-fit"" values of the properties of the ambient atmosphere, such as its vertical stratification (parametrized by the Rossby deformation radius), as well as of the size, shape and strengths of the potential vorticity (PV) anomalies that define the GRS and Oval BA. We also found ""best-fit"" values of the locations and PV gradients of the jet streams. Uncertainties of the ""best-fit"" parameters are determined with Monte Carlo methods. Our main conclusions are that the areas of the clouds of the GRS and Oval are much larger than the areas of their PV anomalies., An essential component of the STEREO IMPACT investigation is its nearly 6 m long boom that provides several of the instruments with a sufficiently clean magnetic environment and minimally restricted fields of view, while having the required rigidity to ensure the spacecraft pointing accuracy for the STEREO imaging investigations. Details of the customized telescoping IMPACT Boom design, construction and testing are described in this review. The successful completion and verification of the IMPACT Booms represents a demonstration of the use of Stacers as motive forces for rigid boom deployment., Interpretation of cosmological data to determine the number and values of parameters describing the universe must not rely solely on statistics but involve physical insight. When statistical techniques such as ""model selection"" or ""integrated survey optimization"" blindly apply Occam's Razor, this can lead to painful results. Sensitivity to prior probabilities and to the number of models compared can lead to ""prior selection"" rather than robust model selection. A concrete example demonstrates that information criteria can in fact misinform over a large region of parameter space., The 3rd interplanetary network, which has been in operation since 1990, presently consists of 9 spacecraft: AGILE, RHESSI, Suzaku, and Swift, in low Earth orbit; INTEGRAL, in eccentric Earth orbit; Wind, up to 4 light-seconds from Earth; MESSENGER, en route to Mercury; Mars Odyssey, in orbit around Mars; and Ulysses, in heliocentric orbit. The IPN operates as a full-time, all-sky monitor for transients. It detects about 200 cosmic gamma-ray bursts and SGR bursts per year. These events are generally not the same ones detected by narrow field of view instruments such as Swift and INTEGRAL IBIS. We will discuss the sensitivity of the IPN and review some of its more interesting recent discoveries, such as possible extragalactic giant magnetar flares. We will also discuss the future operations of the network, and explain how the public data can be retrieved., We present observations of the HCN and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> J = 1-0 transitions in the center of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 6946 made with the BIMA and CARMA interferometers. Using the BIMA SONG CO map, we investigate the change in the I<SUB>HCN</SUB>/I<SUB>CO</SUB> and I<SUB>HCO<SUP>+</SUP></SUB>/I<SUB>CO</SUB> integrated intensity ratios as a function of radius in the central kiloparsec of the galaxy and find that they are strongly concentrated at the center. We use the 2MASS K<SUB>s</SUB>-band image to find the stellar surface density and then construct a map of the hydrostatic midplane pressure. We apply a PDR model to the observed I<SUB>HCN</SUB>/I<SUB>HCO<SUP>+</SUP></SUB> integrated intensity ratio to calculate the number density of molecular hydrogen in the dense gas tracer emitting region and find that it is roughly constant at 10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> across our map. We explore two hypotheses for the distribution of the dense gas. If the HCN and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> emission comes from self-gravitating density peaks inside of a less dense gas distribution, there is a linear proportionality between the internal velocity dispersion of the dense gas and the size of the density peak. Alternatively, the HCN and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> emission could come from dense gas homogeneously distributed throughout the center and bound by ambient pressure, similar to what is observed toward the center of the Milky Way. We find both of these hypotheses to be plausible. We fit the relationships between I<SUB>HCN</SUB>, I<SUB>HCO<SUP>+</SUP></SUB>, and I<SUB>CO</SUB>. Correlations between the hydrostatic midplane pressure and I<SUB>HCN</SUB> and I<SUB>HCO<SUP>+</SUP></SUB> are demonstrated, and power-law fits are provided. We confirm the validity of a relation found by Blitz &amp; Rosolowsky between pressure and the molecular to atomic gas ratio in the high hydrostatic midplane pressure regime (10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> K)., The IMPACT (In situ Measurements of Particles And CME Transients) investigation on the STEREO mission was designed and developed to provide multipoint solar wind and suprathermal electron, interplanetary magnetic field, and solar energetic particle information required to unravel the nature of coronal mass ejections and their heliospheric consequences. IMPACT consists of seven individual sensors which are packaged into a boom suite, and a SEP suite. This review summarizes the science objectives of IMPACT, the instruments that comprise the IMPACT investigation, the accommodation of IMPACT on the STEREO twin spacecraft, and the overall data products that will flow from the IMPACT measurements. Accompanying papers in this volume of Space Science Reviews highlight the individual sensor technical details and capabilities, STEREO project plans for the use of IMPACT data, and modeling activities for IMPACT (and other STEREO) data interpretation., In past years, measurements of the solar wind plasma have advanced our understanding of MHD turbulence tremendously. At small scales, the solar wind is believed to be ve`xry multifractal with nonlinear interactions causing an intermittent energy dissipation, leading to possible current-sheet structures. In this Letter, we propose a systematic data analysis procedure to examine the existence of current sheets in the solar wind. We show that by studying the integrated distribution function F(θ , ζ) of the angle between two unit magnetic fields \hat{\boldsymbol{b}}(t) and \hat{\boldsymbol{b}}(t+\zeta) , as well as its ζ-dependence, one can unambiguously identify the existence of current-sheet-like structures in the solar wind. Using this procedure, we analyze magnetic field data from the VHM/FGM instrument on board the spacecraft Ulysses for two periods, one in solar maximum and the other in solar minimum. In both cases, current sheets are clearly inferred. Furthermore, we also outline a procedure that allows the identification of the actual locations of these current sheets. Results from our analysis and the implications of the existence of current sheets in the solar wind are discussed., We model the interaction between the wind from a newly formed rapidly rotating magnetar and the surrounding progenitor. In the first few seconds after core collapse the magnetar inflates a bubble of plasma and magnetic fields behind the supernova shock, which expands asymmetrically because of the pinching effect of the toroidal magnetic field, as in PWNe, even if the host star is spherically symmetric. The degree of asymmetry depends on the ratio of the magnetic energy to the total energy in the bubble. We assume that the wind by newly formed magnetars inflating these bubbles is more magnetized than for PWNe. We show that for a magnetic to total power supplied by the central magnetar ~0.1 the bubble expands relatively spherically while for values greater than 0.3, most of the pressure in the bubble is exerted close to the rotation axis, driving a collimated outflow out through the host star. This can account for the collimation inferred from observations of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Given that the wind magnetization increases in time, we thus suggest that the magnetar-driven bubble initially expands relatively spherically (enhancing the energy of the associated supernova) while at late times it becomes progressively more collimated (producing the GRB). Similar processes may operate in more modestly rotating neutron stars to produce asymmetric supernovae and lower energy transients such as X-ray flashes., The STEREO/WAVES experiment is designed to measure the electric component of radio emission from interplanetary radio bursts and in situ plasma waves and fluctuations in the solar wind. Interplanetary radio bursts are generated from electron beams at interplanetary shocks and solar flares and are observed from near the Sun to 1 AU, corresponding to frequencies of approximately 16 MHz to 10 kHz. In situ plasma waves occur in a range of wavelengths larger than the Debye length in the solar wind plasma λ<SUB>D</SUB>≈10 m and appear Doppler-shifted into the frequency regime down to a fraction of a Hertz. These phenomena are measured by STEREO/WAVES with a set of three orthogonal electric monopole antennas. This paper describes the electrical and mechanical design of the antenna system and discusses efforts to model the antenna pattern and response and methods for in-flight calibration., A portable microfabricated capillary electrophoresis (CE) system named the Mars Organic Analyzer (MOA) has been developed to analyze fluorescently-labeled biomarkers including amino acids, amines, nucleobases, and amino sugars with the goal of life detection on Mars (1,2). This system consists of a multilayer microfabricated glass wafer containing electrophoresis channels as well as microfluidic valves and pumps for sample manipulation, a confocal laser excitation and fluorescence detection system, and integrated CE power supplies. The MOA has been successfully field tested in the Panoche Valley, CA and in the Atacama Desert, Chile, detecting amino acids at the ppb levels (3). In addition, this technology has been shown to be effective in screening the formation of biogenic amines during fermentation (4). The MOA is a part of the Urey instrument package that has been selected for the 2013 European ExoMars mission by ESA. The identification of recent gully erosion sites, observations of ice on and beneath the surface of Mars, and the discovery of large reservoirs of sub-surface ice on Mars point to water-ice as an important target for astrobiological analyses (5). In addition, the ice moons Europa and Enceladus are of astrobiological interest due to the possibility that they may contain liquid water under their ice crusts. Consequently, we explore here the use of the MOA instrument for the analysis of amino acids in polar ice samples. Soil extracts as well as concentrated icecore samples tend to be highly saline and inhomogeneous. Furthermore, brine pockets in ice form potential refugia for extant extra-terrestrial life, rendering near surface ice a key target for the search for a record of past life on the planet (6). Therefore, we have determined the effect of salinity on sample injection parameters in ice-core samples retrieved from Greenland. The amino acids valine, alanine/serine, glycine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid were found in the parts-per-billion range from these ice-core samples. Chiral analysis of these samples yielded D/L ratios of 0.51/0.09 for alanine/serine and 0.14/0.06 for aspartic acid. Individual amino acids in the parts-per-trillion range were found in Antarctic ice samples collected from the surface of a meteorite collection area. The distinct amino acid and amine content of these samples indicates that further biomarker characterization of ice samples as a function of sampling location, depth, and structural features will be highly informative. The rapid sensitive analysis capabilities demonstrated here establish the feasibility of using the MOA to analyze the biomarker content of ice samples in planetary exploration. 1. Skelley, A.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 2000, 97, 1247-1251., , This work is a collection of discrete scientific inquiries that revolve around high-velocity clouds (HVCs) and single-dish radio observations of the 21 cm line of H I. We first describe the state of our knowledge of HVCs and how they may relate to broader questions of galactic evolution and star formation. We then go on to describe the GALFA-H I survey, a large survey of Galactic H I being conducted at the Arecibo Observatory. We show many new techniques for reducing systematic contaminants to the H i data. We also explain a novel technique for determining the distance to HVCs through the study of the morphology of their disruption by gas in the Galactic halo. We find this technique to be consistent with other indirect distance measures. In Chapter 4 we compare high-resolution smooth particle hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation to observations of HVCs, and find very good agreement in terms of velocities, fluxes, distances and angular distribution on the sky. We also predict the existence of a large number of low-velocity halo clouds (LVHCs), analogs to HVCs, but without high radial velocity. In the final chapter we conduct a large search for these LVHCs by comparing infrared observations with GALFA-H I data. We find two such clouds in our pilot study. We also recover the known fact that HVCs have little infrared dust emission and confirm the hypothesis that intermediate-velocity clouds have smaller, hotter dust grains than the standard ISM. We also show that HVC complex M is a local cloud, akin to the intermediate-velocity arch, rather than a member of the halo., In the last few years, new observations by CHANDRA and XMM have shown that Pulsar Wind Nebulae present complex but similar inner features, with the presence of axisymmetric rings and jets, which are generally referred to as a jet-torus structure. Due to the rapid growth in accuracy and robustness of numerical schemes for relativistic fluid-dynamics, it is now possible to model the flow and magnetic structure of the relativistic plasma responsible for the emission. Recent results have clarified how the jet and rings are formed, suggesting that the morphology is strongly related to the wind properties, so that, in principle, it is possible to infer the conditions in the unshocked wind from the nebular emission. I will review here the current status in the modeling of Pulsar Wind Nebulae, and, in particular, how numerical simulations have increased our understanding of the flow structure, observed emission, polarization and spectral properties. I will also point to possible future developments of the present models., We report on observations of a gamma-ray burst (GRB 061126) with an extremely bright (R ≈ 12 mag at peak) early-time optical afterglow. The optical afterglow is already fading as a power law 22 s after the trigger, with no detectable prompt contribution in our first exposure, which was coincident with a large prompt-emission gamma-ray pulse. The optical-infrared photometric SED is an excellent fit to a power law, but it exhibits a moderate red-to-blue evolution in the spectral index at about 500 s after the burst. This color change is contemporaneous with a switch from a relatively fast decay to slower decay. The rapidly decaying early afterglow is broadly consistent with synchrotron emission from a reverse shock, but a bright forward-shock component predicted by the intermediate- to late-time X-ray observations under the assumptions of standard afterglow models is not observed. Indeed, despite its remarkable early-time brightness, this burst would qualify as a dark burst at later times on the basis of its nearly flat optical-to-X-ray spectral index. Our photometric SED provides no evidence of host galaxy extinction, requiring either large quantities of gray dust in the host system (at redshift 1.1588 +/- 0.0006, based on our late-time Keck spectroscopy) or separate physical origins for the X-ray and optical afterglows., We propose to measure the weak cosmic shear using the spatial derivatives of the galaxy surface brightness field. The measurement should be carried out in Fourier space, in which the point spread function (PSF) can be transformed to a desired form with multiplications, and the spatial derivatives can be easily measured. This method is mathematically well defined regardless of the galaxy morphology and the form of the PSF, and involves simple procedures of image processing. Furthermore, with high-resolution galaxy images, this approach allows one to probe the shape distortions of galaxy substructures, which can potentially provide much more independent shear measurements than the ellipticities of the whole galaxy. We demonstrate the efficiency of this method using computer-generated mock galaxy images., Using galaxy samples drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey, we study the relationship between star formation and environment at z ~ 0.1 and 1. We estimate the total star formation rate (SFR) and specific star formation rate (sSFR) for each galaxy according to the measured [OII] λ 3727 Å nebular line luminosity, corrected using empirical calibrations to match more robust SFR indicators. Echoing previous results, we find that in the local Universe star formation depends on environment such that galaxies in regions of higher overdensity, on average, have lower SFRs and longer star formation time-scales than their counterparts in lower density regions. At z ~ 1, we show that the relationship between sSFR and environment mirrors that found locally. However, we discover that the relationship between total SFR and overdensity at z ~ 1 is inverted relative to the local relation. This observed evolution in the SFR-density relation is driven, in part, by a population of bright, blue galaxies in dense environments at z ~ 1. This population, which lacks a counterpart at z ~ 0, is thought to evolve into members of the red sequence from z ~ 1 to ~0. Finally, we conclude that environment does not play a dominant role in the cosmic star formation history at z &lt; 1: the dependence of the mean galaxy SFR on local galaxy density at constant redshift is small compared to the decline in the global SFR space density over the last 7Gyr., Context: Multi-conjugate adaptive optics (MCAO) combine the advantages of both standard adaptive optics, which provide high contrast and high spatial resolution, and of wide field imaging (≈1'). Up to recently, MCAO for astronomy was limited to laboratory experiments. In this paper, we present the first scientific results obtained with the first MCAO instrument. <BR />Aims: We present a new study of the Trapezium cluster using deep MCAO images with a field of view of 1'×1' obtained at the VLT. <BR />Methods: We used deep J, H, and Ks images recently obtained with the prototype MCAO facility MAD at the VLT to search for new members and new multiple systems in the Trapezium cluster. On bright targets (Ks≈9 mag), these images allow us to reach ΔKs≈6 mag as close as 0.4 arcsec. <BR />Results: We report detection of 128 sources, including 10 new faint objects in the magnitude range between 16.1 &lt; Ks &lt; 17.9 mag. In addition to all previously known multiple systems with separations greater than 0.1 arcsec, we confirm the multiplicity of TCC-055. We also report the detection in J, H, and Ks of a very red extended embedded protostellar object, HC 419, previously detected only in the thermal infrared. <BR />Conclusions: Analysis of the first MCAO images obtained on the sky demonstrates not only the technical feasibility of MCAO, but also its great potential and versatility in terms of scientific output. <P />Observations made at the ESO Paranal Observatory., We study the long term evolution of magnetic fields generated by an initially unmagnetized collisionless relativistic e<SUP>+</SUP>e<SUP>-</SUP> shock. Our 2D particle-in-cell numerical simulations show that downstream of such a Weibel-mediated shock, particle distributions are approximately isotropic, relativistic Maxwellians, and the magnetic turbulence is highly intermittent spatially, non-propagating, and decaying. Using linear kinetic theory, we find a simple analytic form for these damping rates. Our theory predicts that the overall magnetic energy decays as (ω<SUB>p</SUB> t)<SUP>-q</SUP> with q ~ 1, which compares favorably with simulations, but predicts overly rapid damping of short-wavelength modes. The magnetic trapping of particles within the magnetic structures may be the origin of this discrepancy. We conclude that initially unmagnetized relativistic shocks in electron-positron plasmas are unable to form persistent downstream magnetic fields. These results put interesting constraints on synchrotron models for the prompt and afterglow emission from GRBs., We present time-dependent axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the interaction of a relativistic magnetized wind produced by a proto-magnetar with a surrounding stellar envelope, in the first ~10 s after core collapse. We inject a super-magnetosonic wind with into a cavity created by an outgoing supernova shock. A strong toroidal magnetic field builds up in the bubble of plasma and magnetic field that is at first inertially confined by the progenitor star. This drives a jet out along the polar axis of the star, even though the star and the magnetar wind are each spherically symmetric. The jet has the properties needed to produce a long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB). At ~5 s after core bounce, the jet has escaped the host star and the Lorentz factor of the material in the jet at large radii ~10<SUP>11</SUP> cm is similar to that in the magnetar wind near the source. Most of the spindown power of the central magnetar escapes via the relativistic jet. There are fluctuations in the Lorentz factor and energy flux in the jet on a ~ 0.01-0.1 s time-scale. These may contribute to variability in GRB emission (e.g. via internal shocks)., The Cassini MIMI instrument has observed energetic protons and oxygen ions in Saturn's&amp;pouter magnetosphere. These ions can precipitate into Titan's atmosphere and drive several important processes. The gyroradii of these energetic ions is large compared to the size of Titan. It is thought that Titan's induced magnetosphere should not play a role in the ion precipitation process. We test weather this is indeed the case using Monte Carlo simulations of the energetic ions. We examine the spatial distribution of these energetic ions as they cross the exobase. Calculate to what degree the induced magnetosphere affects the ion flux into the exobase as a function of the incident ion energy. We also calculate how much energy these ions contribute to Titan's atmosphere, where it is deposited and some of the consequences these precipitating ions have on Titan's&amp;patmosphere., Impulsive solar energetic particle (SEP) events are characterized by a high e/p ratio and over-abundance of He3. To decipher the underlying acceleration process of these events, it is crucial to deduce precisely the injection time of electrons and ions from the observed time intensity profiles at 1 AU. In a collisionless plasma like the solar wind, the propagation of electrons and ions follows the Parker spiral magnetic field lines, subject to pitch angle scattering due to the presence of solar wind magnetic turbulence. The effect of the pitch angle scattering is to alter particle pitch angles in a random manner during their propagation, leading to a prolonged propagation time and a less-focused pitch angle distribution. In this work, we study the transport of electrons in impulsive SEP events. The pitch angle scattering is investigated using a direct Monte-Carlo technique where the underlying Fokker-Planck transport equation is solved by casting it to a set of equations describing single particle's motion. By following the trajectories of individual particles, the time intensity profiles and pitch angle distributions at 1 AU are obtained. We discuss the comparison of our simulation results to observations by WIND/3DP and its implications on the interplanetary turbulence spectrum., As a wide field, imaging space telescope SNAP can provide unique capabilities to probe the cosmic expansion history a(t) and dark energy, map the formation and evolution of large scale structure, and explore astrophysics in the high redshift universe including black holes, quasars, and star formation out to z=10. Rich data sets of optical and near infrared imaging to AB mag 28 over thousands of square degrees, and to AB=30 in the deep survey, with space quality imaging resolution, will open exciting discovery potential for many fields of astronomy and cosmology., Information on the sources of the fast solar wind during the recent period of low solar activity has been obtained by STEREO, ACE and SOHO, for the first time from three perspectives. These observations are complemented by routinely available global models that help us to infer connections between in-situ properties and specific solar features. During the end of the current declining phase, starting around Carrington Rotation 2050 and lasting for almost ten solar rotations, the high speed stream sources were well-defined mid-southern-latitude coronal holes, distinct from the main southern polar coronal hole in the images and the models. The ability to reproduce the solar wind velocity at this time with models that rely on coronal flux tube divergence as a parameter suggest that the global aspects of fast solar wind generation cannot be neglected. Another notable observation is the ability of the mid-to-low latitude sources to retain their coherence and importance in the face of the usual differential rotation, supergranular diffusion, and meridional circulation that act on their photospheric magnetic field boundary. We use the in-situ observations, particularly of solar wind and suprathermal electrons, together with the images of the corona and the models to investigate from the multipoint perspective how these fast solar wind sources work., Synthetic anorthite aggregates were deformed in a Paterson gas deformation apparatus at confining pressures up to 400 MPa in torsion and axial compression at temperatures between 950 °C and 1200 °C. Samples deformed in torsion under Newtonian creep display development of texture (or crystallographic preferred orientation) as documented with synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements. Complex diffraction patterns were deconvoluted with the Rietveld method to obtain quantitative texture information. Torsion samples deformed up to shear strains of 4 and samples deformed in compression at higher stresses to total strains of 0.3 develop clear textures. Texture and shape preferred orientation (SPO) of torsion samples display a monoclinic pattern with an asymmetry inclined against the sense of shear, consistent with polycrystal plasticity simulations that assume the deformation is accomplished by dislocation glide. These results show that a material deforming in linear-viscous creep can develop a strong texture, in striking contrast to the paradigm that the presence of a texture precludes low-stress Newtonian behavior. Our observations show that the presence or absence of crystallographic preferred orientation is not sufficient to uniquely infer the dominant rheological/mechanical regime, as sometimes applied for interpretation of seismic anisotropy in the Earth., We will present recent 3D MHD simulation results of eruptive flux-rope formation via the magnetic breakout mechanism to provide a theoretical/modeling context for multipoint in-situ observations. Many generic observational CME properties are reproduced by this idealized eruption as it propagates through the low corona (~10 R\odot). Recently, STEREO observed a ""classic"" flux-rope ICME on 22 May 2007 with different in- situ field and plasma signatures seen at each spacecraft. The same event was also seen by WIND and ACE, arriving at L1 arriving a few hours before either STEREO A or B. We will describe a preliminary analysis of the large-scale heliospheric structure of the ICME flux-rope utilizing the linear, force-free cylinder model fits to the in- situ magnetic field rotations in order to determine the ICME's relative simplicity and/or consistency with the standard Magnetic Cloud cartoon picture. A comparison between the data, the derived in-situ cylinder orientations at three spacecraft, and the CME large-scale magnetic structure inferred from the MHD simulation results in the low corona show a reasonable qualitative agreement. BJL would like to acknowledge support from NSF ATM-0621725 as a SHINE Postdoc, and thank the STEREO, WIND and ACE teams for making their data readily available., We have previously shown, using Lunar Prospector data, that the nightside lunar surface can reach potentials as large as several kilovolts negative during SEP events. These large surface charging events may have significant effects on the lunar surface and exospheric environment (including dust), and therefore have intriguing implications from both a pure science and an exploration perspective. We now build on this initial result to further investigate the response of the lunar surface to SEP events. We present the results of investigations into two aspects of this response: 1. How does the response of the lunar surface to different SEP events vary, and what features of specific SEP events make them more efficient at charging the surface to large potentials? 2. How does the lunar surface response vary as a function of solar zenith angle, and can we explain this response in terms of the expected charged particle access to the surface? By answering these questions, we can make significant steps towards understanding the complex coupled system formed by the interactions of the lunar surface, lunar exosphere, and solar plasma., Three moveable telescopes operating at mid-IR wavelengths and with heterodyne detection are used for interferometry and phase closure for measurement of the sizes, shapes, variations in size, and surrounding dust shells of old stars, with some emphasis on Miras. Baselines vary from 4 meters to 75 meters and are in a variety of directions. It is found that IR radiation from some stars does not correspond to circularity and some stars are even asymmetric. Dust shell productions are often separated by several years., The Far-Ultraviolet Imager (IMAGE-FUV) on-board the NASA IMAGE satellite has been used to observe plasma depletions in the nightside equatorial ionosphere. Observations from periods around spacecraft apogee, during which equatorial regions are visible for several hours, have allowed the velocity of these plasma depletions to be determined. A new method for determining the velocity of these depletions using an image analysis technique, Tracking Of Airglow Depletions (TOAD), has been developed. TOAD allows the objective identification and tracking of depletions. The automation of this process has also allowed for the tracking of a greater number of depletions than previously achieved without requiring any human input, which shows that TOAD is suitable for use with large data sets and for future routine monitoring of the ionosphere from space. Furthermore, this allows the drift velocities of each depletion to be determined as a function of magnetic latitude as well as local time. Previous ground-based airglow observations from a small number of locations have indicated that the drift velocities of depletions may vary rapidly with magnetic latitude. Here we shall present the first results from TOAD of this shear in drift velocities from our global sample of depletion drift velocities., The ongoing eruption of water vapor and ice on Enceladus and proposed past eruptions of liquid water on Europa have led to discussion about the feasibility of cracking a planetary ice shell. We use a boundary element method to model crack propagation in an elastic layer subjected to tension and hydrostatic compression. We consider the presence of a region at the base of the ice shell in which the far-field extensional stresses vanish due to viscoelastic relaxation, impeding the propagation of fractures towards the subsurface ocean. The maximum extent of fracture propagation can be limited by hydrostatic pressure or by the presence of the unstressed basal zone, depending on its thickness. Our simulation results indicate that Enceladus' ice shell may be cracked if it is capable of supporting ~1-3 MPa tension and is less than ~30 km thick. Europa's ice shell may only be cracked under 1-3 MPa tension if it is about 1 km thick., The magnetic connectivity, topology and properties including magnetic flux changes, magnetic gradient and flow field from LCT of three active regions will be derived from photospheric magnetograms and synoptic maps to understand the initiation condition of eruptions/flares originated from the regions and the potential impact on the heliosphere and magnetosphere. The three active regions are AR10930 in December 2006 and AR10953 and AR10956 in May 2007. AR10930 and AR10956 are responsible for the two Magnetic Clouds observed by IMPACT on STEREO A/B during the first half year of the mission. The associated coronal CME/flare/filament activities will be studied using solar imaging data from SOHO, STEREO, BBSO and HINODE. We will analyze photospheric magnetograms and synoptic maps from MDI and GONG. Vector magnetic field observations from HINODE and SOLIS are currently being sought and if available will be value added information for initiation of the eruptions. PFSS model field line tracing based on the synoptic maps gives the magnetic topology and connectivity in the active region and the global large scale field. The large scale field results including regions with closed arcades and fields open to the interplanetary space give the context and relative location of the source region of the eruptions., HST/WFPC2 images of Jupiter from 2000, before the current upheaval, showed thick and nearly complete cloud coverage in the equatorial zone. Images from 2006/2007 show a decrease in cloud cover; most remaining clouds are associated with plumes extending from the northern and southern boundaries of the equatorial zone. The decreased cloudiness corresponds to a 20-30% decrease in the 953-nm continuum I/F within ± 5° of the equator, between 2000 and 2007. A preliminary comparison with 892-nm methane band images from both epochs suggests that the tropospheric haze, located just above the upper cloud sheet and just below the tropopause, is unchanged. The fine aerosols composing this haze may be composed of condensed hydrazine (a product of ammonia photolysis at the altitude of the haze layer) mixed with smaller amounts of hydrocarbon and other photochemical products drifting down from the stratosphere (Atreya et al., Icarus 31, 1977; Atreya et al., Plan. Sp. Sci. 53, 2005). Cloud particles from deeper in the troposphere may also be lofted into the haze region (West et al., Icarus 65, 1986), where particles with radii &lt; 1 {μ}m precipitate on a timescale of about a year (Rossow, Icarus 36, 1978). Due to the large energies needed to penetrate into the stably stratified haze region, particle compositions may include NH4HS and H2O as well as NH3. If the clearing of equatorial clouds associated with the upheaval persists for several years, it will provide an opportunity to compare the contributions of the two haze formation mechanisms. The observed reduction in equatorial cloud cover implies a drop in the upward transport of fine particles, which would lead to a reduction of tropospheric haze within 1-3 years, as the small particles gradually fall out of the upper troposphere. Hydrazine haze should be in a steady state balance between photochemical production and loss through particle growth, precipitation, and evaporation. The reduced equatorial cloud opacity will lead to warming in the haze layer, with changes apparent in about 5 years according to estimates of the radiative timescale (Conrath et al., Icarus 83, 1990). Monitoring Jupiter's haze and cloud opacity over the next few years may therefore constrain the origin of the upper tropospheric haze, with rapid changes implying a significant source from deeper tropospheric condensation clouds., The strong degeneracy of the <SUP>12</SUP>C ignition layer on an accreting neutron star results in a hydrodynamic thermonuclear runaway, in which the nuclear heating time becomes shorter than the local dynamical time. We model the resulting combustion wave during these superbursts as an upward-propagating detonation. We solve the reactive fluid flow and show that the detonation propagates through the deepest layers of fuel and drives a shock wave that steepens as it travels upward into lower density material. The shock is sufficiently strong on reaching the freshly accreted H/He layer that it triggers unstable <SUP>4</SUP>He burning if the superburst occurs during the latter half of the regular type I bursting cycle; this is likely the origin of the bright type I precursor bursts observed at the onset of superbursts. The cooling of the outermost shock-heated layers produces a bright, ~0.1 s, flash that precedes the type I burst by a few seconds; this may be the origin of the spike seen at the burst onset in 4U 1820-30 and 4U 1636-54, the only two bursts observed with RXTE at high time resolution. The dominant products of the <SUP>12</SUP>C detonation are <SUP>28</SUP>Si, <SUP>32</SUP>S, and <SUP>36</SUP>Ar. Gupta et al. showed that a crust composed of such intermediate-mass elements has a larger heat flux than one composed of iron-peak elements and helps bring the superburst ignition depth into better agreement with values inferred from observations., Radio-frequency E1 transitions between nearly degenerate, opposite-parity levels of atomic dysprosium (Dy) were monitored over an 8-month period to search for a variation in the fine-structure constant α . During this time period, data were taken at different points in the gravitational potential of the Sun. The data are fitted to the variation in the gravitational potential yielding a value of (-8.7±6.6)×10<SUP>-6</SUP> for k<SUB>α</SUB> , the variation of α in a changing gravitational potential. This value gives the first laboratory limit independent of assumptions regarding other fundamental constants. In addition, our value of k<SUB>α</SUB> combined with other experimental constraints is used to extract the first limits on k<SUB>e</SUB> and k<SUB>q</SUB> . These coefficients characterize the variation of m<SUB>e</SUB>/m<SUB>p</SUB> and m<SUB>q</SUB>/m<SUB>p</SUB> in a changing gravitational potential, where m<SUB>e</SUB> , m<SUB>p</SUB> , and m<SUB>q</SUB> are electron, proton, and quark masses. The results are k<SUB>e</SUB>=(4.9±3.9)×10<SUP>-5</SUP> and k<SUB>q</SUB>=(6.6±5.2)×10<SUP>-5</SUP> . All these results indicate the absence of significant variation at the present level of sensitivity., Domes in the the `Borealis back-basin' (centre 76N 160W) on Mars resemble products of mud volcanism (MV) on Earth. Description of domes: Our mapping shows ~30 Early Amazonian domes in the back-basin (~50 x 40 km, height ~300 m). Many have marginal and central peaks (~7 x 5 km, height ~400 m), and moats ~2.5 km wide. Domes are rough at km-scale; some have central depressions; some have annular ridges. Mean rise/run is (0.93±0.22)%. Dome orientations, and alignments of multiple domes, run parallel to the continuation of grabens associated with Alba Patera diking [1]. Distributary channels are found in association with one dome. Aspect-frequency plots for the domes region show significant deviations from randomness. (Detrended) slopes facing S or N are more common than other aspects; local maxima are (S±5°) and (N±5°). N-facing slopes are more abundant than S-facing slopes, so mean S- facing slope must be steeper. A control region at the same latitude shows no comparable anomaly. Interpretation: Many worlds show igneous volcanism, but only Earth has confirmed MV. So, when assessing an extraterrestrial construct, one should assign a high prior probability to igneous volcanism. However, (1) Dome morphologies can be matched with MV in the Caspian Basin and Cadiz Gulf [2], though Martian domes have diameters ~5 times greater. (2) Moat morphometry excludes flexural origin and suggests a collapse origin. Collapse moats are often associated with MV on Earth. (3) Aspect anomalies suggest that near-surface dome material was subject to insolation-driven processing, requiring dome near-surface material to have been partially volatile [3]. (4) Volcanic constructs are rare closer to Alba Patera, inferred to have triggered dome construction. So there must be a major increase in the fusibility of materials in our basin. In the absence of Martian granites, volatile-rich deposits satisfy this requirement. (5) Mars' thick sediment piles permit MV. Crater fill studies suggest that the Scandia and Borealis back- basins contain the greatest thickness of cover in the Northern Plains, making these preferred MV locations [4]. We infer that domes may well result from MV. Outstanding puzzles: We currently lack a compelling mechanism for expulsion in the extensional tectonic setting required for dyking. One possibility is direct triggering of MV through intersection of dyke fluids with a volatile-rich sediment column. OMEGA spectra of domes show no significant differences between dome and non-dome terrain. Band depth methods and linear unmixing models [5] yield compositions uniformly dominated by ferric oxides and pyroxenes. This may be due to recent mantling, or MV may tap a source layer of similar composition to adjacent plains. Implications: Post-Hesperian cover in our study area is too thin for MV; older sediments are probably the source. These may record catastrophic flooding or oceans. Our results have implications for the ease of future drill-rig access to these ancient deposits. There is also a tempting geographic link with young evaporates [6].

One of the primary goals of the Nearby Supernova Factory (SNfactory) is to investigate this diversity through spectrophotometric observation of a large number of nearby SNe Ia. Recent studies of the SNe Ia rate have revealed a strong relationship with stellar progenitor population, a potential source for diversity in SNe Ia. We will present the spectroscopic observations of over 70 host galaxies from the SNfactory set of SNe Ia in parallel with an analysis of spectroscopic properties of those SNe Ia., Observations by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) have shown that ""super-hot"" (T &gt; ~30~MK) thermal plasmas are a somewhat common feature of (large) flares of GOES class M or X. However, the origins and evolution of such super-hot plasmas are still poorly understood. RHESSI observes solar photons &gt;3 keV with a spectral resolution of ~1~keV FWHM, and is especially sensitive to flare plasmas hotter than ~10~MK. RHESSI's rich data set allows an unprecedented level of analysis of thermal flare plasma through imaging and spectroscopic observations of the thermal bremsstrahlung continuum and the Fe and Fe/Ni line complexes at ~6.7 and ~8~keV. Accurately characterizing the thermal plasma provides information about flare heating and cooling mechanisms and improves our understanding of flare energy transport and release. We present early results of a statistical survey of hot thermal plasmas in ~300 RHESSI-observed M/X-class flares (2002-2005), utilizing an analytical method to compare the thermal continuum and line emission (Caspi &amp; Lin 2007). We present flare energetics, size, and temperature distributions and discuss the implications for the origins of super-hot thermal plasmas., In this poster, we compare auroral events seen in the ultraviolet emission imaged by Polar UVI with plasma and fields data detected by instruments onboard the THEMIS satellite. Global images offer a clear indication of onset times for isolated substorm events. An example of one such event took place on March 23, 2007. UVI recorded a substorm onset at 1110 UT near local midnight. The onset recorded by magnetometers on the ground was 1118 UT, 8 minutes later, only after the arrival of a westward surge at the ground station. This substorm, as in many substorms, was accompanied by pseudo-breakup events before the onset of the auroral expansion. Additionally, in the local morning sector, pulsations were seen during substorm recovery. The THEMIS probes at this time were located between 9 and 13 RE in the pre-midnight sector. THEMIS observed particle injections and dipolarization signatures propagating from one probe to another. Large ion flows and magnetic field fluctuations were seen during the substorm intensitifcation at 1118 UT as the disturbance propagated westward to the probe locations, thus illustrating the importance of global auroral images in placing the magnetospheric observations in context., During the first 6 months of its mission, the 5 THEMIS spacecraft have been operating in a ""string of pearls"" orbit that provides multi-spacecraft observations of magnetospheric processes on distance scales of .1 - 2 RE. The large gyro radii of the energetic particles measured by the Solid State Telescope (SST) experiment provide an additional means of determining spatial gradients from a single spacecraft. In this study we examine a ~2 hour interval on August 28, 2007 with large (+/-100 km/sec) periodic (~5 minute period) velocity fluctuations observed while the spacecraft where just inside the pre-noon magnetopause., Beneath the Pacific Northwest the Juan de Fuca plate, a remnant of the Farallon plate, continues subducting beneath the North American continent. To the east of the Cascadia subduction zone lies the Yellowstone Hotspot Track. The origins of this track can be traced back to the voluminous basaltic outpourings in the Columbia Plateau around 17 Ma. If these basalts are the result of a large melting anomaly rising through the mantle to the base of the North American continent, such as a mantle plume head, the anomaly would need to punch through the subducting Juan de Fuca slab. Here, we use teleseismic body-wave travel-time tomography to investigate the fate of the subducted slab and its possible interaction with a plume head. Our dataset is derived from the Oregon Array for Teleseismic Study (OATS) deployment in Oregon and all other available seismic data in this region during the same period. In our JdF07 models, we image the subducted Juan de Fuca plate in the mantle east of the Cascades beneath Oregon, where the slab has not been imaged before, to a depth of 400 km but no deeper. The slab dips ∼ 50°E and has a thickness of ∼ 75 km. Immediately beneath the slab, we image a low velocity layer with a similar geometry to the slab and extending down to at least ∼ 575 km depth in the V <SUB>s</SUB> model. The total length of the high velocity slab is ∼ 660 km, about 180 km longer than the estimated length of slab subducted since 17 Ma. Assuming similar slab geometry to today, this 180 km length of slab would reach ∼ 60 km depth, comparable to the thickness of continental lithosphere. We propose that the absence of the slab below 400 km today is due to the arrival of the Yellowstone plume head ∼ 17 Ma, which destroyed the Juan de Fuca slab at depths greater than the thickness of the continental lithosphere. Given this scenario, the low velocity anomaly beneath the slab is likely the remnant plume head material which has been pulled down by traction with the subducting plate. The amplitude of the observed low velocity anomaly is comparable with that expected for plume head material 100-300 °C hotter than the surrounding asthenosphere., Observations of outflows associated with pre-main-sequence stars reveal details about morphology, binarity, and evolutionary states of young stellar objects. We present molecular line data from the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association array and Five Colleges Radio Astronomical Observatory toward the regions containing the Herbig Ae/Be stars LkHα 198 and LkHα 225S. Single-dish observations of <SUP>12</SUP>CO J=1-0, <SUP>13</SUP>CO J=1-0, N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP> J=1-0, and CS J=2-1 were made over a field of 4.3<SUP>'</SUP>×4.3<SUP>'</SUP> for each species. <SUP>12</SUP>CO J=1-0 data from FCRAO were combined with high-resolution BIMA array data to achieve a naturally weighted synthesized beam of 6.75<SUP>''</SUP>×5.5<SUP>''</SUP> toward LkHα 198 and 5.7<SUP>''</SUP>×3.95<SUP>''</SUP> toward LkHα 225S, representing resolution improvements of factors of approximately 10 and 5 over existing data. By using uniform weighting, we achieved another factor of 2 improvement. The outflow around LkHα 198 resolves into at least four outflows, none of which are centered on LkHα 198-IR, but even at our resolution we cannot exclude the possibility of an outflow associated with this source. In the LkHα 225S region we find evidence for two outflows associated with LkHα 225S itself, and a third outflow is likely driven by this source. Identification of the driving sources is still resolution limited and is also complicated by the presence of three clouds along the line of sight toward the Cygnus molecular cloud. <SUP>13</SUP>CO J=1-0 is present in the environments of both stars along with cold, dense gas as traced by CS J=2-1 and (in LkHα 225S) N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP> J=1-0. No 2.6 mm continuum is detected in either region in relatively shallow maps compared to existing continuum observations., We present new observations of PKS 2155-304 with the Chandra Low Energy Transmission Grating (LETG), using the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS). We confirm the detection of an absorption line plausibly identified as O VIII Lyα from a warm-hot intergalactic medium associated with a small group of galaxies along the line of sight, as originally reported by Fang and coworkers. Combining the previous observations by Fang and coworkers with five new long observations on the same target, we increase the total exposure time by a factor of 3 and the total counts per resolution element by a factor of 5. The measured line equivalent width is smaller than that observed by Fang and coworkers, but still consistent at 90% confidence. We also analyze the XMM-Newton observations on the same target, as well as observations using the combination of the Chandra LETG and the High Resolution Camera (HRC). These observations have been used to challenge our reported detection. While no line is seen in either the XMM-Newton or the Chandra LETG+HRC data, we find that our result is consistent with the upper limits from both data sets. We attribute the nondetection to (1) the higher quality of the Chandra LETG+ACIS spectrum and (2) the rather extended wings of the line-spread functions of both the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) and the Chandra LETG+HRC. We discuss the implication of our observation on the temperature and density of the absorber. We also confirm the detection of z~0 O VII absorption, and, comparing with previous Chandra analysis, we obtain much tighter constraints on the line properties., We calculate durations and spectral parameters for 218 Swift bursts detected by the BAT instrument between and including gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) 041220 and 070509, including 77 events with measured redshifts. Incorporating prior knowledge into the spectral fits, we are able to measure the characteristic νF<SUB>ν</SUB> spectral peak energy E<SUB>pk,obs</SUB> and the isotropic equivalent energy E<SUB>iso</SUB> (1-10<SUP>4</SUP> keV) for all events. This complete and rather extensive catalog, analyzed with a unified methodology, allows us to address the persistence and origin of high-energy correlations suggested in pre-Swift observations. We find that the E<SUB>pk,obs</SUB>-E<SUB>iso</SUB> correlation is present in the Swift sample; however, the best-fit power-law relation is inconsistent with the best-fit pre-Swift relation at &gt;5 σ significance. It has a factor &gt;~2 larger intrinsic scatter, after accounting for large errors on E<SUB>pk,obs</SUB>. A large fraction of the Swift events are hard and subluminous relative to (and inconsistent with) the pre-Swift relation, in agreement with indications from BATSE GRBs without redshift. Moreover, we determine an experimental threshold for the BAT detector and show how the E<SUB>pk,obs</SUB>-E<SUB>iso</SUB> correlation arises artificially due to partial correlation with the threshold. We show that pre-Swift correlations found by Amati et al., Yonetoku et al., and Firmani et al., and independently by others are likely unrelated to the physical properties of GRBs and are likely useless for tests of cosmology. Also, an explanation for these correlations in terms of a detector threshold provides a natural and quantitative explanation for why short-duration GRBs and events at low redshift tend to be outliers to the correlations., We present a split-step complex Padé-Fourier migration method based on the one-way wave equation. The downward-continuation operator is split into two downward-continuation operators: one operator is a phase-shift operator and the other operator is a finite-difference operator. A complex treatment of the propagation operator is applied to mitigate inaccuracies and instabilities due to evanescent waves. It produces high-quality images of complex structures with fewer numerical artefacts than those obtained using a real approximation of a square-root operator in the one-way wave equation. Tests on zero-offset data from the SEG/EAGE salt data show that the method improves the image quality at the cost of an additional 10 per cent computational time compared to the conventional Fourier finite-difference method., Previous work [Chua et al., 2004] computed the substorm recovery time scale for over three hundred substorms observed by the Polar Ultraviolet Imager (UVI). When sorted according to season, the substorm recovery times were well ordered by whether or not the nightside auroral region was sunlit: substorms occurring in the winter and equinox periods had similar recovery time scales which were both roughly a factor of two longer than that for summer when the auroral oval was sunlit. These results strongly suggest that simultaneous auroral intensifications in the northern and southern hemispheres develop differently during solstice conditions. We expect the auroral breakup in the dark (winter) hemisphere to be more intense and longer lived than that observed in the sunlit (summer) hemisphere. This also implies that more energy is deposited by electron precipitation in the winter hemisphere than in the summer one during a substorm. Here we extend this previous work by including a similar number of substorms observed by IMAGE Far Ultraviolet Imager (FUV) as well as simultaneous, conjugate auroral substorm observations by Polar UVI and the IMAGE FUV. The observed hemispheric asymmetry and non-conjugacy of auroral substorms is consistent with the suppression of discrete aurora in sunlight and highlights the importance of ionospheric conductivity plays in global-scale dynamics of the aurora and in magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling., The five-satellite NASA THEMIS Mission was launched on 17 February 2007 into a common set of low-inclination, high apogee (~15-Re) orbits, pending placement into their final mission orbits starting in September 2007. Each satellite carries a full complement of electromagnetic and particle instruments, including a three-axis Electric Field Instrument (EFI) covering the range from DC to 8 kHz with both waveform and spectral data, with limited spectral coverage from 100-400 kHz. The EFI was fully-deployed on three of the five THEMIS spacecraft in May-June 2007, and have observed various electromagnetic phenomena at spacecraft separations of a few hundred to 1000 km separations. Once deployed on all five probes, the EFI will form an essential component of the substorm and auroral-related observations provided by THEMIS. The initial results from EFI operations in the dayside magnetosphere are quite promissing, both in terms of quasi-DC observations of Hall electric fields at the magnetopause, as well as wave observations of various whistler-mode phenomena throughout the magnetosphere, magnetosheath, and solar wind. Significant electrostatic wake effects due to the presence of cold plasma throughout the dayside magnetosphere suggest that such effects will be very important for future missions, such as MMS and RBSP. Examples of each sort of phenomena will be presented and interpreted., A critical issue for understanding the origin of the Earth's geochemical reservoirs is whether chondritic meteorites are an adequate model for the bulk composition of the Earth, even for refractory lithophile elements. One way to address this issue is to document the extent of isotopic homogeneity in the early solar system by studying in detail the isotopic composition of different meteorite classes, and comparing them to Earth, Mars, and the Moon. We present new Ca isotope measurements of bulk chondritic meteorites that show non-mass dependent differences among ordinary chondrites and Earth for the more abundant and lighter Ca isotopes-masses 40, 42, 43 and 44. The measurements are made using TIMS, and isotope ratios are normalized to a constant 42Ca/44Ca. The fractionation-corrected 40Ca/44Ca ratios in meteorites vary from -3 to +2 epsilon units (0.01%) relative to the terrestrial ratio. The typical analytical uncertainty is ±0.015%. The observed variations could be caused by differences in either 40Ca or 42Ca abundance. The 43Ca/44Ca ratio shows minimal variation. The observed effects are near the limits of analytical resolution, due to incompletely understood inconsistencies in Ca isotope analysis using multi-collector TIMS, but must be nucleosynthetic in origin. Hence the data suggest that the solar system was heterogeneous with respect to Ca isotopes, and some fraction of this heterogeneity was preserved through the accretion process. The Ca data add to previously documented variation in isotopes of Cr, Mo, Ba, Sm, and Nd in chondrites. Carbonaceous chondrites Allende (CV3) and Murchison (CM2) yield the highest 40Ca enrichments (+2.0 ±1.2 and +1.1 ±0.8 in units of 0.01%), whereas ordinary chondrites Saint Severin (LL6) and Bruderheim (L6) exhibit the lowest (-3.3 ±0.7 and -3.6 ±1.8). The 40Ca isotopic effects in chondrites show correlations with reported effects in \triangle 17O, 54Cr, and 53Cr. There is a weak correlation between high 40Ca and low 142Nd, but meteorites with both high and low 40Ca have 142Nd lower than terrestrial. The observed nuclear effects in Ca isotopes can be accounted for by differences in the relative contributions of Ca made during supernova explosions (explosive O-Si burning) versus Ca made in dominantly s-process nucleosynthesis such as occurs in AGB stars. There is still no single model that can account for all observed isotopic data, but evidence is mounting that incomplete mixing of a heterogeneous solar nebula must be accounted for in the assessment of the formation age and evolution of geochemical reservoirs in the Earth's interior., During the first 6 months of the THEMIS mission, the five spacecraft were configured in a string-of-pearls that sampled the dayside magnetosphere revealing the dominance of cold plasma in this region. Although cold ions can only be detected when MP motion increases their energy in the spacecraft frame allowing penetration of the spacecraft potential, comparisons of electron density with ion density provide identification of the hidden cold ions. Spacecraft potential is also used to infer hidden cold plasma, supporting the plasma measurements. As expected, the largest cold plasma densities are observed in the post-noon sector where plasmaspheric plumes are convected to the magnetopause. These multi-spacecraft measurements offer a unique picture of the spatial and temporal structure of these plumes. Order of magnitude density variations over 100 km scales are observed indicating these plumes can be highly structured. Plume densities &gt;10/cc near the magnetopause were observed on a dozen orbits, with one observation revealing 60/cc. Cold plasma is generally found to dominate the number density in the post-noon sector by a factor of 10-100 over the hot component. These measurements indicate that cold plasma must play a major role in magnetospheric dynamics, affecting wave dispersion relations, field line resonances, and reconnection. This paper will focus on structure revealed by the multi- satellite measurements., The impact risk is extremely uncertain for objects of order 0.1-1 km diameter, with kinetic energies in the range 100 to 1 million Mt (megaton TNT ~ 4×1015 J) and recurrence times estimated in thousands to many tens of thousands of years. Millennial timescales are especially interesting, since the character of explosions (e.g. impacts, large volcanic eruptions) that only occur every 103 to 104 years lies just beyond the reckoning of modern cultural history. The impact rate predicted for the Earth based on observing nearby objects is much higher than the endemic rate estimated by counting known craters on Earth's surface. We have examined the latest account of confirmed craters from the Earth Impact Database (http://www.unb.ca/passc/ImpactDatabase/) over the last 100 Ma. The cratering record contains a large gap between 35 and 5 Ma, during which the apparent impact rate drops by an order of magnitude. The gap occurs during a period of substantial climate change, notably the initiation of large scale permanent glaciers, based on climate proxies from deep-sea sediment cores. A likely partial explanation is that climate change eroded or precluded crater formation in the recent geologic past. Taken together with constraints from inner solar system cratering and observations of near earth objects, the apparent gap in crater formation suggests that the terrestrial impact record is grossly incomplete over timescales much shorter than 100 Ma. If the true impact rate is more commensurate with the higher rates inferred from the local planetary environment, then some of the explosive fallout layers now observed in ice cores may actually be the result of recent impacts rather than volcanic eruptions. Like very large eruptions, impact ejecta are likely to be widely distributed, since impactors disrupt all levels of the atmosphere and generate ballistic debris and vapor plumes that can rise above the stratosphere. Polar ice core records of the last ~50-100 ka have become sufficiently extensive and synchronized to suggest an emerging pattern between explosive volcanic layers and abrupt climate change, although atmospheric focusing and preservation of deposits complicate analysis. By comparing ice core ash and acid signals of explosive volcanic fallout in Antarctica and Greenland, we have identified a number of common horizons which likely resulted from ""eruptions"" that dispersed material world-wide. These events appear to have preferentially occurred during onsets or intensifications of cooling phases, contributing to long-standing debates over possible feedbacks between climatic and geologic phenomena. The correlation may be evidence that abrupt climate change and associated changes in sea level and ice sheets can trigger volcanism. An intriguing and conspicuous alternative possibility is that catastrophic explosions force long term cooling. A relatively high rate for small impact events (objects hundreds of meters in size) could imply that impacts (instead of volcanism) are a causal factor in some of the climate variations observed during the last million years. Our method of optically probing outward from the boreholes created by ice coring missions is capable of detecting particulate layers which are invisible or largely missing in the cores, identifying candidate horizons for chemical analyses. Deliberate and discriminative analysis of the ""ash"" layers in ice cores could shed light on the recent impact rate. This research was supported by grant NSF ANT-0440609., We present the results of an analysis of the world SNe data, complemented by a new dataset of low-redshift nearby-Hubble-flow SN Ia. This ""Union"" compilation of nearly 400 SN Ia includes the recent large samples of SNe Ia from the Supernova Legacy Survey and the ESSENCE Survey, the older datasets, as well as the recently extended dataset of distant supernovae observed with HST. A single, consistent and blind analysis procedure is used for all the various SN Ia subsamples. We present the latest results from this Union compilation and its combination with other cosmological measurements (CMB and BAO), and discuss the cosmological constraints on the dark energy density. With the addition of our new nearby Hubble-flow SNe Ia, these resulting cosmological constraints are currently the tightest available. While our results are consistent with a cosmological constant, we obtain only relatively weak constraints on an equation of state, w, that varies with redshift. In particular, the current data do not yet significantly constrain w at z &gt; 1. <P />This work has been supported by the Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy, through contract DE-AC02-05CH11231., We present new observations of density holes upstream of Earth's bow shock. Density holes are regions of density depletions below the solar wind level with scale length of an ion gyroradius. They represent the smallest nonlinear ion structures produced by the solar wind. The edges of density holes have strong currents and as the holes propagate earthward the magnetic field evolves nonlinearly into a shock-like structure.We have examined how the solar wind energy flux changes as it approaches the density holes. The ith component of the energy flux 2Qi = nm2i&gt; + nm i&gt;2 + 2nm i?vj&gt;j&gt; + nm2?vi&gt; is measured by the plasma instrument on Cluster. We will identify how macroscopic and microscopic energies of ions flow and vary in the neighborhood of density holes. These observations have the potential to provide information on how the solar wind energy is dissipated and plasmas transported across collisionless boundaries., We will present multi-spacecraft observations by STEREO A and B and WIND of a magnetic cloud in the interplanetary space on May 21-23, 2007. At that time the angular separation between STEREO A and B was nearly 10 degrees. The differences in the observed magnetic field signatures at the locations of the spacecrafts suggest that they crossed the different parts of the magnetic cloud. STEREO B observed a very clear rotation of the magnetic field direction and presumably crossed the cloud close to the center whereas STEREO A likely traversed the leg of the magnetic cloud. Although the magnetic field maximum within this cloud was ~17 nT it did not produce significant geomagnetic response since the Z-component of the magnetic field was orientated northward. We will analyze the structure of the magnetic cloud at each spacecraft in order to deduce its larger-scale structure and orientation. In addition, we will study the solar source region of the magnetic cloud as well as the coronagraph and radio wave observations., We investigate halo mass selection properties of red-sequence cluster finders using galaxy populations of the Millennium Simulation (MS). A clear red sequence exists for MS galaxies in massive haloes at redshifts z &lt; 1, and we use this knowledge to inform a cluster-finding algorithm applied to 500h<SUP>-1</SUP>Mpc projections of the simulated volume. At low redshift (z = 0.4), we find that 90 per cent of the clusters found have galaxy membership dominated by a single, real-space halo, and that 10 per cent are blended systems for which no single halo contributes a majority of a cluster's membership. At z = 1, the fraction of blends increases to 22 per cent, as weaker redshift evolution in observed colour extends the comoving length probed by a fixed range of colour. Other factors contributing to the increased blending at high z include broadening of the red sequence and confusion from a larger number of intermediate-mass haloes hosting bright red galaxies of magnitude similar to those in higher mass haloes. Our method produces catalogues of cluster candidates whose halo mass selection function, p(M|N<SUB>gal</SUB>, z), is characterized by a bimodal lognormal model with a dominant component that reproduces well the real-space distribution, and a redshift-dependent tail that is broader and displaced by a factor of ~2 lower in mass. We discuss implications for X-ray properties of optically selected clusters and offer ideas for improving both mock catalogues and cluster finding in future surveys., Since launch the THEMIS spacecraft have traversed the boundary layer of mixed magnetosheath/magnetospheric plasmas spanning the Earth's magnetopause multiple times. This is a region charaterised by a broad spectrum of electromagnetic fluctuations over a frequency range of mHz up to the local ion gyro-frequency. In this presentation we examine the properties of these waves with particular emphasis on mode conversion from surface or fast mode waves to kinetic Alfven waves on the Alfven speed gradients that exist across the magnetopause. We examine the subsequent particle acceleration processes that these waves may drive within the magnetosphere and provide estimates of the ability of these waves to transport magnetosheath plasmas across the magnetopause into the magnetosphere., We have measured the viscosity of argon to 1.5 GPa and 353 Kelvin, 4% sodium-chloride water solution to 1.1 GPa at room temperature, and water up to 4.0 GPa and 500 Kelvin using an externally-heated, rolling-sphere diamond-cell viscometer. The viscosity of argon increases by a factor of three between 0.5 GPa and the crystallization pressure of 1.2 GPa. The viscosity of the sodium-chloride solution exhibits the same relative change as pure water, about a factor of 2 over 1 GPa. Surprisingly, we were able to compress water past the crystallization pressure at room temperature, and measure viscosity of metastable liquid water up to 1.4 GPa. The maximum viscosity attained was ~ 3 mPa*s, and appears to be consistent with simple extrapolations from both the low-pressure data (&lt; 1 GPa) and the high-temperature, high-pressure data (&gt; 323 K, ~1.5 GPa). Virtually no data previously existed for aqueous solutions at high pressures, and our experiments increase the pressure range for extensive viscosity measurements on H2O and Ar by 50%. Measurements using the diamond-cell viscometer with heating capability provide significant tests of theoretical models of fluid-transport properties at conditions existing deep inside planets., Solar flares accelerate both ions and electrons, and the energy content in accelerated ions may be comparable to that in accelerated electrons. The signature of ion acceleration is the emission of gamma-ray lines that result from nuclear interactions in the ambient solar atmosphere, and the gamma-ray line most easily observed by the high-resolution detectors on the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager ( RHESSI) is the 2.223~MeV neutron-capture line. Unfortunately, gamma-ray lines are often too weak to observe in all but the largest flares, but it is of interest to be able to put constraints on ion acceleration in the more frequently occurring smaller flares. We combine the spectra of many small flares to obtain limits on the average neutron-capture line flux for small flares and discuss the implications of these limits relative to previous studies of larger flares. The work at the University of California, Berkeley, was supported by NASA contract NAS 5-98033., On June 3, 2007 the five THEMIS spacecraft traversed the dayside post-noon magnetosphere like pearls on a string in a near-equatorial orbit with a 15.4 RE apogee. The leading (probe B) and trailing (probe A) spacecraft were separated by ~~3 RE. While THEMIS B monitored the magnetosheath THEMIS A, C, D, and E were still located inside the magnetosphere and observed an extended layer of mixed cold magnetosheath and hot plasma sheet plasmas. The plasma temperature and density were intermediate between the magnetosheath and hot plasma sheet values. The electron pitch angle distributions in this cold and dense plasma sheet (CDPS) display perfectly balanced field-aligned counter-streaming electrons at all energies, indicating that this region is located on closed magnetic field lines. The CDPS was observed sequentially by the four THEMIS spacecraft, which allows the determination of the thickness and spatial evolution of this region. The dayside post-noon magnetopause appeared to be a stable boundary during this interval, with no evidence for Kelvin-Helmholtz waves. During the same interval Geotail observed CDPS in the dawn flank magnetotail, indicating that the magnetosheath plasma penetration was a global phenomenon. The CDPS observations were associated with an interval of equal northward and dawnward IMF. These observations may suggest that the capturing of the magnetosheath plasma by double-cusp reconnection occurs even with a significant IMF By component., In this study we present results of electric and magnetic field fluctuation spectras in 14 intervals observed in the ambient solar wind near 1 AU, using electric- and magnetic field and plasma measurements from Cluster and ACE spacecrafts. The main focus is particularly on the energy transfer in the small scales (k ρ &gt; 1), usually referred as ""dissipation range"" in literature. It is however likely that it is a second inertial range caused by the change in the dispersion relation as energy cascades to smaller wavelengths from Alfven waves in some nonlinear process and heats the surrounding plasma. In the inertial range electric and magnetic fluctuation spectras follow the classical fluid-like Kolmogorov behavior as is previously observed. The fluid-like behavior breaks down near the ion thermal gyro-radius ( ρi) and we observe an enhancement in the electric spectrum while the magnetic spectrum becomes steeper. Special interest is paid to the in-situ measurements of the phase speed (vphi(k ρi)) of the turbulent plasma and comparison of the approximated dispersion of the waves to the theoretical predictions, goal being to find out the nature of the observed waves in the ""dissipation range""., Using global auroral images from Polar UVI in the southern hemisphere and IMAGE FUV in the north, we have analyzed the conjugacy of the afternoon aurora over a five-month period. From over 50 concurrent intervals we observe several asymmetries, periods for which auroral structure at one pole diverges from the other. Initial results suggest that this is due to the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and the solar wind velocity. Should the velocity fall below a certain threshold (~ 500 km/s), any fluctuation or discontinuity in the IMF appears to have no affect on auroral activity. Above this threshold, however, when the IMF is southward and a significant dawnward component exists, there is an enhancement in the afternoon aurora in the northern hemisphere. If, on the other hand, there is a significant duskward component to the IMF, then an enhancement in the afternoon aurora in the southern hemisphere is observed. The results of this study indicate that these features are driven by an instability at the magnetopause (such as a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability). In addition, these findings show that the dayside magnetosphere can respond asymmetrically to discontinuities in the IMF., This thesis quantitatively investigates the large-scale distribution and kinematics of gas in the Milky Way and other galaxies. Using the Leiden/ Argentine/Bonn (LAB) survey, I map the vertical structure of the Milky Way in atomic hydrogen. I reduce the complex structure of the warp to three simple Fourier spatial frequencies, and I show that the vertical oscillations known as ""scalloping"" are local rather than global. I then use unsharp masking to produce perturbed surface density and thickness maps of the outer Milky Way disk. These maps show the presence of spiral arms out to at least 25 kpc from the Galactic center, and demonstrate that overdensities in the surface density are coincident with regions of reduced gas thickness. Using interferometric observations from the VLA Galactic Plane Survey (VGPS) and the Southern Galactic Plane Survey (SGPS), I constrain the rotation curve of the inner Galaxy and its first two vertical derivatives. I use global and local models to find the falloff in the rotation curve from the plane is -22 ± 6 km s -1 kpc - 1 . This result is consistent with the falloff measured in the halos of other galaxies, but is too large to be explained by gravitational physics alone. I also present new observations of dense gas tracers in the central kiloparsec of NGC 6946 made with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA). These observations spatially resolve the emission from HCN and HCO+ . I discuss two plausible hypotheses for the distribution of the dense gas., The origin and distribution of r-process elements in the Milky Way are poorly understood. To unravel the chemical evolution history of the Galaxy, we are working to measure the abundances of europium and other r-process elements in solar-metallicty Galactic thin disk stars. With nearly one thousand S/N 100 Keck I HIRES spectra of stars with 0.5 &lt; B-V &lt; 1.5 and -0.5 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; 0.5, we expect to place strong constraints on the origin of the r-process, both in spatial distribution and through the Galaxy's history. We present here progress to date in an ongoing abundance analysis of europium in nearby (d &lt; 100 pc) F, G, and K stars, abundances determined with an LTE spectral synthesis code. We include for comparison our fit to the Eu lines in the sun and in a handful of stars that have been previously measured in literature abundance work. Our europium abundances lay the foundation for future investigation of lines from other elements, like the pure r-process element thorium. With these techniques in hand, we hope to establish an r-process abundance pattern derived from hundreds of solar-type stars, and use relative abundances of r-process and s-process elements to gain insight into the history of heavy-element nucleosynthesis in the solar neighborhood. <P />This work has been supported by a NASA grant managed by the University of California at Berkeley., We report on a statistical analysis of the measured electron temperature anisotropy in the solar wind using the 3DP instrument on the Wind spacecraft. Approximately one million independent measurements of the electron velocity distribution were integrated in two energy ranges corresponding to the solar wind 'core' and 'halo' components. The parallel and perpendicular (to the local magnetic field) temperatures were computed from the pressure integral and compared with the parallel electron beta parameter βe, allel and the electron 'collisional age' Ae,e. The low-energy core distribution remains relatively isotropic, due to its larger density and correspondingly large Coulomb collision frequency. However, the temperature anisotropy of the halo distribution (E ≥ ~80 eV) shows a striking signature which suggests that it is bounded by a whistler-mode instability from above (T\perp/Tallel &gt; 1) and the electron firehose instability from below (T\perp/Tallel &lt; 1). These results confirm that solar wind electron expansion and compression are limited fundamentally by these instabilities., Direct observations or deduced analysis indicate clearly that formation of intense fluxes of relativistic electrons is an important ingredient in the evolution of numerous active magnetized plasma systems. Examples of relativistic electron energization include the recovery phase of a planetary magnetic storm, post solar flare coronal activity and the afterglow of gamma ray bursts. It is suggested that there exists a universal mechanism, which may explain electron energization at the vastly different magnetized plasma environments. The favorite configuration consists of an inhomogeneous magnetic field anchored at a given magnetic structure and excitation of whistler waves due to external injection of low-energy non-isotropic electrons. The energization proceeds as a bootstrap process due to interaction with the propagating whistler waves along the inhomogeneous magnetic field., The Sun is the most powerful particle accelerator in the solar system, accelerating ions up to tens of GeV and electrons to hundreds of MeV in solar flares and in coronal mass ejections. Solar flares are the most powerful explosions, releasing up to 10 32 -10 33 erg in 10 2 -10 3 seconds. How the Sun releases this energy and how it rapidly accelerates electrons and ions with high efficiency, and to such high energies, is still not understood. The process of particle acceleration in magnetized plasmas are thought to occur throughout the universe from Earth's magnetosphere to active galactic nuclei and supernova shocks. The Sun is a unique laboratory for studying these processes. Its proximity allows us to observe it with unparalleled sensitivity and spatial resolution and energetic particles can be sampled directly at Earth after escaping the Sun. The Sun can provide the key to understanding acceleration processes and energy release occurring on cosmic scales. <P />In this thesis, we consider weak hard X-ray (HXR) bursts. In chapter 1, an introduction to the subject of solar observations is presented. Chapter 2 introduces the theory of Coulomb interactions whose understanding is necessary to the quantitative analysis of HXRs. In Chapter 3, the main instrument used in this study is described, the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Spectroscopic Solar Imager (RHESSI). A statistical analysis of the largest sample of RHESSI microflares is presented in Chapter 4. RHESSI microflares are found to be similar to large flares and not important to coronal heating. In Chapter 5, a series of HXR bursts associated with Type III radio bursts are analyzed. It is found that they are a signature of the acceleration process. In Chapter 6, we introduce HXR focusing optics and a new instrument, FOXSI, short for the Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager. With its large sensitivity and dynamic range, FOXSI will directly image energetic electron beams as they are accelerated and travel through the corona. FOXSI will be a pathfinder for the next generation of solar HXR observatories., STEREO's IMPACT (In-situ Measurements of Particles and CME Transients) investigation provides the first opportunity for long duration, detailed observations of 1 AU magnetic field structures, plasma and suprathermal electrons, and energetic particles at points bracketing Earth's heliospheric location. The IMPACT team has developed both human-friendly web portals and API's (application program interfaces) which provide straight- foward data access to scientists and the Virtual Observatories. A new web browser tool provides easy access to imaging data related to events measured in-situ, and the Virtual Heliospheric Observatory incorporates STEREO data into its data system providing another powerful venue for multi-point, multi-spacecraft analysis of the heliosphere. This variety of data access techniques and the development of cross-spacecraft data analysis tools allow the larger scientific community to combine STEREO's unique in-situ data with those of other missions and, therefore, to maximize STEREO's scientific potential in gaining a greater understanding of the heliosphere., The first biggest CME in the Stereo era, which occurred on 13 December 2006, is studied in terms of its solar source and heliospheric consequences. The CME appears as a halo event in LASCO coronagraph images and hits the Stereo and ACE spacecraft as a magnetic cloud (MC) preceded by a shock; the shock is also observed at Ulysses which is more than 100 degrees apart from the 1 AU spacecraft in heliocentric longitude, indicative of a large longitudinal extent of the shock. The interplanetary structure of the CME is reconstructed using the Grad- Shafranov technique combined with a minimum variance analysis in an effort to connect with the solar source. Particle acceleration, radio wave emissions and plasma instabilities associated with the shock are investigated by examining the shock geometry and magnetic fluctuations in the sheath region of the MC. We also propagate the in situ measurements at 1 AU to the outer heliosphere using an MHD model in order to compare with Ulysses observations and assess the consequences at large distances., Recent studies of solar wind turbulence suggest that tangential discontinuities in the interplanetary medium can introduce significant intermittency and these discontinuities may be a natural manifestation of flux-tube-like structures in the solar wind. Because the existence of these flux tubes can affect our understanding of the solar wind MHD turbulence, it is necessary that we verify their existence and are able to identify them individually. Using the magnetic field data from FGM instrument onboard Cluster spacecraft, we examine the existence of flux tubes in the solar wind. Cluster/FGM has a high time resolution of magnetic field data and the orbits of Cluster also traverse through various dynamic regions, including the solar wind, Earth's magnetosheath and magnetotail, making Cluster's dataset ideal for studying the differences between, for example, solar wind turbulence and those inside the magnetosphere (e.g. turbulence in plasma sheet). Using a recent data analysis by Li, [2007a,b], we show that flux tubes exist in the solar wind, but not inside Earth's magnetotial. The existence of flux-tube-like structures in the solar wind implies that current studies of solar wind MHD turbulence must be carefully re-examined because these flux tubes will inneviatablly cause intermittency and affect turbulence power spectrum., We report observational evidence for an elongated electron reconnection diffusion region during fast reconnection. The Cluster in-situ observations in a magnetosheath reconnecting current sheet reveal a broad current layer (width around 12 ion skin depths) supporting the reversal of the reconnecting magnetic field with an embedded intense outflow current that implies a super-Alfvenic electron outflow jet with a transverse scale of ~8 electron skin depths. The oblique trajectory of the spacecraft through the reconnection layer allows the deduction of a fast reconnection rate of 9% of the upstream Alfven speed as well as the minimum extent of the super-Alfvenic electron outflow jet of 50 ion skin depths downstream from the X-line. The deduced reconnection rate is consistent with the directly measured rate of 8% based on the tangential electric field and the inflow plasma velocity. These observations confirm and extend the surprising finding from recent large-scale full particle simulations of the presence of an elongated (&gt; 20 ion skin depths) electron diffusion region even during fast reconnection [Shay et al., 2007; Karimabadi et al., 2007]., We investigate the rupture process of a sequence of repeating Mw 2.1 earthquakes on the San Andreas Fault in Parkfield spanning the occurrence of the September 28, 2004 mainshock by inverting seismic moment rate functions obtained from empirical Green's function deconvolution. The results show that these events have extremely concentrated slip patches with radii on the order of 10-20 m, with peak slip between 8.4 and 11.4 cm. The rupture speed and rise time are consistent with values of larger earthquakes. The spatial distribution of stress drop for the events shows low average values 2.5-5.6 MPa and very large peak values of 66.7-93.9 MPa. The results show that strong asperities can exist at small scales on an otherwise weak fault, and helps reconcile differences between traditional spectra-based and tectonic loading methods for determining the stress drop of small repeating earthquakes., Asymmetries and motions in the dust shell surrounding Mira A (ο Ceti) are reported. Measurements were taken with the UC Berkeley Infrared Spatial Interferometer (ISI), a three-element interferometer operating at 11.15 μm. At the time of these observations, it was in a linear, east-west configuration with a maximum baseline of 12 m and thus had a resolution of better than 100 mas. Three years of data (2003-2005) are presented and permit observation of the movement of dust shells over time. Fits are made to the visibility and closure-phase curves, which are then used to create one-dimensional profiles of the dust shells. Asymmetries in the circumstellar dust have been observed, and several possible explanations for these asymmetries are explored., We present a catalog of 59 z~4.5 Lyα-emitting galaxies spectroscopically confirmed in a campaign of Keck DEIMOS follow-up observations to candidates selected in the Large Area Lyα (LALA) narrowband imaging survey. We targeted 97 candidates for spectroscopic follow-up by accounting for the variety of conditions under which we performed spectroscopy, we estimate a selection reliability of ~76%. Together with our previous sample of Keck LRIS confirmations, the 59 sources confirmed herein bring the total catalog to 73 spectroscopically confirmed z~4.5 Lyα-emitting galaxies in the ~0.7 deg<SUP>2</SUP> covered by the LALA imaging. As with the Keck LRIS sample, we find that a nonnegligible fraction of the confirmed Lyα lines have rest-frame equivalent widths (W<SUP>rest</SUP><SUB>λ</SUB>) that exceed the maximum predicted for normal stellar populations: 17%-31% (93% confidence) of the detected galaxies show W<SUP>rest</SUP><SUB>λ</SUB>&gt;190 Å, and 12%-27% (90% confidence) show W<SUP>rest</SUP><SUB>λ</SUB>&gt;240 Å. We construct a luminosity function of z~4.5 Lyα emission lines for comparison to Lyα luminosity functions spanning 3.1&lt;z&lt;6.6. We find no significant evidence for Lyα luminosity function evolution from z~3 to z~6. This result supports the conclusion that the intergalactic medium remains largely reionized from the local universe out to z~6.5. It is somewhat at odds with the pronounced drop in the cosmic star formation rate density recently measured between z~3 and z~6 in continuum-selected Lyman-break galaxies, and therefore potentially sheds light on the relationship between the two populations. <P />Based in part on observations made at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation. <P />Our data were obtained using community access telescope time made available under the National Science Foundation's Telescope System Instrumentation Program (TSIP), awarded by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory., I will address the temporal behavior of magnetic reconnection at the low- and high-latitude magnetopause. Evidences for both continuous and intermittent reconnection at the magnetopause and their ionospheric signatures have been reported in the literature. Repeated detections of reconnection flows by multi-spacecraft during multiple magnetopause crossings, as well as the continuous observations of the proton aurora, have been taken as evidence for continuous reconnection. On the other hand, flux transfer events (FTEs) and their ionospheric signatures have often been interpreted as evidence for intermittent reconnection. One of the key questions is whether reconnection is dominantly continuous or intermittent during steady IMF conditions. I will discuss the possibility that some of the FTE signatures are caused not by intermittent reconnection, but by continuous reconnection with modulated reconnection rates instead., We calculate Faraday rotation in global axisymmetric MHD simulations of geometrically thick accretion flows. These calculations are motivated by the measured rotation measure (RM)~-6×10<SUP>5</SUP> rad m<SUP>-2</SUP> from Sgr A* in the Galactic center, which appears to have been stable over the past ~7 yr. In our numerical simulations, the quasi-steady state structure of the accretion flow, as well as the RM it produces, depends on the initial magnetic field threading the accreting material. In spite of this dependence, we can draw several robust conclusions about Faraday rotation produced by geometrically thick accretion disks: (1) the time-averaged RM does not depend that sensitively on the viewing angle through the accretion flow, but the stability of the RM can. Equatorial viewing angles show significant variability in RM (including sign reversals), while polar viewing angles are relatively stable if there is a large-scale magnetic field threading the disk at large radii. (2) Most of the RM is produced at small radii for polar viewing angles, while all radii contribute significantly near the midplane of the disk. Our simulations confirm previous analytic arguments that the accretion rate onto Sgr A* must satisfy M˙<SUB>in</SUB>&lt;&lt;M˙<SUB>Bondi</SUB>~10<SUP>-5</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> in order to not overproduce the measured RM. We argue that the steady RM~-6×10<SUP>5</SUP> rad m<SUP>-2</SUP> from Sgr A* has two plausible explanations: (1) It is produced at ~100 Schwarzschild radii, requires M˙<SUB>in</SUB>~3×10<SUP>-8</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, and we view the flow at an angle of ~30° relative to the rotation axis of the disk. (2) Alternatively, the RM may be produced in the relatively spherical inflowing plasma near the circularization radius at ~10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> Schwarzschild radii. Time variability studies of the RM can distinguish between these two possibilities., Using the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard the Hubble Space Telescope, we have discovered dust-scattered light from the debris disk surrounding the F2 V star HD 15745. The circumstellar disk is detected between 2.0"" and 7.5"" radius, corresponding to 128-480 AU radius. The circumstellar disk morphology is asymmetric about the star, resembling a fan, and consistent with forward scattering grains in an optically thin disk with an inclination of ~67° to our line of sight. The spectral energy distribution and scattered light morphology can be approximated with a model disk composed of silicate grains between 60 and 450 AU radius, with a total dust mass of 10<SUP>-7 </SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> (0.03 M<SUB>⊕</SUB>), representing a narrow grain size distribution (1-10 μm). Galactic space motions are similar to the Castor moving group, with an age of ~10<SUP>8</SUP> yr, although future work is required to determine the age of HD 15745 using other indicators., We present a characterization of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars in the Spitzer Space Telescope's InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) photometric system. We confirm that stars with higher mass loss rates are redder in colors involving the 8.0 micron band while colors computed with other bands are strongly influenced by photospheric dust and molecular features. We find that carbon and S-type stars are generally more luminous than the O-rich stars, in agreement with their expected mass class. The period of AGB stars of Mira or semiregular variability type is only loosely correlated with the luminosity of the star --- stars with longer period tend to have higher luminosity. We do, however, find a tight period-color relation for the semiregular variables, which is not observed in Miras. This suggests that semiregular variables lack hot dust responsible for the infrared excess in the IRAC bands for the Miras. This is perhaps due to a discontinuous mass loss process for semiregulars as proposed in Marengo et al. (2001), in contrast to the continuous mass loss rates observed in Miras. <P />Support for this work was provided by NASA through an award issued by JPL/Caltech, and by the National Science Foundation's Research Experience for Undergraduates Program., Cycloids are made up of linked arcuate segments and were observed in both Voyager and Galileo imagery. It has been proposed that cycloids are fractures that propagate in response to the tidal stress field, which changes throughout each orbit due to Europa's eccentricity. Several studies have tested tidal models by generating cycloidal features and comparing them to actual cycloids, resulting in compelling evidence for non-synchronous rotation. Also, recent modeling of cycloids in equatorial regions has shown that the obliquity of Europa is large enough to affect the formation of surface features. In addition to constraining the orbital and rotational parameters that control Europa's tidal stress field, modeling of cycloidal fractures can provide constraints on the mechanical properties of the ice shell. Despite the successes of cycloid modeling, the methodology for generating cycloids and comparing them with actual data could be greatly improved and more widely applied. Only five cycloids have been modeled although dozens of global-scale features can be identified in the Galileo images. And although equatorial cycloids provide the best constraints on the amount of obliquity and direction of the spin pole, only one cycloid in this region has been successfully modeled, mostly due to the increased parameter space and lack of symmetry in the stress field. Searching for best fits by hand is no longer feasible, especially for the large number of cycloids needed to precisely constrain Europa's orbital and rotational parameters. In addition, past cycloid modeling has not relied on a quantitative measure of goodness of fit when matching hypothetical cycloids to the observed features. While this approach may have been satisfactory for early work, as fits improve, it becomes increasingly important to have a consistent and quantitative measure with which to evaluate modeled cycloids. Moreover, a quantitative measure of misfit can be translated into uncertainties for model parameters. We are currently developing a new method of cycloid modeling that combines the standard tidal model (including obliquity) with an automated and quantitative fitting program and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to search the parameter space. Our preliminary work has shown that this method is effective when applied to a synthetic crack; the algorithm does indeed ""find"" the parameters with which the crack was generated. Our ongoing work involves mapping and modeling large-scale equatorial cycloids, using this upgraded method, in order to constrain the amount of obliquity, direction of the spin pole, non-synchronous rotation rate, and amount of stress generated by non-synchronous rotation., That microbial siderophores may be mediators of Mn(III) biogeochemistry is suggested by recent studies showing that these well known Fe(III)-chelating ligands form very stable Mn(III) aqueous complexes. In this study, we examine the influence of desferrioxamine B (DFOB), a trihydroxamate siderophore, on the dissolution of hausmannite, a mixed valence Mn(II, III) oxide found in soils and freshwater sediments. Batch dissolution experiments were conducted both in the absence (pH 4-9) and in the presence of 100 μM DFOB (pH 5-9). In the absence of the ligand, there is a sharp decrease in the extent of proton-promoted dissolution above pH 5 and no appreciable dissolution above pH 8. The resulting aqueous Mn <SUP>2+</SUP> activities were in good agreement with previous studies, indirectly supporting the accepted two-step mechanism involving the formation of manganite and reprecipitation of hausmannite. Desferrioxamine B enhanced hausmannite dissolution over the entire pH range investigated, both via the formation of a Mn(III) complex and through surface-catalyzed reductive dissolution. Above pH 8, non-reductive ligand-promoted dissolution dominated, whereas below pH 8, dissolution was non-stoichiometric with respect to DFOB. Concurrent proton-promoted, ligand-promoted, reductive, and induced dissolution was observed, with Mn release by either reductive or induced dissolution increasing linearly with decreasing pH. The fast kinetics of the DFOB-promoted dissolution of hausmannite, as compared to iron oxides, suggest that the siderophore-promoted dissolution of Mn(III)-bearing minerals may compete with the siderophore-promoted dissolution of Fe(III)-bearing minerals., This Letter presents X-ray observations of a partially limb-occulted solar flare taken by the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager and the X-ray telescope on board Hinode. Thermal emission originates from a simple loop at the western limb that rises slowly (~7 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) until the flare peak time. Above 18 keV, faint nonthermal emission with a hard/flat spectrum (γ~4) and fast time variations (of the order of tens of seconds) is seen that comes from a loop slightly above (~2000 km) the thermal loop, if compared at the same time. However, the nonthermal loop agrees well in altitude with the thermal flare loop seen later, at the soft X-ray peak time. This is consistent with simple flare models where nonthermal electrons in a flare loop produce thin-target hard X-ray emission in the corona as they travel to the loop footpoints. There they lose all their energy and heat chromospheric plasma that fills the loop earlier seen in nonthermal hard X-rays. This suggests that electron acceleration in solar flares occurs in the corona., The WIYN Open Cluster Study (WOCS) is a project dedicated to the comprehensive study of photometric, astrometric, and spectroscopic properties of open star clusters. This REU project studies open cluster NGC 2420 in order to refine the measured values of its astrophysical properties. Observations were made in the UBVRI filters with the WIYN 0.9m telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory. We performed PSF photometry using Daophot II, allowing for spatially-dependent PSFs and aperture corrections. Color-color diagrams were used to determine the reddening and metallicity of NGC 2420, and the theoretical Yale-Yonsei Isochrones were used to establish the distance and age of the cluster. We find E(B-V) = 0.07 ± &lt;0.01 ± sys, [Fe/H] = -0.16 ± 0.05 ± sys, (m-M)<SUB>0</SUB> = 12.38 ± &lt;0.05 ± sys (= 2.708 ± &lt;0.062 ± sys kpc), and age = 1.79 ± 0.05 ± sys Gyr. This work has been supported by the National Science Foundation under grant AST-0452975., B-band light-curve rise times for eight unusually well-observed nearby Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are fitted by a newly developed template-building algorithm, using light-curve functions that are smooth, flexible, and free of potential bias from externally derived templates and other prior assumptions. From the available literature, photometric BVRI data collected over many months, including the earliest points, are reconciled, combined, and fitted to a unique time of explosion for each SN. On average, after they are corrected for light-curve decline rate, three SNe rise in 18.81+/-0.36 days, while five SNe rise in 16.64+/-0.21 days. If all eight SNe are sampled from a single parent population (a hypothesis not favored by statistical tests), the rms intrinsic scatter of the decline rate-corrected SN rise time is 0.96<SUP>+0.52</SUP><SUB>-0.25</SUB> days, a first measurement of this dispersion. The corresponding global mean rise time is 17.44+/-0.39 days, where the uncertainty is dominated by intrinsic variance. This value is ~2 days shorter than two published averages that nominally are twice as precise, although also based on small samples. When comparing high-z to low-z SN luminosities for determining cosmological parameters, bias can be introduced by use of a light-curve template with an unrealistic rise time. If the period over which light curves are sampled depends on z in a manner typical of current search and measurement strategies, a 2 day discrepancy in template rise time can bias the luminosity comparison by ~0.03 mag., Over the last 15 to 20 years several high quality, high resolution data have been taken with the very large array (VLA). These data exhibit a wide range of ring opening angles ( |B|=0 to 26°) and wavelengths ( λ=0.7 to 20 cm). At these wavelengths the primary flux from the rings is scattered saturnian thermal emission, with a small contribution coming from the ring particles' own thermal emission. Much of the data do show signs of asymmetries due to wakes either on the ansae or the portion of the rings which occult the planet. As in previous work, we use our Monte Carlo radiative transfer code including idealized wakes [Dunn, D.E., Molnar, L.A., Fix, J.D., 2002. Icarus 160, 132-160; Dunn, D.E., Molnar, L.A., Niehof, J.T., de Pater, I., Lissauer, J.L., 2004. Icarus 171, 183-198] to model the relative contributions of the scattered and thermal radiation emanating from the rings and compare the results to that seen in the data. Although the models do give satisfactory fits to all of our data, we find that no single model can simulate the data at all different |B| and λ. We find that one model works best for moderate and low |B| and another one at higher |B|. The main difference between these models is the ratio of the wake width to their separation. We similarly find that the 2 cm data require higher density wakes than the longer wavelength data, perhaps caused by a preponderance of somewhat smaller ring material in the wakes. We further find evidence for an increase in the physical temperature of the rings with increasing |B|. Continuous observations are required to determine whether the above results regarding variations in wake parameters with |B| and λ are indeed caused by these parameters, or instead by changes over time., Individual BVRI light-curve templates have been determined for 22 unusually well-observed literature Type Ia supernovae by the newly developed template builder AQUAA. This tool uses light-curve functions that are smooth, flexible, and free of potential bias from externally derived templates and other prior assumptions. In the B filter, to high accuracy 19 of these light curves may be represented by a single master template that is stretched adaptively along the time axis. The usual parameter describing average linear stretch is supplemented by two new nonlinear parameters that characterize transitions between regions of different time dilation. The distribution of these parameter values is related to the observed diversity of supernova rise times (Strovink, M., ApJ in press, astro-ph/07050726). Major portions of the VRI light curves, including the pre-maximum and peak regions, may be represented by corresponding master templates that similarly are stretched. When the dependence of absolute supernova luminosity on the limited number of stretch parameters is established, the use of Type Ia supernovae as cosmological distance indicators will be simplified and may be sharpened. <P />This work is supported by the Director, Office of Science, of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231., Recently, several methods that measure the velocity of magnetized plasma from time series of photospheric vector magnetograms have been developed. Velocity fields derived using such techniques can be used both to determine the fluxes of magnetic energy and helicity into the corona, which have important consequences for understanding solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and the solar dynamo, and to drive time-dependent numerical models of coronal magnetic fields. To date, these methods have not been rigorously tested against realistic, simulated data sets, in which the magnetic field evolution and velocities are known. Here we present the results of such tests using several velocity-inversion techniques applied to synthetic magnetogram data sets, generated from anelastic MHD simulations of the upper convection zone with the ANMHD code, in which the velocity field is fully known. Broadly speaking, the MEF, DAVE, FLCT, IM, and ILCT algorithms performed comparably in many categories. While DAVE estimated the magnitude and direction of velocities slightly more accurately than the other methods, MEF's estimates of the fluxes of magnetic energy and helicity were far more accurate than any other method's. Overall, therefore, the MEF algorithm performed best in tests using the ANMHD data set. We note that ANMHD data simulate fully relaxed convection in a high-β plasma, and therefore do not realistically model photospheric evolution., A single parameter, the gravitational growth index γ, succeeds in characterizing the growth of density perturbations in the linear regime separately from the effects of the cosmic expansion. The parameter is restricted to a very narrow range for models of dark energy obeying the laws of general relativity but can take on distinctly different values in models of beyond-Einstein gravity. Motivated by the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism for testing gravity, we analytically derive and extend the gravitational growth index, or minimal modified gravity, approach to parameterizing beyond-Einstein cosmology. The analytic formalism demonstrates how to apply the growth index parameter to early dark energy, time-varying gravity, DGP braneworld gravity, and some scalar-tensor gravity., We detected a volcanic outburst in Io's northern hemisphere on 17 April 2006 with the OSIRIS imaging spectrometer at Keck, and confirmed it was still erupting on 2 June 2006. The eruption, which we name 060417A, was located in Tvashtar Paterae, ∼100 km southeast of the February 2000 eruption. The observed temperature was 1240±4K, over a surface area of 60±5km, providing a total thermal output of 7.7±0.9×10W., Seismic wave propagation through the earth is often strongly affected by the presence of fractures. When these fractures are filled with fluids (oil, gas, water, CO<SUB>2</SUB>, etc.), the type and state of the fluid (liquid or gas) can make a large difference in the response of the seismic waves. This paper summarizes recent work on methods of deconstructing the effects of fractures, and any fluids within these fractures, on seismic wave propagation as observed in reflection seismic data. One method explored here is Thomsen's weak anisotropy approximation for wave moveout (since fractures often induce elastic anisotropy due to non-uniform crack-orientation statistics). Another method makes use of some very convenient crack/fracture parameters introduced previously that permit a relatively simple deconstruction of the elastic and wave propagation behaviour in terms of a small number of crack-influence parameters (whenever this is appropriate, as is certainly the case for small crack densities). Then, the quantitative effects of fluids on these crack-influence parameters are shown to be directly related to Skempton's coefficient B of undrained poroelasticity (where B typically ranges from 0 to 1). In particular, the rigorous result obtained for the low crack density limit is that the crack-influence parameters are multiplied by a factor (1 - B) for undrained systems. It is also shown how fracture anisotropy affects Rayleigh wave speed, and how measured Rayleigh wave speeds can be used to infer shear wave speed of the fractured medium in some cases. Higher crack density results are also presented by incorporating recent simulation data on such cracked systems., The Far-Ultraviolet Imager (IMAGE-FUV) on board the NASA IMAGE satellite has been used to observe plasma depletions in the nightside equatorial ionosphere. Observations from periods around spacecraft apogee, during which equatorial regions are visible for several hours, have allowed the velocity of these plasma depletions to be determined. A new method for determining the velocity of these depletions using an image analysis technique, Tracking Of Airglow Depletions (TOAD), has been developed. TOAD allows the objective identification and tracking of depletions. The automation of this process has also allowed for the tracking of a greater number of depletions than previously achieved without requiring any human input, which shows that TOAD is suitable for use with large data sets and for future routine monitoring of the ionosphere from space. Furthermore, this automation allows the drift velocities of each bubble to be determined as a function of magnetic latitude, which will give us the capability of retrieving geophysically important parameters such as the electric field, which are believed to vary rapidly with magnetic latitude., One of the largest solar hard X-ray (HXR) flares and solar energetic particle (SEP) events recorded by the Mars Odyssey mission while orbiting Mars occurred on 2002 October 27 and is related to a very fast (~2300 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) coronal mass ejection (CME). From the Earth, the flare site is 40.4° +/- 3.5° behind the solar limb and only emissions from the high corona at least 1.5 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> km radially above the main flare site can be seen. Nevertheless, the Earth-orbiting Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) observed HXR emission up to 60 keV with a relatively flat, nonthermal spectrum (γ between 3 and 3.5) that has an onset simultaneous with the main HXR emission observed above 60 keV by the Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (GRS) orbiting Mars. While GRS records several smaller enhancements after the main peak, the high coronal source observed by RHESSI shows a long exponential decay (τ = 135 +/- 5 s) with progressive spectral hardening. The emissions from the high corona originate from an extended source (~1.5 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> km in diameter) that expands (390 +/- 70 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) and moves upwards (750 +/- 80 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) in the same direction as the CME. These observations reveal the existence of energetic electrons in the high corona in closed magnetic structures related to the CME that are accelerated at the same time as the main energy release in the flare. Although the number of energetic electrons in the high corona is only a small fraction of the total accelerated electrons, about 10% of all electrons in the high coronal source are nonthermal (&gt;10 keV)., We compare Hα, radio continuum, and Spitzer Space Telescope images of 58 planetary nebulae (PNe) recently discovered by the Macquarie-AAO-Strasbourg Hα PN Project (MASH) of the SuperCOSMOS Hα Survey. Using Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) data, we examine the relationships between optical and MIR morphologies from 3.6 to 8.0 μm and explore the ratio of mid-infrared (MIR) to radio nebular fluxes, which is a valuable discriminant between thermal and nonthermal emission. MASH emphasizes late evolutionary stages of PNe compared with previous catalogs, enabling study of the changes in MIR and radio flux that attend the aging process. Spatially integrated fluxes are constructed for all MASH PNe observed by the GLIMPSE Legacy Project, using the Hα morphologies to define the areas of MIR and radio continuum emission observed by the Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX), IRAC, the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope, and the Very Large Array (VLA). The ratio of IRAC 8.0 μm to MSX 8.3 μm fluxes provides an assessment of the absolute diffuse calibration of IRAC at 8.0 μm. We independently confirm the aperture correction factor to be applied to IRAC at 8.0 μm to align it with the diffuse calibration of MSX. The result is in accord with the recommendations of the Spitzer Science Center and with our results from a parallel study of H II regions in the MIR and radio. However, these PNe probe the diffuse calibration of IRAC on a spatial scale of 9<SUP>''</SUP>-77<SUP>''</SUP>, as opposed to the many-arcminute scale from the H II regions' study., Precipitation is expected in Titan's atmosphere, yet it has not been directly observed, and the geographical regions where rain occurs are unknown. Here we present near-infrared spectra from the Very Large Telescope and W. M. Keck Observatories that reveal an enhancement of opacity in Titan's troposphere on the morning side of the leading hemisphere. Retrieved extinction profiles are consistent with condensed methane in clouds at an altitude near 30 kilometers and concomitant methane drizzle below. The moisture encompasses the equatorial region over Titan's brightest continent, Xanadu. Diurnal temperature gradients that cause variations in methane relative humidity, winds, and topography may each be a contributing factor to the condensation mechanism. The clouds and precipitation are optically thin at 2.0 micrometers, and models of “subvisible” clouds suggest that the droplets are 0.1 millimeter or larger., , We classify 329 late-type giants within 1 pc of Sgr A*, using the adaptive optics integral field spectrometer SINFONI on the VLT. These observations represent the deepest spectroscopic data set so far obtained for the Galactic center, reaching a 50% completeness threshold at the approximate magnitude of the helium-burning red clump (K<SUB>S</SUB>~15.5 mag). Combining our spectroscopic results with NaCo H and K<SUB>S</SUB> photometry, we construct an observed Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, which we quantitatively compare to theoretical distributions of various star formation histories of the inner Galaxy, using a χ<SUP>2</SUP> analysis. Our best-fit model corresponds to continuous star formation over the last 12 Gyr with a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF). The similarity of this IMF to the IMF observed for the most recent epoch of star formation is intriguing and perhaps suggests a connection between recent star formation and the stars formed throughout the history of the Galactic center., We have used the integral field spectrograph OSIRIS and laser guide star adaptive optics at Keck Observatory to obtain high angular resolution (0.06""), moderate spectral resolution (R~=3800) images of the bipolar jet from the Herbig Ae star LkHα 233, seen in near-IR [Fe II] emission at 1.600 and 1.644 μm. This jet is narrow and tightly collimated, with an opening angle of only 9°, and has an average radial velocity of ~100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The jet and counterjet are asymmetric, with the redshifted jet much clumpier than its counterpart at the angular resolution of our observations. The observed properties are in general similar to jets seen around T Tauri stars, although it has a relatively large mass flux of 1.2+/-0.3×10<SUP>-7</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, near the high end of the observed mass flux range around T Tauri stars. We also spatially resolve an inclined circumstellar disk around LkHα 233, which obscures the star from direct view. By comparison with numerical radiative transfer disk models, we estimate the disk midplane to be inclined i=65<SUP>deg</SUP>+/-5<SUP>deg</SUP> relative to the plane of the sky. Since the star is seen only in scattered light at near-infrared wavelengths, we detect only a small fraction of its intrinsic flux. Because previous estimates of its stellar properties did not account for this, either LkHa 233 must be located closer than previously believed, or its true luminosity must be greater than previously supposed, consistent with its being a ~4 M<SUB>solar</SUB> star near the stellar birth line. <P />Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation., We show that standard algorithms for anisotropic diffusion based on centered differencing (including the recent symmetric algorithm) do not preserve monotonicity. In the context of anisotropic thermal conduction, this can lead to the violation of the entropy constraints of the second law of thermodynamics, causing heat to flow from regions of lower temperature to higher temperature. In regions of large temperature variations, this can cause the temperature to become negative. Test cases to illustrate this for centered asymmetric and symmetric differencing are presented. Algorithms based on slope limiters, analogous to those used in second order schemes for hyperbolic equations, are proposed to fix these problems. While centered algorithms may be good for many cases, the main advantage of limited methods is that they are guaranteed to avoid negative temperature (which can cause numerical instabilities) in the presence of large temperature gradients. In particular, limited methods will be useful to simulate hot, dilute astrophysical plasmas where conduction is anisotropic and the temperature gradients are enormous, e.g., collisionless shocks and disk-corona interface., Dark energy models with non-canonical kinetic energy terms, k-essence, can have dynamical and sound speed properties distinct from canonical scalar fields, quintessence. Concentrating on purely kinetic term Lagrangians, which can be technically natural, we investigate limits on the equation of state dynamics and sound speed behaviors and the extent to which these models can be separated from quintessence., Debris disks around main-sequence stars are produced by the destruction of unseen parent bodies. AU Microscopii (GJ 803) is a compelling object to study in the context of disk evolution across different spectral types, as it is an M dwarf whose nearly edge-on disk may be directly compared to that of its A5 V sibling β Pic. We resolve the disk from 8-60 AU in the near-IR JHK' bands at high resolution with the Keck II Telescope and adaptive optics, and develop a data reduction technique for the removal of the stellar point-spread function. We measure a blue color across the near-IR bands, and confirm the presence of substructure in the inner disk. Some of the structural features exhibit wavelength-dependent positions. Recent measurements of the scattered-light polarization indicate the presence of porous grains. The scattering properties of these porous grains have a strong effect on the inferred structure of the disk relative to the majority of previously modeled grain types. Complementing prior work, we use a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code to compare a relatively simple model of the distribution of porous grains to a broad data set, simultaneously fitting midplane surface brightness profiles and the spectral energy distribution. Our model confirms that the large-scale architecture of the disk is consistent with detailed models of steady state grain dynamics. A belt of parent bodies from 35-40 AU produces dust that is then swept outward by stellar wind and radiation. We infer the presence of very small grains in the region exterior to the belt, down to sizes of ~0.05 μm. These sizes are consistent with stellar mass-loss rates M˙<SUB>*</SUB>&lt;&lt;10<SUP>2</SUP> M˙<SUB>solar</SUB>, We report precise Doppler measurements of GJ 317 (M3.5 V) that reveal the presence of a planet with a minimum mass M<SUB>P</SUB>sini=1.2 M<SUB>Jup</SUB> in an eccentric, 692.9 day orbit. GJ 317 is only the third M dwarf with a Doppler-detected Jovian planet. The residuals to a single-Keplerian fit show evidence of a possible second orbital companion. The inclusion of a second Jupiter-mass planet (P~2700 days, M<SUB>P</SUB>sini=0.83 M<SUB>Jup</SUB>) decreases sqrt(χ<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>ν</SUB>) from 2.02 to 1.23, and reduces the rms from 12.5 to 6.32 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>. A false-alarm test yields a 1.1% probability that the curvature in the residuals of the single-planet fit is due to random fluctuations, lending additional credibility to the two-planet model. However, our data only marginally constrain a two-planet fit, and further monitoring is necessary to fully characterize the properties of the second companion. To study the effect of stellar mass on giant planet occurrence, we measure the fraction of stars with planets in three mass bins comprised of our samples of M Dwarfs, solar-mass stars, and intermediate-mass subgiants. We find a positive correlation between stellar mass and the occurrence rate of Jovian planets within 2.5 AU. Low-mass K and M stars have a 1.8%+/-1.0% planet occurrence rate compared to 4.2%+/-0.7% for solar-mass stars and 8.9%+/-2.9% for the higher mass subgiants. This result indicates that the former F- and A-type stars with M<SUB>*</SUB>&gt;=1.3 M<SUB>solar</SUB> in our sample are nearly 5 times more likely than the M dwarfs to harbor a giant planet. Our analysis shows that the correlation between Jovian planet occurrence and stellar mass exists even after correcting for the effects of stellar metallicity. <P />Based on observations obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated jointly by the University of California and the California Institute of Technology. Keck time has been granted by both NASA and the University of California., Three-telescope interferometric observations from the Infrared Spatial Interferometer (ISI) are reported at spatial frequencies that resolve the size and shape of the star Betelgeuse (α Ori) at a wavelength of 11.15 μm with a bandwidth of 0.18 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. The data include closure phase measurements, the first such measurements of a stellar disk in the mid-infrared. The data indicate a clear asymmetry of the stellar surface at these wavelengths. Mechanisms for generating the observed asymmetry via an elliptical shape or a hot spot near the southern limb of the star are discussed., We report the detection of a ring of warm dust in the near-edge-on disk surrounding HD 32297 with the Gemini North Michelle mid-infrared imager. Our N'-band image shows elongated structure consistent with the orientation of the scattered-light disk. The F<SUB>ν</SUB>(11.2 μm)=49.9+/-2.1 mJy flux is significantly above the 28.2+/-0.6 mJy photosphere. Subtraction of the stellar point-spread function reveals a bilobed structure with peaks 0.5""-0.6"" from the star. The disk is detected out to the sensitivity limit at ~1"", and the flux in each lobe is symmetric to within 10%. An analysis of the stellar component of the spectral energy distribution (SED) suggests a spectral type later than A0, in contrast to commonly cited literature values. We fit three-dimensional, single-size grain models of an optically thin dust ring to our image and the SED using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm in a Bayesian framework. The best-fit effective grain sizes are submicron, suggesting the same dust population is responsible for the bulk of the scattered light. The inner boundary of the warm dust is located 0.5""-0.7"" (~65 AU) from the star, which is approximately cospatial with the outer boundary of the scattered-light asymmetry inward of 0.5"". The addition of a separate component of larger, cooler grains that provide a portion of the 60 μm flux improves both the fidelity of the model fit and consistency with the slopes of the scattered-light brightness profiles. The peak vertical optical depths in our models [~(0.3-1)×10<SUP>-2</SUP>] imply that grain-grain collisions likely play a significant role in dust dynamics and evolution. Submicron grains can survive radiation pressure blowout if they are icy and porous. Similarly, the inferred warm temperatures (130-200 K) suggest that ice sublimation may play a role in truncating the inner disk., We report observations of Io that were conducted on UT 12 November 2002 with the NIRSPEC spectrometer, coupled to the adaptive optics system, on the 10-m Keck II telescope. We detected a bright eruption in the Ra Patera area, with a color (H-K' band) temperature of 1031±110 K over an effective area of 1.5±0.2 km. The eruption was associated with a hot plume, which revealed itself through SO emission at a rate of (9±3)×10 photonss, about 10-15% of Io's total SO flux at the time. The rotational temperature was 700±150 K. No significant SO emission was received from Io's northern hemisphere (north of Ra Patera/Loki); roughly 50% of the total SO emission came from the equatorial region (including Ra Patera, Janus and Loki), and ∼40% came from the south. The rotational temperatures typically measured between 600 and 1000 K. The emissions are most likely produced by SO molecules ejected out of volcanic vents in the excited aΔ state. Our narrow band images that span the SO emission band suggest that a source near Io's south pole, Nemea, may be a source of some of the southern SO emissions., Local (shearing box) simulations of the nonlinear evolution of the magnetorotational instability in a collisionless plasma show that angular momentum transport by pressure anisotropy (p<SUB>⊥</SUB>≠p<SUB>∥</SUB>, where the directions are defined with respect to the local magnetic field) is comparable to that due to the Maxwell and Reynolds stresses. Pressure anisotropy, which is effectively a large-scale viscosity, arises because of adiabatic invariants related to p<SUB>⊥</SUB> and p<SUB>∥</SUB> in a fluctuating magnetic field. In a collisionless plasma, the magnitude of the pressure anisotropy, and thus the viscosity, is determined by kinetic instabilities at the cyclotron frequency. Our simulations show that ~50% of the gravitational potential energy is directly converted into heat at large scales by the viscous stress (the remaining energy is lost to grid-scale numerical dissipation of kinetic and magnetic energy). We show that electrons receive a significant fraction [~(T<SUB>e</SUB>/T<SUB>i</SUB>)<SUP>1/2</SUP>] of this dissipated energy. Employing this heating by an anisotropic viscous stress in one-dimensional models of radiatively inefficient accretion flows, we find that the radiative efficiency of the flow is greater than 0.5% for M˙&gt;~10<SUP>-4</SUP>M˙<SUB>Edd</SUB>. Thus, a low accretion rate, rather than just a low radiative efficiency, is necessary to explain the low luminosity of many accreting black holes. For Sgr A* in the Galactic center, our predicted radiative efficiencies imply an accretion rate of ~3×10<SUP>-8</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> and an electron temperature of ~3×10<SUP>10</SUP> K at ~10 Schwarzschild radii; the latter is consistent with the brightness temperature inferred from VLBI observations., We determine the parallax and proper motion of the flaring, nonthermal radio star GMR A, a member of the Orion Nebula Cluster, using Very Long Baseline Array observations. Based on the parallax, we measure a distance of 389<SUP>+24</SUP><SUB>-21</SUB> pc to the source. Our measurement places the Orion Nebula Cluster considerably closer than the canonical distance of 480+/-80 pc determined by Genzel et al. A change of this magnitude in distance lowers the luminosities of the stars in the cluster by a factor of ~1.5. We briefly discuss two effects of this change-an increase in the age spread of the pre-main-sequence stars, and better agreement between the zero-age main sequence and the temperatures and luminosities of massive stars., Solar wind-related electric fields are known to contribute to the loss of Venus atmosphere constituents, especially oxygen, by direct antisunward acceleration of planetary ions and possiblyby related dayside sputtering of neutrals. It has been suggested that these processes may have played a key role in Venus' atmosphere evolution. Most recently, evidence was found in PVO observations for enhancements of escaping ion fluxes during periods of disturbed interplanetary conditions, which may have been more prevalent in the early solar system. The ASPERA-4 Ion Mass Analyzer and Magnetometer on Venus Express have now made detailed measurements during several periods of exceptionally disturbed conditions created by coronal mass ejections. These new observations provide insights into the response of ion escape to this form of solar activity. We also describe nuances in in-situ studies of these effects, related to orbital sampling geometry, that were not fully appreciated prior to this analysis., Measurements and analysis of large-scale turbulent irregularities in the atmosphere are reported. Results were obtained from precision measurement of atmospheric temperature fluctuations at 24 and 70 feet above ground for a variety of wind velocities at the Mount Wilson Observatory. Measurements were made as wind blew air past detectors, at frequencies of 0.01-10 Hz, corresponding to distances in the atmosphere between about 1 and 250 m. Analysis shows that large-scale turbulences fit the Greenwood-Tarazano model well, and notably better than the von Karman model of turbulence., We begin by reviewing the theory of thermal, neutrino-driven proto-neutron star (PNS) winds. Including the effects of magnetic fields and rotation, we then derive the mass and energy loss from magnetically-driven PNS winds for both relativistic and non-relativistic outflows, including important multi-dimensional considerations. With these simple analytic scalings we argue that proto-magnetars born with ~ millisecond rotation periods produce relativistic winds just a few seconds after core collapse with luminosities, timescales, mass-loading, and internal shock efficiencies favorable for producing long-duration gamma-ray bursts., The space radiation environment near Mars has taken on new interest due to the resurrection of plans to send humans to explore the red planet. In addition, solar energetic particles represent a possibly significant input of energy to the atmosphere of Mars during major events, with consequences for atmospheric ionization, chemistry, and possibly escape. Measurements of solar events by the MARIE and GRS experiments on Mars Odyssey illustrate how Mars affects the low-Mars-orbit fluxes of these particles, apparently blocking some particles' access to the spacecraft. The extent to which the presence of Mars reduces the fluxes in Mars orbit from their interplanetary values, and the circumstances and geometry of those reductions, is examined using a simple model and some observationally inspired assumptions about the nature of solar energetic particle events. The results suggest how Mars orbiter SEP results can be interpreted, and also how near-Mars fluxes for a particular interplanetary event can be predicted., Before the launch of Chandra and XMM-Newton, only two type Ib/c supernovae had been observed in X-rays (1994I and 1998bw). I will review briefly the advances of the past seven years in the early (days to weeks) X-ray detection of type Ib/c supernovae, a recent effort to characterize the X-ray emission of years-old Ib/c supernovae (e.g., 2001em, 2003bg, 2004C, and 2006aj), and the results of an archival search for X-ray emission from all known type Ib/c supernovae which resulted in six (possibly seven) new detections., Reconnection occurs in a reconnection magnetic field geometry when there are positive electric field components tangential to the magnetopause and a magnetic field component normal to it. Because these three components are the smallest of the six electric and magnetic fields, their magnitudes are difficult to determine because of errors in, or oscillations of, the assumed constant direction normal to the current sheet. A method is described for minimizing these errors by appropriate selection of the normal direction and by analyzing the correlations between the large normal electric field and the large tangential magnetic field. The correlation coefficients are equal to ratios of the small fields, which are combined with the less accurate measurements of the averages of the small fields to produce best estimates of the small fields. For more than 120 magnetopause crossings, about 40% had such correlations that signify static conditions during those crossings. This method is applied to 22 polar subsolar magnetopause crossings to show that most were located in the ion diffusion region, as defined by the change of the total magnetic field, and that 14 had a large and steady reconnection rate with a zero parallel electric field. In these events the reconnection rate decreased with increasing guide magnetic field., The early, highly time-variable X-ray emission immediately following gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) exhibits strong spectral variations that are unlike the temporally smoother emission that dominates after t~10<SUP>3</SUP> s. The ratio of hard-channel (1.3-10.0 keV) to soft-channel (0.3-1.3 keV) counts in the Swift X-ray telescope provides a new measure delineating the end time of this emission. We define T<SUB>H</SUB> as the time at which this transition takes place and measure for 59 events a range of transition times that spans 10<SUP> 2</SUP> to 10<SUP>4</SUP> s, on average 5 times longer than the prompt T<SUB>90</SUB> duration observed in the gamma-ray band. It is very likely that the mysterious light-curve plateau phase and the later power-law temporal evolution, both of which typically occur at times greater than T<SUB>H</SUB> and hence exhibit very little hardness ratio evolution, are both produced by external shocking of the surrounding medium and not by the internal shocks thought responsible for the earlier emission. We use the apparent lack of spectral evolution to discriminate among proposed models for the plateau phase emission. We favor energy injection scenarios with a roughly linearly increasing input energy versus time for six well-sampled events with nearly flat light curves at t~10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> s. Also, using the transition time T<SUB>H</SUB> as the delineation between the GRB and afterglow emission, we calculate that the kinetic energy in the afterglow shock is typically a factor of 10 lower than that released in the GRB. Three very bright events suggest that this presents a missing X-ray flux problem rather than an efficiency problem for the conversion of kinetic energy into the GRB. Lack of hardness variations in these three events may be due to a very highly relativistic outflow or due to a very dense circumburst medium. There are a handful of rare cases of very late time t&gt;10<SUP>4</SUP> s hardness evolution, which may point to residual central engine activity at very late time., Long-duration GRBs and X-ray flashes (XRFs softer-spectrum brethren of long GRBs) are thought to occur following the core-collapse of massive stars. We report here on observations of a recent X-ray flash (XRF 060428B) that occurred 2.6<SUP>''</SUP> in projection from the center of a massive red galaxy at redshift z = 0.348, well within its detectable light. While initial probabilistic arguments suggested a physical connection, deep Keck imaging reveals a compact blue source at the burst position, likely a higher-redshift host galaxy. Since the observed offset is approximately equal to the Einstein radius of the foreground elliptical, we suggest that XRF 060428B may have been strongly gravitationally lensed, allowing us to detect an underluminous burst at high-z. This would naturally explain the otherwise coincidental proximity to a nearby galaxy., We present high-resolution (R~24,600) near-IR spectroscopy of the youngest super star clusters (SSCs) in the prototypical starburst merger, the Antennae galaxies. These SSCs are young (3-7 Myr old) and massive (10<SUP>5</SUP>-10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> for a Kroupa initial mass function), and their spectra are characterized by broad, extended Brackett γ (Brγ) emission, so we refer to them as emission-line clusters (ELCs) to distinguish them from older SSCs. The Brγ lines of most ELCs have supersonic widths (60-110 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> FWHM) and non-Gaussian wings whose velocities exceed the clusters' escape velocities. This high-velocity unbound gas is flowing out in winds that are powered by the clusters' massive O and Wolf-Rayet stars over the course of at least several crossing times. The large sizes of some ELCs relative to those of older SSCs may be due to expansion caused by these outflows; many of the ELCs may not survive as bound stellar systems, but rather dissipate rapidly into the field population. The observed tendency of older ELCs to be more compact than young ones is consistent with the preferential survival of the most concentrated clusters at a given age. <P />Data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation. <P />Data presented herein were obtained at the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope., We model the interaction between the wind from a newly formed rapidly rotating magnetar and the surrounding supernova shock and host star. The dynamics is modelled using the two-dimensional, axisymmetric thin-shell equations. In the first ~10-100 s after core-collapse the magnetar inflates a bubble of plasma and magnetic fields behind the supernova shock. The bubble expands asymmetrically because of the pinching effect of the toroidal magnetic field, even if the host star is spherically symmetric, just as in the analogous problem of the evolution of pulsar wind nebulae. The degree of asymmetry depends on E<SUB>mag</SUB>/E<SUB>tot</SUB>, the ratio of the magnetic energy to the total energy in the bubble. The correct value of E<SUB>mag</SUB>/E<SUB>tot</SUB> is uncertain because of uncertainties in the conversion of magnetic energy into kinetic energy at large radii in relativistic winds; we argue, however, that bubbles inflated by newly formed magnetars are likely to be significantly more magnetized than their pulsar counterparts. We show that for a ratio of magnetic to total power supplied by the central magnetar the bubble expands relatively spherically. For , however, most of the pressure in the bubble is exerted close to the rotation axis, driving a collimated outflow out through the host star. This can account for the collimation inferred from observations of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Outflows from magnetars become increasingly magnetically dominated at late times, due to the decrease in neutrino-driven mass loss as the young neutron star cools. We thus suggest that the magnetar-driven bubble initially expands relatively spherically, enhancing the energy of the associated supernova, while at late times it becomes progressively more collimated, producing the GRB. The same physical processes may operate in more modestly rotating neutron stars to produce asymmetric supernovae and lower energy transients such as X-ray flashes., The triple nucleus of M31 consists of a population of old red stars in an eccentric disk (P1 and P2) and another population of younger A stars in a circular disk (P3) around M31's central supermassive black hole (SMBH). We argue that P1 and P2 determine the maximal radial extent of the younger A star population and provide the gas that fueled the starburst that generated P3. The eccentric stellar disk creates an m=1 nonaxisymmetric perturbation to the potential. This perturbed potential drives gas into the inner parsec around the SMBH, if the pattern speed of the eccentric stellar disk is Ω<SUB>p</SUB>&lt;~3-10 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>. We show that stellar mass loss from P1 and P2 is sufficient to create a gravitationally unstable gaseous disk of ~10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> every 0.1-1 Gyr, consistent with the 200 Myr age of P3. Similar processes may act in other systems to produce very compact nuclear starbursts., We report the results of a 944 epoch survey for transient sources with archival data from the Very Large Array spanning 22 years with a typical epoch separation of 7 days. Observations were obtained at 5 or 8.4 GHz for a single field of view and achieved a typical point-source detection threshold at the beam center of 300 μJy per epoch. Ten transient sources were detected with a significance threshold such that only one false positive would be expected. Of these transients, eight were detected in only a single epoch. Two transients were too faint to be detected in individual epochs but were detected in 2 month averages. None of the 10 transients was detected in longer term averages or associated with persistent emission in the deep image produced from the combination of all epochs. The cumulative rate for the short-timescale radio transients above 370 μJy at 5 and 8.4 GHz is 0.07 deg<SUP>-2</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>&lt;~R&lt;~40 deg<SUP>-2</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, where the uncertainty is due to the unknown duration of the transients, 20 minutes &lt; t<SUB>char</SUB> &lt; 7 days. A two-epoch survey for transients will detect 1.5+/-0.4 transients per square degree above a flux density of 370 μJy. Two transients are associated with galaxies at z=0.040 and z=0.249. These may be similar to the peculiar Type Ib/c radio supernova SN 1998bw associated with GRB 980428. We detect no counterparts for six transients in deep optical and infrared imaging. The hosts and progenitors of these transients are unknown., This paper reports results of a detailed study of charge collection and signal-to-noise performance of CMOS monolithic pixel sensors before and after back-thinning to 50 and 40μm. This study shows that neither their noise nor their response to ionising particles has been degraded by the thinning process. The thinned chips have been used to build a pixel beam telescope for the ALS 1.5 GeV e<SUP></SUP> beam test facility. After alignment, an extrapolation resolution better than 9μm has been measured for a configuration of four equally spaced pixel detector planes., The ISI (Infrared Stellar Interferometer), an interferometer operating at mid-infrared wavelengths will be discussed, including both the instrumentation and results of stellar measurements. The ISI operates in the 10 micron wavelength region using three movable telescopes and heterodyne detection with CO <SUB>II</SUB> laser local oscillators. Phase closure allows rather complete imaging of stars and their dust shells, including measurement of asymmetries. Measurements have been conducted of the emission of material from stars, some ejected at very high velocity, the size and change of size of some stars, stellar ellipticity, and stellar asymmetry. Material blown off from stars is often emitted in periodic shells, and frequently asymmetric., The normal electric field structure of a supercritical (M ms = 5.2), quasiperpendicular (theta Bn = 70°) collisionless shock is examined using Cluster four-spacecraft observations of the terrestrial bow shock. Comparing the observed electric field with magnetic field and plasma observations, two different techniques find that the J × B/ne term in the generalized Ohm's law accounts for a majority of the large-scale normal electric field and potential drop encountered by the ions - the solar wind ion deceleration is in good empirical agreement with the observed potential drop, confirming earlier work. Large amplitude electric field fluctuations on shorter timescales, corresponding to fine scale structure, are not observed to contribute to the ion energization., Combining both the Northern Sky Variability Survey (NSVS) and the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) has allowed us to search for rare types of eclipsing variable stars based upon their light curves and V, J, H and K colors. We have found 10 new cool algols as well as 52 new giant star (GS) eclipsing binary systems. Using the two surveys we have found 8 new possible subdwarf B star (sdB) eclipsing binaries. Six are systems with periods longer than one day and contain a companion star of M2 or later.=20 The 2 others have short periods and contain an earlier main sequence companion., We explore, through a simplified, semianalytic model, the formation of dense clusters containing massive stars. The parent cloud spawning the cluster is represented as an isothermal sphere. This sphere is in near-force balance between self-gravity and turbulent pressure. Self-gravity, mediated by turbulent dissipation, drives slow contraction of the cloud, eventually leading to a sharp central spike in density and the onset of dynamical instability. We suggest that, in a real cloud, this transition marks the late and rapid production of massive stars. We also offer an empirical prescription, akin to the Schmidt law, for low-mass star formation in our contracting cloud. Applying this prescription to the Orion Nebula Cluster, we are able to reproduce the accelerating star formation previously inferred from the distribution of member stars in the HR diagram. The cloud turns about 10% of its mass into low-mass stars before becoming dynamically unstable. Over a cloud free-fall time, this figure drops to 1%, consistent with the overall star formation efficiency of molecular clouds in the Galaxy., SNAP is a proposed space-based experiment designed to quantify dark energy by measuring the redshift-magnitude diagram of supernovae and to quantify the growth of structure in the universe by measuring weak gravitational lensing over cosmological distances. The baseline SNAP telescope is an ambient temperature three-mirror anastigmat (TMA). The goal of the stray light design is to ensure that stray light in the 0.4 to 1.7 micron wavelength range does not exceed a small fraction of Zodiacal radiation within the mission's target field near the North ecliptic pole. At visible wavelengths, we expect the primary source of stray light will be starlight scattered by the primary mirror. In our longest wavelength NIR band we expect thermal emission from the mirrors and structure will dominate. Scattered stray light is mitigated by an internal field stop, and a cold (140K) internal aperture stop. Stray light scattered by mirror roughness and particulate contamination, as well as scattering from the telescope baffles are modeled and quantified. The baseline design and analyses contained herein ensure that stray light will be less than 10% of Zodiacal in all bands., The Imager for Sprites and Upper Atmospheric Lightning (ISUAL) on the FORMOSAT-2 spacecraft observes Transient Luminous Events (TLE) like sprites, elves, and halos from space. We analyzed halos that were observed in Central America close enough to ELF/VLF receivers that allowed for the determination of the polarity of the parent lightning. All halos were created by negative cloud to ground lightning (-CG) strokes that occurred almost exclusively over the open water. Only three out of the 31 events happened over land. We conclude that the Central American region seems to be special with respect to the large proportion of -CG created halos. Such a behavior is very different from the occurrence of sprites that are mostly created by positive cloud to ground lightning., We compare and contrast the Korsch (1972) full-field three-mirror anastigmat telescope (TMA) to the Korsch (1977) annular-field TMA. Both TMAs offer flat fields with comparably good aberration correction and comparably good telephoto advantage. Both offer good accessibility of the focal plane. The advantages of the FFTMA are its extremely uniform focal length over its field, its nearly telecentric final focus, and the fact that there is no hole in the center of its field. The advantages of the AFTMA are its complete accessible cold stop (essential if a warm telescope is to be used to image the sky at near-IR wavelengths) and its low sensitivity to mirror location error. Either alternative can deliver diffraction-limited visible-wavelength images over a one degree diameter field with a two meter aperture., The rings of Uranus are oriented edge-on to Earth in 2007 for the first time since their 1977 discovery. This event provides a rare opportunity to observe their dark (unlit) side, where dense rings darken to near invisibility, but faint rings become much brighter. We present a ground-based infrared image of the unlit side of the rings that shows that the system has changed dramatically since previous views. A broad cloud of faint material permeates the system but is not correlated with the well-known narrow rings or with the embedded dust belts imaged by the Voyager spacecraft. Although some differences can be explained by the unusual viewing angle, we conclude that the dust distribution within the system has changed substantially since the 1986 Voyager encounter and that it occurs on much larger scales than has been seen in other planetary systems., , Microchannel plates have, because of their adaptability to various size and configuration formats, allowed a wide range of devices to be realized in astronomical applications for X-ray, UV and visible sensing, employing many different forms of readout techniques and photocathode types. Two essential performance issues are the quantum detection efficiency, and the uniformity of response over the detector field of view. In both of these areas microchannel plates have had issues, both in the consistency of high quantum detection efficiency, and in fixed pattern noise introduced by fabrication processes for microchannel plates. We show that recent work has improved the consistency of obtaining high quantum detection efficiency, and has virtually eliminated the causes of fixed pattern noise due to fabrication issues., We have analyzed electron angular distributions recorded near Mars over a period of 7 years in order to constrain the topology of magnetic field lines near Mars. We used 63 million pitch angle distributions of 115 eV electrons measured at ~400 km altitudes by the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft and classified them according to their shape. Closed magnetic field lines are associated with the Martian crustal magnetic fields and are identified on the nightside by the presence of plasma voids or two-sided loss cones (trapped distributions). Trapped distributions on the nightside are most often observed in regions surrounding moderate or strong crustal fields, indicating a source process such as reconnection populates the outer layers of closed magnetic field regions. Open magnetic field lines are identified in regions of strong crustal magnetic field by the absence of field-aligned electrons returning from the planet (loss cones). In regions far from crustal sources many field lines intersect the collisional atmosphere. On the Martian dayside, closed field lines are identified by the presence of trapped or fully isotropic distributions, and they occur at times when ionospheric photoelectron features are evident in MGS electron energy spectra. Variability of the dominant pitch angle distribution shape in certain regions suggests that Martian magnetic field topology is dynamic and is controlled by external conditions., We report on two intermediate polar star systems, RX J1730-06 and RX J1803+40. We analyze a total of 97.4 hours of data for RX J1730-06 and 17.5 hours for the system RX J1803+40. We confirm previously reported spin periods (128 s and 25.4 min, respectively) and give a best-fit non-linear least-squares ephemeris for each., Within a half-parsec from the Galactic center (GC), there is a population of coeval young stars that appear to reside in a coherent disk around a massive black hole. Surrounding this dynamically cool stellar system, there is another population of stars with a similar age and much larger eccentricities and inclinations relative to the disk. We propose a hypothesis for the origin of this dynamical dichotomy. Without specifying any specific mechanism, we consider the possibility that both stellar populations were formed within a single disk some 6+/-2 Myr ago. But this orderly structure was dynamically perturbed from the outside in by an intruding intermediate-mass black hole or a dark cluster with a mass of ~10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>. We suggest that, under the action of dynamical friction, this perturber migrated inward to ~0.15-0.3 pc from the GC. Along the way, it captured many stars in the outer disk region into its mean motion resonance, forced them to migrate with it, excited their eccentricity and inclination, and engaged them in close encounters. However, stars in the inner regions of the disk retain their initial coplanar structure. Our simulations show that a perturber on a low-inclination or overhead orbit to the disk plane can lead to the observed kinematic properties of these young stars, albeit it is unlikely to produce the controversial two-disk structure. We predict that some of the inclined and eccentric stars surrounding the disk may have similar values of the galactocentric semimajor axis, and precision determination of their orbits will provide a test for this hypothesis, as well as evidence for a dark companion around the massive black hole at the GC., The next generation of Compton telescopes (such as MEGA or NCT) will detect impinging gamma rays by measuring one or more Compton interactions, possibly electron tracks, and a final photo absorption. However, the recovery of the original parameters of the photon, especially its energy and direction, is a challenging task, since the measured data only consists of a set of energy and position measurements and their ordering, i.e. the path of the photon, is unknown. Thus the main tasks of the pattern recognition algorithm are to identify the interaction sequence of the photon (i.e. which hit is the start point) and distinguish the pattern from background signatures, especially incompletely absorbed events. The most promising approach up to now is based on Bayesian statistics: The Compton interactions are parameterized in a multi-dimensional data space, which contains the interaction information of the Compton sequence as well as geometry information of the detector. For each data space cell the probability that the corresponding interaction sequence is one of a correctly ordered, completely absorbed source photon can be determined by Bayesian statistics and detailed simulations. This probability can then be used to distinguish source photons from incompletely absorbed photons. Simulations show that the Bayesian approach can improve the 68% event containment of the ARM distribution by up to 40%, and results in a much better separation between ""good"" and ""bad"" events. In addition, sensitivity improvements up to a factor 1.7 can be achieved., We present a semianalytic model for the shaping of the Homunculus Nebula around η Carinae that accounts for the simultaneous production of bipolar lobes and an equatorial disk through a rotating surface explosion. Material is launched normal to the surface of an oblate rotating star with an initial kick velocity that scales approximately with the local escape speed. Thereafter, ejecta follow ballistic orbital trajectories, feeling only a central force corresponding to a radiatively reduced gravity. Our model is conceptually similar to the wind-compressed disk model of Bjorkman &amp; Cassinelli, but we modify it to an explosion instead of a steady line-driven wind, we include a rotationally distorted star, and we treat the dynamics somewhat differently. A continuum-driven explosion, where the radiation force is independent of velocity, avoids the disk inhibition mechanisms that normally operate in line-driven winds. This allows midlatitude material with appropriate initial specific energy to migrate toward the equator, where it collides with material from the opposite hemisphere to form a disk. Thus, our model provides a simple method by which rotating hot stars can simultaneously produce intrinsically bipolar and equatorial mass ejections, without relying on an aspherical environment or magnetic fields. Although motivated by η Carinae, the model may have generic application to episodic mass ejection where rotation is important, including other luminous blue variables, B[e] stars, the nebula around SN 1987A, or possibly even bipolar supernova explosions themselves. In cases where near-Eddington radiative driving is less influential, our model generalizes to produce bipolar pinched-waist morphologies without disks, as seen in many planetary nebulae. If rotating single stars can produce strongly axisymmetric ejecta by this mechanism, then the presence of aspherical ejecta by itself is insufficient justification to invoke close binary evolution. <P />Based in part on observations obtained at the Gemini Observatory, which is operated by AURA, under a cooperative agreement with the NSF on behalf of the Gemini partnership: the National Science Foundation (US), the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (UK), the National Research Council (Canada), CONICYT (Chile), the Australian Research Council (Australia), CNPq (Brazil), and CONICET (Argentina)., The TEDI (TripleSpec Exoplanet Discovery Instrument) will be the first instrument fielded specifically for finding low-mass stellar companions. The instrument is a near infra-red interferometric spectrometer used as a radial velocimeter. TEDI joins Externally Dispersed Interferometery (EDI) with an efficient, medium-resolution, near IR (0.9 - 2.4 micron) echelle spectrometer, TripleSpec, at the Palomar 200 telescope. We describe the instrument and its radial velocimetry demonstration program to observe cool stars., We report the discovery and early observations of the peculiar Type IIn supernova (SN) 2006gy in NGC 1260. With a peak visual magnitude of about -22, it is the most luminous supernova ever recorded. Its very slow rise to maximum took ~70 days, and it stayed brighter than -21 mag for about 100 days. It is not yet clear what powers the enormous luminosity and the total radiated energy of ~10<SUP>51</SUP> erg, but we argue that any known mechanism-thermal emission, circumstellar interaction, or <SUP>56</SUP>Ni decay-requires a very massive progenitor star. The circumstellar interaction hypothesis would require truly exceptional conditions around the star, which, in the decades before its death, must have experienced a luminous blue variable (LBV) eruption like the 19th century eruption of η Carinae. However, this scenario fails to explain the weak and unabsorbed soft X-rays detected by Chandra. Radioactive decay of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni may be a less objectionable hypothesis, but it would imply a large Ni mass of ~22 M<SUB>solar</SUB>, requiring SN 2006gy to have been a pair-instability supernova where the star's core was obliterated. While this is still uncertain, SN 2006gy is the first supernova for which we have good reason to suspect a pair-instability explosion. Based on a number of lines of evidence, we eliminate the hypothesis that SN 2006gy was a ``Type IIa'' event, that is, a white dwarf exploding inside a hydrogen envelope. Instead, we propose that the progenitor was a very massive evolved object like η Carinae that, contrary to expectations, failed to shed its hydrogen envelope. SN 2006gy implies that some of the most massive stars can explode prematurely during the LBV phase, never becoming Wolf-Rayet stars. SN 2006gy also suggests that they can create brilliant supernovae instead of experiencing ignominious deaths through direct collapse to a black hole. If such a fate is common among the most massive stars, then observable supernovae from Population III stars in the early universe will be more numerous than previously believed., We present the first regional-scale chemistry simulation investigating the effects of biogenic 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol (MBO) emissions on air quality. In a central California model domain, MBO emissions have a distinctly different regional pattern than isoprene but have similar daily maxima of about 5 mg m<SUP>-2</SUP> hr<SUP>-1</SUP>. MBO oxidation causes an increase in ozone, formaldehyde, acetone and consequently hydrogen radical production (PHO<SUB>x</SUB>). The addition of MBO increases the daily maximum ozone as much as 3 ppb near source regions (2-5% in rural areas) and as much as 1 ppb in the Central Valley. Formaldehyde concentrations increase by as much as 1 ppb (40%) over the Sierra Nevada Mountains, increasing the production of HO<SUB>x</SUB> by 10-20% and accelerating local chemistry. This indicates that inclusion of MBO and other biogenic oxygenated emissions in regional simulations in the western and southeastern United States is essential for accurate representation of ozone and HO<SUB>x</SUB>., We examine the problem of obtaining the thermal structure and bulk chemical composition of the lower mantle from its seismologically determined velocity and density profiles, and the most recent results on the elastic properties of the relevant phases (including, of particular importance, shear moduli). A novel aspect of this paper is the application of an iterative technique solving generalized non-linear inverse problem, which allows us to simultaneously consider a complex chemical system (the MgO-FeO-SiO<SUB>2</SUB>-Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>-CaO system, which includes all major components in the lower mantle), and to rigorously evaluate the full covariance and resolution matrices. The effects of experimental uncertainties in the shear moduli are carefully accounted for. We show that although the a posteriori uncertainties in the results for lower-mantle compositions are relatively large, the averaged lower-mantle Mg/Si ratio should be lower than 1.3 in order to satisfactorily fit the 1-D seismic profiles. Two distinct families of best-fitting models are determined. The first is based upon a value for the pressure derivative of the perovskite shear modulus that is representative of various existing experimental measurements (μ'<SUB>0</SUB> = 1.8). Under this assumption, it is not possible to match the lower mantle seismic properties with an adiabatic geotherm and uniform chemical composition. Instead, this family of solutions is characterized by a geotherm with large temperature gradients (dT/dz increases from 0.5 to 0.9 Kkm<SUP>-1</SUP> between 800 and 2700 km and the temperature reaches 3400 K at the depth of 2700 km), and a depth dependent bulk composition with an Mg/Si ratio decreasing from 1.18 +/- 0.14 to 1.03 +/- 0.16 between 800 and 2700 km. The second family of solutions is obtained when we attempt to fit the lower mantle with a simpler compositional and thermal structure. This can only be done when the pressure derivative of the shear modulus for perovskite is close to the most recent values obtained by Brillouin spectroscopy, that is, with a μ'<SUB>0</SUB> close to 1.6 instead of 1.8. The resulting temperature gradient is 0.25 Kkm<SUP>-1</SUP> in the upper part of the lower mantle and 0.5 Kkm<SUP>-1</SUP> below 1700 km depth; the geotherm reaches 2800 K at a depth of 2700 km. Corresponding Mg/Si ratio remains rather constant and close to 1.16 throughout the lower mantle. We show that the temperature gradient is strongly correlated with the pressure derivative μ'<SUB>0</SUB> of the shear modulus of perovskite: lower values of μ'<SUB>0</SUB> imply lower thermal gradients. We also discuss the importance of the Bullen parameter as an additional constraint. In order to refine conclusions on the lower-mantle structure, additional independent observables, such as accurate observations on electrical conductivity and 1-D Q profiles, are necessary., We compute the expected value of the cosmological constant in our universe from the causal entropic principle. Since observers must obey the laws of thermodynamics and causality, the principle asserts that physical parameters are most likely to be found in the range of values for which the total entropy production within a causally connected region is maximized. Despite the absence of more explicit anthropic criteria, the resulting probability distribution turns out to be in excellent agreement with observation. In particular, we find that dust heated by stars dominates the entropy production, demonstrating the remarkable power of this thermodynamic selection criterion. The alternative approach—weighting by the number of “observers per baryon”—is less well-defined, requires problematic assumptions about the nature of observers, and yet prefers values larger than present experimental bounds., We give a new solution of the Boussinesq equations of motion describing flow driven by internal heat generation within a plane horizontal layer of viscous but thermally non-conducting fluid. The solution models the central region of a long mantle convection cell, excluding the cold plate and slab, and gives the coupled velocity and temperature fields in terms of the heating rate and material properties. Interaction of the buoyantly-driven flow with internal heat generation creates a long-wave, horizontal density gradient. Scaled to the mantle, the predicted amplitude of that gradient appears too small to observe seismically with current methods, but the corresponding flow speeds are comparable with those observed. To assume that mantle flow is driven purely by currently observable density differences may therefore be to ignore a large part of the forcing., Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) ejected by the massive black hole at the Galactic Centre have unique kinematic properties compared to other halo stars. Their trajectories will deviate from being exactly radial because of the asymmetry of the Milky Way potential produced by the flattened disc and the triaxial dark matter halo, causing a change of angular momentum that can be much larger than the initial small value at injection. We study the kinematics of HVSs and propose an estimator of dark halo triaxiality that is determined only by instantaneous position and velocity vectors of HVSs at large Galactocentric distances (r &gt;~ 50kpc). We show that, in the case of a substantially triaxial halo, the distribution of deflection angles (the angle between the stellar position and velocity vector) for HVSs on bound orbits is spread uniformly over the range 10°-180°. Future astrometric and deep wide-field surveys should measure the positions and velocities of a significant number of HVSs, and provide useful constraints on the shape of the Galactic dark matter halo., The Urey in situ organic compound analysis instrument, consisting of a subcritical water extractor (SCWE) and a portable microchip capillary electrophoresis instrument called the Mars Organic Analyzer (MOA), was field tested in the Atacama Desert, Chile, in June 2005. Soil samples from the most arid Yungay region were collected, biomarkers were extracted by the SCWE, and organic amine composition and amino acid chirality analysis was performed by the MOA. Samples collected from the top 1 cm of duracrust soil but shielded from the ambient environment by rocks were compared to the exposed duracrust. The shielded duracrust yielded amines and amino acids ranging from 50 to 100 ppb, while amino acid signals from the exposed duracrust were below blank levels. Samples from buried gypsum deposits located directly above a water flow channel contained amino acids ranging from 13 to 90 ppb. Chiral analysis revealed D/L ratios of 0.39 +/- 0.08 and 0.34 +/- 0.07 for alanine/serine and 0.78 +/- 0.06 for aspartic acid, indicating significant racemization of biologically produced amino acids. On the basis of the D/L ratios, we estimate sample ages ranging from 10<SUP>3</SUP> to 10<SUP>5</SUP> years. These results demonstrate the successful field testing of the Urey instrument, as well as the detection of biomarkers from past terrestrial life in one of the most arid and Mars-like regions on Earth., We present a cascade model for turbulence in weakly collisional plasmas that follows the nonlinear cascade of energy from the large scales of driving in the MHD regime to the small scales of the kinetic Alfvén wave regime where the turbulence is dissipated by kinetic processes. Steady-state solutions of the model for the slow solar wind yield three conclusions: (1) beyond the observed break in the magnetic energy spectrum, one expects an exponential cut-off (2) the widely held interpretation that this dissipation range obeys power-law behavior is an artifact of instrumental sensitivity limitations; and, (3) over the range of parameters relevant to the solar wind, the observed variation of dissipation range spectral indices from -2 to -4 is naturally explained by the varying effectiveness of Landau damping, from an undamped prediction of -7/3 to a strongly damped index around -4., Observations give tight constraints on the temporal and spatial scales of particle heating in solar flares, and on the required efficiency. Electrons are accelerated into a quasi-thermal population of a few tens of keV. X- and γ-rays imply tails in electron and ion distributions reaching tens of MeV and above. Simple estimates indicate that all available electrons are accelerated at least once to moderate energies, pointing to an initial process resembling bulk heating rather than acceleration of a small or localized population. In the absence of effective collisions, wave-particle interactions are the prime candidate. Here we address the outstanding questions, (i) what process can heat the entire reconnecting plasma to the above energies, and (ii) what provides the free energy for wave-particle interactions? We propose a process in which initially the ions are heated and provide the free energy for electron heating and tail formation., The absent or weak magnetic field above large Martian volcanoes may provide constraints on their formation and the carrier of magnetization. We consider the ability of magma intrusions to thermally demagnetize the shallow crust beneath volcanoes through heat conduction and hydrothermal circulation. If magnetization is dominated by magnetite, the volume of crust that is thermally demagnetized is similar to the volume of crust emplaced since the dynamo field disappeared. If magnetization is dominated by pyrrhotite, the volume of crust that is demagnetized is typically more than twice the volume of magma intruded. Hydrothermal circulation contributes negligible additional thermal demagnetization, beyond that from heat conduction alone, for permeabilities less than O(10<SUP>-15</SUP>) m<SUP>2</SUP>., Recent studies suggest that flux-tube-like structures may exist in the solar wind. In this scenario, the solar wind plasma are confined in many individual flux tubes and plasma in these flux tubes move independently from each other. Within each flux tubes, the (MHD) turbulence is due to the local non-linear dynamics. Across the boundaries between adjacent flux tubes, however, the (MHD) turbulence receives another contribution from the sudden change of magnetic field directions between different flux tubes. Thus the solar wind turbulence will naturally be of multiscale and intermittent. In this paper, using the procedure we developed in [1], we analyze magnetic field data obtained from Ulysses spacecraft in both fast and slow solar wind, at various radii and latitudes. Our results show flux tubes exist in both the fast and the slow solar wind., All four giant planets are surrounded by ring systems, which typically consist of a combination of large and small bodies, as well as fine dust. With the 10-m W.M. Keck telescope on Mauna Kea (Hawaii) we have focused on observing the dusty rings of these planets. In this review I will summarize our data sets. I will focus on our most recent results with regard to Jupiter and Uranus, both observed during ring plane crossings. Jupiter's ring system was observed in December 2002 and January 2003 at 2.2 micron, where we used both the facility near-infrared camera NIRC with a pixel size of 0.151"" (∼500 km at Jupiter), and the adaptive optics camera NIRC2, with a pixelsize of 0.04"" and 0.01"". The images were ""onion-peeled"" to provide radial scans of the rings. We will compare results of the main ring with Galileo data, and comment on similarities and differences with respect to the location of parent material in the ring. The radial structure of the gossamer rings is very different than expected based upon the Burns et al (1999) formation scenarios. The rings are not sheets of material, but narrow rings located just interior to the orbits of Amalthea and Thebe. The Amalthea ring shows a structure analagous to the main ring. Its inner boundary is near the location of synchronous orbit. Radial variations in the Thebe ring suggest ""sculpting"" by Lorentz resonances. We will present images of Uranus ""hot of the press""; we are scheduled to observe in July and August when the rings are edge-on., Larmor size transient structures with depletions as large as 99% of ambient solar wind density levels occur commonly upstream of Earth's collisionless bow shock. These ``density holes'' have a mean duration of ~17.9 +/- 10.4s but holes as short as 4s have been observed. The average fractional density depletion (δn/n) inside the holes is ~0.68 +/- 0.14. The density of the upstream edge moving in the sunward direction can be enhanced by five or more times the solar wind density. Particle distributions show the steepened edge can behave like a shock, and measured local field geometries and Mach number support this view. Similarly shaped magnetic holes accompany the density holes indicating strong coupling between fields and particles. The density holes are only observed with upstream particles, suggesting that back-streaming particles interacting with the solar wind are important., In this thesis, I first discuss the execution and principal data products of the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey, a spectroscopic redshift survey designed to study the galaxy population and large-scale structure of the Universe at z ~ 1. In particular, I describe the spectroscopic observing operations and data reduction procedures developed and employed. In addition, DEEP2 is presented in comparison to past and present surveys of the local and distant galaxy populations, with an eye towards future studies at z [Special characters omitted.] 1. Finally, I detail the final DEEP2 redshift catalog and its public release. <P />Second, I test the applicability of various galaxy environment measures within deep redshift surveys, using mock galaxy catalogs to mimic representative photometric and spectroscopic redshift surveys at intermediate redshift ( z ~ 1). From this analysis, I conclude that photometric redshifts lack the velocity precision required to cleanly discriminate the environments of galaxies, as even the smallest photometric-redshift errors achieved are much larger than galaxy correlation lengths (&lt; 5 h -1 comoving Mpc versus &gt; 15 h -1 comoving Mpc for s z = 0.01). In addition, I study the impact of edges and holes in a survey field, redshift-space distortions, and target selection upon different environment estimators. For the DEEP2 survey, I conclude that among the environment measures tested the projected n th -nearest-neighbor distance measure provides the most accurate estimate of local galaxy density over a continuous and broad range of scales. <P />Using these techniques, derived from tests on mock galaxy catalogs, in conjunction with the DEEP2 data set, I then investigate the role of environment in the evolution of galaxy properties over the last 7-10 Gyr. I find that all major features of the relationship between rest-frame color and local galaxy density, as observed in the local Universe, were already in place at z ~ 1. Furthermore, analysis of the evolution in the color-density relation at intermediate redshift shows that the build-up of red galaxies in dense regions is driven by group-like environments (i.e., not clusters), with typical ~ L* galaxies beginning to quench and move onto the red sequence at z ~ 2. While environment is critical to the build-up of the red sequence at z &lt; 1, inspection of the relationship between galaxy overdensity and star formation shows that environment does not play the dominant role in the decline of the cosmic star-formation rate space density from z ~ 1 to z ~ 0. In an attempt to build upon these results, I conclude by discussing future projects, designed with the goal of understanding the bimodal nature of the local galaxy population, including the formation of the massive early-type galaxy population., In the Alfvénic regime, i.e. for frequencies below the local proton cyclotron frequency, solar wind MHD turbulence exhibits what appears like an inertial domain, with power-law spectra and scale-invariance, suggesting as in fluid turbulence, a nonlinear energy cascade from the large ``energy containing'' scales towards much smaller scales, where dissipation via kinetic effects is presumed to act. However, the intermittent character of the solar wind fluctuations in the inertial range is much more important than in ordinary fluids. Indeed, the fluctuations consist of a mixture of random fluctuations and small-scale ``singular'' or coherent structures. This intermittency modifies significantly the scaling exponents of actual power-law spectra, which are directly related to the physical nature of the energy cascade taking place in the solar wind. The identification of the most intermittent structures and their relation to dissipation represents then a crucial problem in the framework of turbulence. <P />We will discuss here recent results on scaling laws and intermittency based on the use of Wavelet transforms on simultaneous WIND 3s resolution particle and magnetic field data from the 3DP and the MFi experiments respectively. More specifically, the Haar Wavelet transform is used to compute spectra, structure functions and probability distribution functions (PDFs). We show that this powerful technique allows: (1) for a systematic study of intermittency effects on these spectra, structure functions and PDFs, thus for a clear determination of the actual scaling properties in the inertial range, and (2) for a direct and systematic identification of the most active, singular structures responsible for the intermittency in the solar wind. The analysis of structure functions and PDFs and new results on the nature of the intermittent coherent structures will be presented., Organic materials, containing only H, C, N, and O, are observed in proto- planetary discs, comets and meteorites, which provide the keys to understanding the early Earth. Direct study of two molecules common in these environments, formic acid (HCOOH) and cyanuric acid (H 3 C 3 N 3 O 3 ), has shown that these molecules survive to higher pressures and temperatures than expected and transform to more complex molecules, implying that high-pressure environments associated with young planets could be a key source of prebiotic molecules in the early Earth. Complementary models of generic planetary interiors have been undertaken, in order to better understand environments outside the Earth which could harbor prebiotic chemistry. <P />To determine the stability, phase, and reaction limits of formic acid and cyanuric acid, Raman and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were used with heated diamond-anvil cell experiments. The melting curve of formic acid and two decomposition reactions were determined. A third solid-solid reaction was identified at higher pressures, with evidence of the formation of more complex molecules, recoverable to ambient conditions. The chemistry of cyanuric acid was shown to be more complex, with a decomposition reaction taking the place of a melting curve, and the formation of new molecules whose composition varies with the pressure at which the reaction occurs. These new molecules have been identified as di- and tri- substituted benzene molecules and heterocyclic aromatic molecules, a step towards more complex organized prebiotic chemistry. <P />With the recent discovery of super-Earths orbiting other stars, data on planetary masses and radii outside our solar system is rapidly becoming available. The effects of self compression on the internal structure of planetary bodies are poorly understood. Planetary models using the second-order Birch- Murnaghan equation of state to model a spherical body under hydrostatic equilibrium were used to understand the effects of changing the material properties on astronomical observables such as the moment of inertia, radius and mass. The resulting density profiles help constrain the survival depths of organic materials in addition to providing mass vs. radius curves for planets of varying compositions. These mass vs. radius plots show that present mass- radius observations can help constrain the composition of an exoplanet., We discuss a recalibration of Ca II H&amp;K measures in sun-like stars, It is becoming ever easier to obtain first class astronomical data by working solely from one's computer terminal, the modern equivalent of the armchair. This wonderful development may tempt us to forget that astronomical discoveries and findings are first and foremost driven by hard-won progress in observational and experimental capabilities. The present article is meant to demonstrate this assertion by reviewing recent developments and future possibilities in studying the Center of the Milky Way, our best case for the existence of a (massive) black hole and a superb laboratory for studying the physical processes in the immediate vicinity of such an enigmatic object., A remarkable variety of particle acceleration occurs in the solar system, from lightning-related acceleration of electrons to tens of MeV energy in less than a millisecond in planetary atmospheres; to acceleration of auroral and radiation belt particles in planetary magnetospheres; to acceleration at planetary bow shocks, co-rotating interplanetary region shocks, shocks driven by fast coronal mass ejections, and possibly at the heliospheric termination shock; to acceleration in magnetic reconnection regions in solar flares and at planetary magnetopause and magnetotail current sheets. These acceleration processes often occur in conjunction with transient energy releases, and some are very efficient. Unlike acceleration processes outside the solar system, the accelerated particles and the physical conditions in the acceleration region can be studied through direct in situ measurements, and/or through detailed imaging and spectroscopy. Here I review recent observations of tens of MeV electron acceleration in the Earth's atmosphere and in the Earth's radiation belts, electron and ion acceleration related to magnetic reconnection in solar flares, electron acceleration to ≥ 300 keV in magnetic reconnection regions in the Earth's deep magnetotail, and acceleration of solar energetic particles (SEPs) by shocks driven by fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs)., We report observations of the ro-vibronic aΔ→XΣ transition of SO at 1.707 μm on Io. These data were taken while Io was eclipsed by Jupiter, on four nights between July 2000 and March 2003. We analyze these results in conjunction with a previously published night to investigate the temporal behavior of these emissions. The observations were all conducted using the near-infrared spectrometer NIRSPEC on the W.M. Keck II telescope. The integrated emitted intensity for this band varies from 0.8×10 to 2.4×10 photons/s, with a possible link to variations in Loki's infrared brightness. The band-shapes imply rotational temperatures of 550-1000 K for the emitting gas, lending further evidence to a volcanic origin for sulfur monoxide. An attempt to detect the BΣ→XΣ transition of SO at 0.97 μm was unsuccessful; simultaneous detection with the 1.707 μm band would permit determination of the SO column abundance., We study quantum entanglements of baby universes which appear in non-perturbative corrections to the OSV formula for the entropy of extremal black holes in type IIA string theory compactified on the local Calabi Yau manifold defined as a rank 2 vector bundle over an arbitrary genus G Riemann surface. This generalizes the result for G=1 in hep-th/0504221. Non-perturbative terms can be organized into a sum over contributions from baby universes, and the total wave-function is their coherent superposition in the third quantized Hilbert space. We find that half of the universes preserve one set of supercharges while the other half preserve a different set, making the total universe stable but non-BPS. The parent universe generates baby universes by brane/anti-brane pair creation, and baby universes are correlated by conservation of non-normalizable D-brane charges under the process. There are no other source of entanglement of baby universes, and all possible states are superposed with the equal weight., We present measurements of the higher order clustering of red and blue galaxies as a function of scale and luminosity made from the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dFGRS). We use a counts-in-cells analysis to estimate the volume-averaged correlation functions, , as a function of scale up to the order of p = 5, and also the reduced void probability function. Hierarchical amplitudes are constructed using the estimates of the correlation functions: . We find that (i) red galaxies display stronger clustering than blue galaxies at all orders measured; (ii) red galaxies show values of S<SUB>p</SUB> that are strongly dependent on luminosity whereas blue galaxies show no segregation in S<SUB>p</SUB> within the errors; this is remarkable given the segregation in the variance; (iii) the linear relative bias shows the opposite trend to the hierarchical amplitudes, with little segregation for the red sequence and some segregation for the blue; (iv) faint red galaxies deviate significantly from the `universal' negative binomial reduced void probabilities followed by all other galaxy populations. Our results show that the characteristic colour of a galaxy population reveals a unique signature in its spatial distribution. Such signatures will hopefully further elucidate the physics responsible for shaping the cosmological evolution of galaxies., Supernovae of Type IIn possess spectral signatures that indicate an intense interaction between the supernova ejecta and surrounding dense circumstellar material cast off by the star in pre-explosion mass-loss episodes. Studying this interaction can yield clues to the nature of Type IIn progenitors and their mass loss history. In particular, polarization spectra of Type IIn's show complex line polarization and position angle features that arise from a combination of geometrical and optical effects. I have constructed a Monte Carlo code that simulates the transfer of the Hα line through circumstellar shells with various geometrical configurations and optical characteristics. The superposition of broad and narrow line components produced in different regions of the circumstellar environment and modified by electron and line scattering, hydrogen absorption, thermal emission, and geometrical and viewing angle effects gives rise to a variety of polarized line shapes in the model spectra. Comparison of these results with recent high-quality spectropolarimetric observations of Type IIn supernovae suggests that a model ``shock"" region between the supernova photosphere and the circumstellar shell is necessary to produce the narrow polarized emission features at the rest wavelength of Hα seen in some IIn's. Further model results point toward other features in the polarized line profile that can be used to constrain the characteristics of the circumstellar material in these intriguing objects. The code's usefulness will be extended by the treatment of Doppler effects due to expansion of the circumstellar scattering region, such as those that characterize the polarized Hα profiles of the Type IIn SN 1997eg., We report precision Doppler measurements of three intermediate-mass subgiants obtained at Lick and Keck Observatories. All three stars show variability in their radial velocities consistent with planet-mass companions in Keplerian orbits. We find a planet with a minimum mass M<SUB>P</SUB>sini=2.5 M<SUB>J</SUB> in a 351.5 day orbit around HD 192699, a planet with a minimum mass of 2.0 M<SUB>J</SUB> in a 341.1 day orbit around HD 210702, and a planet with a minimum mass of 0.61 M<SUB>J</SUB> in a 297.3 day orbit around HD 175541. Mass estimates from stellar interior models indicate that all three stars were formerly A-type, main-sequence dwarfs with masses ranging from 1.65 to 1.85 M<SUB>solar</SUB>. These three long-period planets would not have been detectable during their stars' main-sequence phases due to the large rotational velocities and stellar jitter exhibited by early-type dwarfs. There are now nine ``retired'' (evolved) A-type stars (M<SUB>*</SUB>&gt;1.6 M<SUB>solar</SUB>) with known planets. All nine planets orbit at distances a&gt;=0.78 AU, which is significantly different from the semimajor axis distribution of planets around lower mass stars. <P />Based on observations obtained at the Lick Observatory, which is operated by the University of California, and W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated jointly by the University of California and the California Institute of Technology., We investigate the possibility of using high precision timing measurements of radio pulsars to constrain or detect the stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB). Improved algorithms are presented for more accurately determining the pulse times of arrival at Earth and characterizing pulse profile shape variation. Next, we describe the design and construction of a new set of pulsar backends based on clusters of standard personal computers. These machines, the Astronomy Signal Processors (ASPS), coherently correct the pulse broadening caused by interstellar plasma dispersion. Since they are based in software, they are inherently more flexible than previous generations of pulsar data recorders. In addition, they provide increased bandwidth and quantization accuracy. We apply these methods to 2.5 years worth of millisecond pulsar data recorded with the ASP systems at the Arecibo and Green Bank Telescopes, and present pulse profiles, dispersion measure variation, and timing model parameters derived from this data. <P />We then develop the theory of gravitational wave detection using pulsar timing, and show how data from several pulsars can be combined into a pulsar timing array for this purpose. In particular, a new method of accounting for the effect of the timing model fit on the gravitational wave signal is presented. This method incorporates the exact timing model basis functions without relying on Monte Carlo simulation. We apply this method to the 2.5 year dataset previously mentioned and derive a gravitational wave limit of h c (1 yr -1 ) &lt; 2.46 × 10 -14 . Finally, we study the 20-year timing record of PSR B1937+21 and obtain information on how severely interstellar medium effects will compromise future GWB detection. We predict that these developments, in conjunction with historical data, could provide the first successful direct gravitational wave detection on a 5-10 year timescale., To understand the dynamic, magnetic, and energetic connection between the convectively unstable layers below the visible surface of the Sun and the overlying solar corona, we have developed a new three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic code capable of simultaneously evolving a model convection zone and corona within a single computational volume. As a first application of this numerical model, we present a series of simulations of the quiet Sun in a domain that encompasses both the upper convection zone and low corona. We investigate whether the magnetic field generated by a convective surface dynamo can account for some of the observed properties of the quiet-Sun atmosphere. We find that (1) it is possible to heat a model corona to X-ray-emitting temperatures with the magnetic fields generated from a convective dynamo and an empirically based heating mechanism consistent with the observed relationship between X-ray emission and magnetic flux observed at the visible surface; (2) within the limitations of our numerical models of the quiet Sun, resistive and viscous dissipation alone are insufficient to maintain a hot corona; (3) the quiet-Sun model chromosphere is a dynamic, non-force-free layer that exhibits a temperature reversal in the convective pattern in the relatively low density layers above the photosphere; (4) the majority of the unsigned magnetic flux lies below the model photosphere in the convectively unstable portion of the domain; (5) horizontally directed magnetic structures thread the low atmosphere, often connecting relatively distant concentrations of magnetic flux observed at the surface; and (6) low-resolution photospheric magnetograms can significantly underestimate the amount of unsigned magnetic flux threading the quiet-Sun photosphere., During accretion, a neutron star (NS) is spun up as angular momentum is transported through its surface layers. We study the resulting differentially rotating profile, focusing on the impact this has for type I X-ray bursts. The predominant viscosity is likely provided by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo, where toroidal magnetic field growth and Tayler instabilities balance to support a steady state magnetic field. The radial and azimuthal components have strengths of ~10<SUP>5</SUP> and ~10<SUP>10</SUP> G, respectively. This leads to nearly uniform rotation at the depths of X-ray bursts. A remaining small shear transmits the accreted angular momentum inward to the NS interior. Although this shear gives little viscous heating, it can trigger turbulent mixing. Detailed simulations will be required to fully understand the consequences of mixing, but our models illustrate some general features. Mixing has the greatest impact when the buoyancy at the compositional discontinuity between accreted matter and ashes is overcome. This occurs preferentially at high accretion rates or low spin frequencies and may depend on the ash composition from the previous burst. We then find two new regimes of burning. The first is ignition in a layer containing a mixture of heavier elements from the ashes. If ignition occurs at the base of the mixed layer, recurrence times as short as ~5-30 minutes are possible. This may explain the short recurrence time of some bursts, but incomplete burning is still needed to explain these bursts' energetics. When mixing is sufficiently strong, a second regime is found where accreted helium mixes deep enough to burn stably, quenching X-ray bursts. The carbon-rich material produced by stable helium burning would be important for triggering and fueling superbursts., Explosive events seen at extragalactic distances mark the end-state of violent and catastrophic physical processes. Most supernovae and gamma-ray bursts {GRBs}, in particular, are thought to herald the death of massive stars and the birth of solar-mass black holes. A minority fraction of GRBs, however, have been circumstantially associated with the merger of degenerate systems {such as black holes and neutron stars}. These short-duration bursts are rare and difficult to localize, with only about 2 dozen studied to any degree of detail to date. We believe that we have finally discovered, in the last few days, one of the tell-tale signatures of degenerate merger products -- a ""mini-supernova"" from the non-relativistic ejecta left over after merger. If true, this long-theorized phenomenon would be an entirely new sort of explosion in the universe. In several rapidly executed visits, HST, coupled with a recently approved Chandra DD proposal to search for underlying afterglow, could make a substantial contribution to our understanding of this phenomena by honing the physical parameters of the event and helping to rule out alternatives. If we are correct in our hypothesis, we have found the first clear cut observational signature in the electromagnetic spectrum of what are expected to the be the dominant sources of gravitational waves for advanced LIGO., NICMOS has played a key role in probing the deep near infrared regime for a decade. It has been the only instrument available to observe objects in the near infrared that are not visible from the ground. In particular, it has played a major role in the SN Ia observations at redshifts z&gt;1. However, the calibration of NICMOS has turned out to be difficult due to the apparent non-linearity of the detectors. The NICMOS calibration team has described the non-linearity as a power law based on data in the range of 50-5000 ADU/s. The correction relies on an extrapolation of two orders of magnitude in flux at count rates close to the sky level {0.1 ADU/s} where space observations are particularly prized - and where SN Ia observations are made. Precise measurements of faint objects require us to reduce the uncertainties from this extrapolation. Here we propose to derive the absolute calibration in the sky limited regime and to characterize the non-linearity over the entire dynamic range for the camera/filter combination: NIC2/F110W., Debris disk stars host transient dust grains that comprise a collisional cascade with sizes ranging from planetesimals to the sub-micron. In addition to the gravity of the host star and any planets present, these grains are subject to size-dependent non-gravitational forces, e.g., corpuscular drag and radiation pressure. When a steep spectrum of grain sizes prevails, such as the Dohnanyi distribution, scattered light images preferentially trace grains with dimensionless size parameter of order unity. Thus images in scattered starlight provide unique windows on the balance of forces acting on grains at a specific size. Therefore, in an A star system such as beta Pic, the near-IR is dominated by grains close to the blow out size and therefore NICMOS traces dust on hyperbolic orbits.Scattering is fundamentally polarization sensitive, and measurements that record intensity literally see only half the picture. If linear polarization is measured then the elements of the complex scattering matrix can be reconstructed. These matrix elements provide fundamental constraints on the size, composition and structure of the scatterers. Notably, polarimetry can be used to break the degeneracy between scattering asymmetry, g, and the radial dust gradient, which are otherwise covariant in an edge-on disk. Thus, we can use polarimetry to localize the parent bodies in the beta Pic disk.In beta Pic, dust is thought to originate mainly from the sublimation of cometary bodies near periastron. The irradiation of cometary material leads to sublimation and photodissociation of ices forming porous grains consisting of a matrix of refractory material. Such grains have a characteristic scattering signature in polarized light that can be distinguished from compact grains that arise from collisional erosion of asteroidal material., To obtain a full spectroscopic census of the universe at z 2.5 we have conducted a near-infrared spectroscopic survey for K-selected galaxies. We found that, in contrast to the local universe, massive high-redshift galaxies span a wide range of properties, varying from {dusty} star burst to ""red and dead"" galaxies. This may imply that massive galaxies transform from star-forming to quiescent galaxies in the targeted redshift range. To understand whether the 9 quiescent galaxies in our sample are the progenitors of local elliptical, we are observing them in the current cycle with NIC2. For cycle 16 we propose to complete our sample of massive z 2.5 galaxies and image the remaining 10 galaxies, which all have emission lines. Based on emission-line diagnostics, 6 of these galaxies are identified as star-forming objects and 4 harbor an active galactic nucleus. The goals are to 1} determine whether star formation in massive z 2.5 galaxies takes place in disks or is triggered by merger activity, 2} derive the contribution of AGNs to the rest-frame optical emission, and 3} test whether the morphologies are consistent with the idea that the star-forming galaxies, AGNs, and quiescent galaxies represent subsequent phases of an evolutionary sequence. The combination of both programs will provide the first morphological study of a spectroscopically confirmed massive galaxy sample at z 2.5., Fomalhaut is a bright nearby star that harbors a belt of dusty material with a morphology that has been used to predict the presence of a shepherding planet. With ACS/HRC coronagraphy, we have achieved the direct detection of a planet candidate {Fomalhaut b} in F606W and F814W. The planet candidate lies 18 AU interior to the dust belt and we detect counterclockwise orbital motion in two epochs of observations {2004 and 2006}. Fomalhaut b has mass no greater than three Jupiter masses based on an analysis of its luminosity, including non-detections at infrared wavelengths, and the dynamical argument that a significantly more massive object would disrupt the dust belt. Variability at optical wavelengths and the brightness in the F606W passband suggest additional sources of luminosity such as starlight reflected from a circumplanetary ring system. A second possibility that has been invoked for substellar objects is a significant contribution of H-alpha emission. Here we propose follow-up WFPC2 observations to test the possibility that the F606W flux is contaminated by H-alpha emission. We demonstrate that the detection of Fomalhaut b using WFPC2 is feasible using roll deconvolution. Furthermore, a detection of Fomalhaut b in 2009 will provide a crucial third epoch for astrometry. With the existing two epochs of data, the orbit of Fomalhaut b cannot be determined uniquely. The third epoch will be used to test the prediction of apsidal alignment and more accurately determine the dynamical mass of Fomalhaut b. If apsidal mis-alignment is found between the planet and the belt, this result would point to the existence of still other planets lurking unseen in the Fomalhaut system., We show that the X-ray and γ-ray spectra of Swift GRBs and their afterglows are consistent with the emission characteristic of an expanding, relativistic fireball. The classical afterglow due to the impact of the fireball on the external medium is often not observed until 1 to several hours after the GRB. Focusing on GRBs 061121, 060614, and 060124, but generalizing to the full (&gt;50 Ms XRT exposure) Swift sample up to and including GRB 061210, we show that the early emission in &gt;90% of early afterglows has a characteristic νF<SUB>ν</SUB> spectral energy E<SUB>peak</SUB>, which likely evolves from the γ-rays through the soft X-ray band on timescales of 10<SUP>2</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> s after the GRB. The observed spectra are strongly curved when plotted with logarithmic axes and have often been incorrectly fitted in other studies with a time-varying soft X-ray absorption. The spectral evolution inferred from fitting instead models used to fit GRBs demonstrates a common evolution-a power-law hardness-intensity correlation and hard-to-soft evolution-for GRBs and the early X-ray afterglows and X-ray flares. Combined with studies of short-timescale variability, our findings indicate a central engine active for longer than previously suspected. The GRB spectra are observed to become very soft at late times due to an intrinsic spectral evolution and due to the surprising faintness of some afterglows. We discuss models for the early X-ray emission., We report Cluster spacecraft 1 observations of a reconnection exhaust embedded in the magnetosheath flow. The reconnection evidence consists of (1) accelerated plasma outflows, (2) interpenetrating ion beams, (3) reconnection inflows and (4) the associated tangential reconnection electric field. Furthermore, Hall magnetic fields were observed with no gaps in the middle of the exhaust. Together with the exhaust thickness being ~ 10 ion skin depths, this implies that the spacecraft crossed through the ion diffusion region. The dimensionless reconnection rate determined independently using the plasma and electric field measurements was ~0.07, implying fast reconnection. The same (but 36 times thicker) current sheet was observed upstream in the solar wind by the ACE and Wind spacecraft but without the reconnection signatures. These observations suggest that reconnection was initiated in the magnetosheath due to compression of the (non-reconnecting) solar wind current sheet at the bow shock and against the dayside magnetopause., Here, we consider the question of which of the 20-100 keV INTEGRAL sources may be detected by GLAST. There are clearly some source types that the two satellites will have in common, such as Active Galactic Nuclei, rotation-powered pulsars, and supernova remnants, but we have performed a detailed cross-correlation between the positions of the 499 INTEGRAL sources and the 271 EGRET sources that were detected at &gt;100 MeV. We find that 31 of the EGRET sources have at least one INTEGRAL source in their error circle. Although source confusion is a problem in the Galactic Center region, we find 4 possible associations between EGRET sources and High-Mass X-ray Binaries in the Galactic disk. This could indicate that some fraction of HMXBs will be seen by GLAST., A critical step during the data analysis of pair creation telescopes is the correct identification of the electron and positron tracks. For MEGA, an electron-tracking Compton and pair telescope optimized for energies up to 50 MeV, we describe a low-energy pair event reconstruction approach partly based on Bayesian statistics., With ACS/HRC coronagraphy, we have achieved the direct detection of aplanet candidate in F606W and F814W around a bright nearby star with adebris belt. The planet candidate, Fomalhaut b, lies 18 astronomical units interior to the dust belt and we detect counterclockwise orbital motion inobservations separated by 1.75 years. The candidate has mass no greaterthan three Jupiter masses based on an analysis of its luminosity and the dynamical argument that a significantly more massive object would disrupt the dust belt. Using recent model predictions for 100-300 Myr old planetaryatmospheres, the planet candidate has a temperature of ~400 K and amass 1.6 - 3.4 M_J. Variability at optical wavelengths suggests additional sources of luminosity such as H-alpha emission or the episodic accretion of cometary material. Here we propose follow-up observations with HST/STIS coronagraphy. We employ an observing strategy that is identical to the one usedfor the detection using ACS/HRC coronagraphy. The key goal is recovery of Fomalhaut b in a third epoch that will also provide crucial astrometric informationto determine its orbit. From the new orbit estimate and models of dynamicalinteractions with the surrounding debris belt, we aim to further constrain the mass of Fomalhaut b and the evolutionary history of the system., The locations of supernovae {SNe} in the local stellar and gaseous environment in galaxies, as measured in high spatial resolution WFPC2 and ACS images, contain important clues to their progenitor stars. They provide accurate determinations of any association of SNe with H II regions or star clusters. Since multi-filter observations are generally available, we can determine the local stellar population, setting constraints on the mass of the progenitor; we can also search for possible attenuation of the SN by dust in the host galaxy by studying the colors of the stars in its environment. By checking the fields for background sources, we can correct the existing SN light curves and luminosities if necessary. When a SN has been observed incidentally, information can be gained on its optical and UV emission. Deep HST images can be used to find light echoes of SNe, as well as recover SNe interacting with circumstellar material at very late times. A direct search for the progenitor stars of SNe can be made in pre-existing HST images of their locations; as the number of archival HST images steadily increases, along with the number of newly discovered SNe, positive identifications become progressively more likely. In Cycle 16, we plan to extend our successful work from previous cycles. This proposal is complementary to our Cycle 16 survey proposal, whose primary purpose is to obtain late-time photometry of SNe. It is also complementary to our Cycle 16 ToO proposal, which is designed to pinpoint the locations of recent SNe to help determine their progenitor stars., This thesis presents both theoretical analysis and observational results on galaxy evolution using large galaxy redshift surveys. First, we constrained the evolution in the halo occupation distribution from z∼0:8 to z∼0:1, using two large galaxy redshift surveys: the 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dF) and the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey. We found that there has been very little change in the way galaxies populate dark matter halos across half the age of the universe, which put constraints on the galaxy birth rate and merger rate. We then applied the halo occupation model to build realistic mock catalogs for the DEEP2 Survey. Galaxies with a range of luminosities are placed within virialized dark matter halos in N-body simulations, using a variant of the halo model. The model parameters are chosen to reproduce local clustering and abundance data and assumed to be independent of redshift. This allows us to predict the luminosity function, two-point correlation function, luminosity- and scale-dependent bias, and redshift space distortion of our galaxies at higher redshifts. The catalogs have been used extensively in numerous analyses of the DEEP2 data. I also studied how individual galaxies can evolve by targeting a special class of objects. Poststarburst galaxies exhibit spectroscopic signatures indicating that star formation was recently quenched; they are candidates for galaxies in transition from a star-forming phase to a passively evolving phase. We discovered a critical problem in the common methods for selecting these galaxies. The emission line commonly used to define poststarburst galaxies at high z, [O II] lambda3727, is heavily contaminated by LINER (Low-ionization nuclear emission region) emission in many cases. This investigation led to the discovery of a substantial AGN presence in both red, early-type galaxies and poststarburst galaxies, which shed lights on the connection between AGN activity and host galaxy evolution. With the improved poststarburst selection method, I identified poststarburst samples in both the SDSS and DEEP2 survey datasets. Based on measurements of the overdensity of galaxies around each object, we find that poststarburst galaxies at both cosmic epochs prefer underdense environments even more strongly than star-forming galaxies. Cluster-specific formation mechanisms for poststarbursts cannot be dominant. Mergers involving gas-rich galaxies, instead, are a likely mechanism. The different environment distributions of poststarbursts and red sequence galaxies also suggest poststarburst phase is not the only evolutionary route towards the red sequence population., Recent observations of early X-ray afterglows of GRBs by the Swift satellite - prior to t ~ 103s but well after the end of the burst - show most GRBs to be followed by highly time and energy variable emission. This was unexpected prior to Swift and physical mechanisms remain largely mysterious. The spectra exhibit a strong hard-to-soft evolution which tracks the flux, consistent with a well-established hardness intensity correlation for the prompt Gamma-ray emission. The light curves show dramatic flares or rapid logarithmic time decays. In the simplest interpretation, this emission is GRB-like and indicates a long lived energy source with the possibility of interacting shells of widely varying bulk Lorentz factor. We review the phenomenology in order to ascertain how GLAST observations of this early emission, either detected directly or through the detection of inverse-Compton emission, can help to rule on possible models., In the past year, there have been striking changes in Jupiter's atmosphere. Among these are the Oval BA's change from white to red, two new dark Disturbances in the southern hemisphere, and a 30% change {since 1997} in the aspect ratio of the potential vorticity anomaly of the GRS {not just its associated clouds}, as we determined from high-accuracy velocities extracted from HST images. The determination of high-accuracy velocities requires both high-resolution imaging by HST {or flybys}, and our novel adaptation of Correlation Image Velocimetry {CIV}, a technique that has far greater accuracy than the traditional method {of identifying velocity tie-points by hand}. Our proposed observations will test the hypothesis that these changes in Jupiter validate our 2004 prediction: that the merger of the 3 White Ovals in 1998-2000 would lead to climate change on Jupiter. The key is to determine, by indirect means, the temperature at the base of the weather layer, a quantity that cannot be observed directly at any wavelength. The new Red Oval BA's velocities will be used to test our finding that the color change is due to global temperature changes. The change in the GRS's aspect ratio suggests a large {at least 20%} change in the shear of the local velocity since 1997. The latter can be investigated only by determining Jupiter's current zonal winds., The Advanced Compton Telescope (ACT), NASA's next major step in gamma-ray astronomy, will probe the fires where chemical elements are formed by enabling high-resolution spectroscopy of nuclear emission from supernova explosions. During the past several years, our collaboration has been undertaking a NASA mission concept study for ACT. This study was designed to (1) transform the key scientific objectives into specific instrument requirements, (2) to identify the most promising technologies to meet those requirements, and (3) to design a viable mission concept for this instrument. We will present the results of this study, including scientific goals, instrument design, and mission requirements., We use high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy from Keck Observatory to measure the stellar velocity dispersions of 19 super star clusters (SSCs) in the nuclear starburst of M82. The clusters have ages on the order of 10 Myr, which is many times longer than the crossing times implied by their velocity dispersions and radii. We therefore apply the virial theorem to derive the kinematic mass for 15 of the SSCs. The SSCs have masses of 2×10<SUP>5</SUP> to 4×10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>, with a total population mass of 1.4×10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>. Comparison of the loci of the young M82 SSCs and old Milky Way globular clusters in a plot of radius versus velocity dispersion suggests that the SSCs are a population of potential globular clusters. We present the mass function for the SSCs and find a power-law fit with an index of γ=-1.91+/-0.06. This result is nearly identical to the mass function of young SSCs in the Antennae galaxies. <P />Based on observations made at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation., Photoionization heating from UV radiation incident on the atmospheres of hot Jupiters drives planetary mass loss in the form of hydrodynamic winds. HST STIS observations of HD 209458b, the first hot Jupiter discovered to transit its host star, have confirmed that the planet is losing atomic hydrogen {Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003} and have suggested that it may be losing OI and CII {Vidal-Madjar et al. 2004}. These observations, which can be repeated with the advent of the HST Cosmic Origins Spectrograph {COS}, do not necessarily imply loss of gas at a rate large enough to significantly reduce the mass of the planet. HST STIS observations indicating a population of hydrogen in the n=2 state constrain the structure of the planet's escaping atmosphere {Ballester et al. 2007}. We propose to construct a model of mass loss from hot Jupiter atmospheres, including realistic heating and cooling, ionization balance, tidal gravity, and pressure-confinement by the stellar wind. We have already constructed a model that resolves the atmosphere's transition from atomic to ionized hydrogen. In our proposed work, we plan to also resolve the transition from molecular to atomic hydrogen. We will employ ray-tracing through our model to explain the HST STIS detections of Lyman alpha and Balmer continuum absorption by neutral hydrogen in an extended atmosphere around HD 209458b, and we will experiment with metal chemistry and vertical mixing in an attempt to reproduce the HST STIS measurement of OI and CII. Our work will provide predictions for future COS measurements. We will infer the correct mass loss rate implied by the Vidal-Madjar et al. {2003} observation and search for new observational diagnostics of hot Jupiter atmospheres., We compare hard X-ray (HXR) photon spectra observed by the RHESSI with the spectra of the electrons in the associated solar impulsive particle events observed near 1 AU by the WIND 3D Plasma and Energetic Particle (3DP) instrument. For prompt events, where the inferred injection time at the Sun coincides with the HXR burst, the HXR photon power-law spectral index γ and the in situ observed electron spectral index δ measured above 50 keV show a good linear fit, δ=γ+0.1(+/-0.1), with correlation coefficient of 0.83, while for delayed events (inferred injection &gt;10 minutes after the HXR burst) only a weak correlation with a coefficient of 0.43 is seen. The observed relationship for prompt events is inconsistent, however, with both the thin target case, where the escaping electrons come from the X-ray-producing electron population, and the thick target case where some of the accelerated source population escapes to 1 AU and the rest produce the HXRs while losing all their energy to collisions. Furthermore, the derived total number of escaping electrons correlates with the number of electrons required to produce observed X-ray flux but is only about ~0.2% of the number of HXR-producing electrons., We show that the ratio of observed annual-mean land temperature change to ocean surface temperature change, $\phi$, has remained almost constant during 1955-2003. This is the case, despite most of the heat capacity of the climate system lying in the oceans, and rapid variations in climate forcing. Examining seven General Circulation Models (GCMs), we find land and ocean temperature behavior comparable to observations in six cases. For three models that reproduce observed $\phi$ and for which we have data, we find no significant changes in future $\phi$ under the SRES A1B scenario. We suggest that variations in land-ocean heat flux primarily balanced by ocean heat uptake are sufficient to maintain constant $\phi$. This flux is present in the six GCMs that resemble observations, suggesting that observed $\phi$ may remain constant into the future, even if radiative forcing is markedly different than in the past., There is little agreement regarding the importance of anelastic contributions to the temperature dependence of seismic wave velocities. Some studies consider the anelastic contribution to be negligible, whereas others argue that it may be as important as the purely elastic contribution. In order to evaluate these claims, we review physically plausible models for mantle relaxation processes and construct a model of activation enthalpy based on solid state physics as well as on recent experimental results. We then deduce self-consistent 1-D Q profiles and evaluate the anelastic contribution to the temperature dependence of V<SUB>s</SUB> and V<SUB>p</SUB>. Physically plausible values of activation enthalpies yield anelastic contributions that increase with depth and account for at least 20% of the velocity temperature derivatives at 2600 km. We show that anelasticity may significantly moderate temperature variations in hot (slow velocity) zones. This suggests that inferred lateral changes in temperature, as well as arguments regarding the presence of chemical heterogeneity, and/or temperature induced phase transformations, are likely to be significantly affected by anelastic effects in the mantle. We also compute values of the dimensionless parameters R<SUB>s/ p</SUB>, R<SUB>ϕ/ s</SUB>, and R<SUB>ρ/ s</SUB>. We find that anelasticity can either increase or decrease R<SUB>s/ p</SUB>, but the magnitude of the correction, of the order of 15%, is smaller than the uncertainty in the elastic value. Anelasticity cannot change the sign of R<SUB>ϕ/ s</SUB> and R<SUB>ρ/ s</SUB>, but it can decrease their values by as much as 50%. However, given current uncertainties in seismic and mineral data, the effects of anelasticity on the dimensionless parameters do not bring any quantitative constraints on lateral variations of temperature, chemical composition and/or mineral phase., Observations over the past two solar cycles show a highly irregular pattern of occurrence for major solar flares, γ-ray events, and solar energetic particle (SEP) fluences. Such phenomena do not appear to follow the direct indices of solar magnetic activity, such as the sunspot number. I show that this results from the non-Poisson occurrence for the most energetic events. This Letter also points out a particularly striking example of this irregularity in a comparison between the declining phases of the recent two solar cycles (1993-1995 and 2004-2006, respectively) and traces it through the radiated energies of the flares, the associated SEP fluences, and the sunspot areas. These factors suggest that processes in the solar interior involved with the supply of magnetic flux up to the surface of the Sun have strong correlations in space and time, leading to a complex occurrence pattern that is presently unpredictable on timescales longer than active region lifetimes (weeks) and not correlated well with the solar cycle itself., The X-ray transient 4U 1730-22 has not been detected in outburst since 1972, when a single ~200 day outburst was detected by the Uhuru satellite. This neutron star or black hole X-ray binary is presumably in quiescence now, and here we report on X-ray and optical observations of the 4U 1730-22 field designed to identify the system's quiescent counterpart. Using the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we have found a very likely counterpart. The candidate counterpart, CXOU J173357.5-220156, is close to the center of the Uhuru error region and has a thermal spectrum. The 0.3-8 keV spectrum is well described by a neutron star atmosphere model with an effective temperature of 131+/-21 eV. For a neutron star with a 10 km radius, the implied source distance is 10<SUP>+12</SUP><SUB>-4</SUB> kpc, and the X-ray luminosity is 1.9×10<SUP>33</SUP> (d/10 kpc)<SUP>2</SUP> ergs s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Accretion from a companion star is likely required to maintain the temperature of this neutron star, which would imply that it is an X-ray binary, and therefore almost certainly the 4U 1730-22 counterpart. We do not detect an optical source at the position of the Chandra source down to R&gt;22.1, and this is consistent with the system being a low-mass X-ray binary at a distance greater than a few kpc. If our identification is correct, 4U 1730-22 is one of the 5 most luminous of the 20 neutron star transients that have quiescent X-ray luminosity measurements. We discuss the results in the context of neutron star cooling and the comparison between neutron stars and black holes in quiescence., We present in situ measurements in a space plasma showing that thin current sheets the size of an ion inertial length exist and are abundant in strong and intermittent plasma turbulence. Many of these current sheets exhibit the microphysical signatures of reconnection. The spatial scale where intermittency occurs corresponds to the observed structures. The reconnecting current sheets represent a type of dissipation mechanism, with observed dissipation rates comparable to or even dominating over collisionless damping rates of waves at ion inertial length scales (×100), and can have far reaching implications for small-scale dissipation in all turbulent plasmas., The Kaplan Manohar ambiguity in light quark masses allows for a larger uncertainty in the ratio of up to down quark masses than naive estimates from the chiral Lagrangian would indicate. We show that it allows for a relaxation of experimental bounds on the quantum chromodynamics axion; specifically Kim Shifman Vainshtein Zakharov axions in the 2 3 µeV mass range composing 100% of the galactic dark matter halo can evade the experimental limits placed by the ADMX collaboration., We report simultaneous multicolor near-infrared (NIR) observations of the supernova associated with X-ray flash 060218 during the first 16 days after the high-energy event. We find that the light curve rises and peaks relatively fast compared to other Type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic), with the characteristic broad NIR peak seen in all three bands. We find that the rise profile before the peak is largely independent of NIR wavelength, each band appearing to transition into a plateau phase around day 10-13. Since the light curve is in the plateau phase when our observations end at day 16, we can only place limits on the peak absolute magnitudes, but we estimate that SN 2006aj is one of the lowest NIR luminosity X-ray flash/gamma-ray burst (XRF/GRB) associated SNe observed to date. The broad peaks observed in the JHK<SUB>s</SUB> bands point to a large increase in the NIR contribution of the total flux output from days 10-16. This evolution can be seen in the broad color and spectral energy distribution diagrams constructed using UBVRIJHK<SUB>s</SUB> monochromatic flux measurements for the first 16 days of the event. Ultimately, a 10 day rise time would make SN 2006aj an extremely fast rise SN Ic event, faster than SN 1998bw and SN 2003dh, which combined with its underluminous nature indicates a lower amount of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni ejected by the progenitor compared to other XRF/GRB-SNe. Furthermore, the lack of significant color change during the rise portion of the burst points to little or no spectral evolution over the first 10 days of activity in the NIR., We measured concentrations of cosmogenic <SUP>41</SUP>Ca in 37 diogenites, including 8 falls and 29 Antarctic finds, using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). The measured <SUP>41</SUP>Ca concentrations in falls range from 2.8 to 9.3 dpm/kg, those in Antarctic finds range from 1.6 to 28 dpm/kg. The <SUP>41</SUP>Ca concentrations in four of the falls agree within 10% with estimated saturation values based on spallation from Ti, Cr, Mn and the main target element, Fe. Four other diogenite falls and several Antarctic finds show elevated <SUP>41</SUP>Ca concentrations, which are attributed to capture of thermal neutrons on <SUP>40</SUP>Ca. The neutron-capture <SUP>41</SUP>Ca contributions range from 0.1 to 1.5 dpm/g Ca. Monte Carlo based model calculations show that contributions of neutron-capture <SUP>41</SUP>Ca are negligible (&lt;0.05 dpm/g Ca) in diogenites with pre-atmospheric radii &lt;20 cm, but become dominant in diogenites larger than 30 cm in radius and reach a maximum value of ∼5.6 dpm/g Ca in the center of objects with radii of 80 100 cm. The contributions of neutron-capture <SUP>41</SUP>Ca in diogenites were used to constrain their pre-atmospheric radii. Many Antarctic diogenites show low <SUP>41</SUP>Ca concentrations, up to 60% below the saturation value determined for falls. From these low <SUP>41</SUP>Ca concentrations we derive terrestrial ages up to ∼135 kyr. We compare these terrestrial ages with those of other Antarctic achondrites and Antarctic chondrites and discuss the role of terrestrial weathering in limiting the lifetime of meteorites falling in different environments, i.e. Antarctic versus hot desert conditions., The accelerating expansion of the Universe presents an exciting, fundamental challenge to the standard models of particle physics and cosmology. I highlight some of the outstanding challenges in both developing theoretical models and interpreting without bias the observational results from precision cosmology experiments in the next decade that will return data to help reveal the nature of the new physics. Examples given focus on distinguishing a new component of energy from a new law of gravity, and the effect of early dark energy on baryon acoustic oscillations., When Bernard Lyot presented the first movie of solar prominences to the IAU in 1938, the audience of astronomers must have appreciated the following: through a feasible technical innovation, scientists could routinely study a known phenomenon through direct imaging. Yet, beyond their imagination was the fact that a small modification to the Lyot coronagraph would reveal new faint moons and rings of the Jovian planets, and the debris disk of Beta Pic. During a 1994 conference in Paris, Brad Smith noted how he verified the disk-like nebulosity at the 2.5-m Las Campanas telescope without the help of a CCD: I decided to look for it [the Beta Pic disk] visually in the eyepiece using transfer optics and a hastily rigged coronagraphic mask. I could see it very clearly! The disk was certainly real. Why were these latter discoveries made in the 1980's instead of the 1930's? It seems that even though Lyot had made a breakthrough with respect to solar observations, the community did not make a sufficient connection with the great French astronomer to realize the full scientific potential of his coronagraph. So what are we missing today? By bringing together instrumentalists and research astronomers, the goal of the Spirit of Lyot Conference is to maximize the scientific gains that are possible with today's state-of-the-art technologies., The measured masses and orbits of the 185 known exoplanets within 200 pc provide information on the formation and dynamics of planetary systems. Multiple-planet systems, especially those in resonances, contain rich information on migration, scattering, and capture. Some old theories of planet formation survive, but many new processes have emerged as important. A new domain of planets from 1-14 Earth masses, not found in our Solar System, is becoming accessible observationally, with several detections in hand. The formation and possible final structures of rocky and rock-ice planets may yield more diversity than currently imagined. The Kepler Mission and a new 2.4-m Automated Planet Finder telescope at Lick Obs. portend the detection of rocky planets around other stars., Direct identification of the progenitors of supernovae (SNe) is rare because of the required spatial resolution and depth of the archival data prior to the SN explosions. Here we report on the identification of the progenitors of two nearby SNe in the Virgo Cluster: SN 2006my in NGC 4651 and SN 2006ov in M61. We obtained high-quality ground-based images of SN 2006my with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, and are able to locate the site of the SN on pre-SN Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 images to a high precision (1 σ uncertainty of +/-0.05""). We pinpoint the site of SN 2006ov to within 0.02"" from HST Advanced Camera for Surveys images of the SN. We detected a red supergiant progenitor for each SN within the error circles, with an inferred zero-age main-sequence mass (M<SUB>zams</SUB>) of 10<SUP>+5</SUP><SUB>-3</SUB> and 15<SUP>+5</SUP><SUB>-3</SUB> M<SUB>solar</SUB> for the progenitors of SNe 2006my and 2006ov, respectively. The mass estimates for the progenitors of both SNe confirm a suggested trend that the most common Type II-plateau SNe originate from low-mass supergiants with M<SUB>zams</SUB>~8-20 M<SUB>solar</SUB>. <P />Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with program GO-10877. <P />Based on observations obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institute National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France, and the University of Hawaii., Galactic cosmic rays probably predominantly originate from shock-accelerated gas and dust in superbubbles. It is usually assumed that the shock-accelerated dust is quickly destroyed by sputtering. However, it may be that some of the dust can survive bombardment by the high-metallicity gas in the superbubble interior, and that some of that dust has been incorporated into solar system materials. Interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) contain enigmatic submicron components called GEMS (Glass with Embedded Metal and Sulfides). These GEMS have properties that closely match those expected of a population of surviving shock-accelerated dust at the GCR source (Westphal and Bradley in Astrophys. J. 617:1131, 2004). In order to test the hypothesis that GEMS are synthesized from shock-accelerated dust in superbubbles, we plan to measure the relative abundances of Fe, Zr, and Mo isotopes in GEMS using the new Resonance Ionization Mass Spectrometer at Argonne National Laboratory. If GEMS are synthesized from shock-accelerated dust in superbubbles, they should exhibit isotopic anomalies in Fe, Zr and Mo: specificially, enhancements in the r-only isotopes <SUP>96</SUP>Zr and <SUP>100</SUP>Mo, and separately in <SUP>58</SUP>Fe, should be observed. We review also recent developments in observations of GEMS, laboratory synthesis of GEMS-like materials, and implications of observations of GEMS-like materials in Stardust samples., We present adaptive optics (AO) images of the central starburst region of the dwarf irregular galaxy IC 10. The Keck II telescope laser guide star was used to achieve near diffraction-limited performance at H and K<SUP>'</SUP> (Strehl ratios of 18% and 32%, respectively). The images are centered on the putative Wolf-Rayet (W-R) object [MAC92]24. We combine our AO images with F814W data from HST. By comparing the K<SUP>'</SUP> versus [F814W]-K<SUP>'</SUP> color-magnitude diagram (CMD) with theoretical isochrones, we find that the stellar population is best represented by at least two bursts of star formation, one ~10 Myr ago and one much older (150-500 Myr). Young, blue stars are concentrated in the vicinity of [MAC92]24. This population represents an OB association with a half-light radius of about 3 pc. We resolve the W-R object [MAC92] 24 into at least six blue stars. Four of these components have near-IR colors and luminosities that make them robust WN star candidates. By matching the location of C stars in the CMD with those in the SMC we derive a distance modulus for IC 10 of about 24.5 mag and a foreground reddening of E(B-V)=0.95 mag. We find a more precise distance by locating the tip of the giant branch in the F814W, H, and K<SUP>'</SUP> luminosity functions. We find a weighted mean distance modulus of 24.48+/-0.08. The systematic error in this measurement, due to a possible difference in the properties of the RGB populations in IC 10 and the SMC, is +/-0.16 mag., We argue that the X-ray and UV flux illuminating the parsec-scale accretion disk around luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is super-Eddington with respect to the local far-infrared dust opacity. The far-infrared opacity may be larger than in the interstellar medium of the Milky Way due to a combination of supersolar metallicity and the growth of dust grains in the dense accretion disk. Because of the irradiating flux, the outer accretion disk puffs up with a vertical thickness h~R. This provides a mechanism for generating a geometrically thick obscuring region from an intrinsically thin disk. We find obscuring columns ~10<SUP>22</SUP>-10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, in reasonable agreement with observations., Using an electron transport model, we investigate the effect of electron precipitation on the electron density and total electron content in the nightside ionosphere of Mars. As input we use Mars Global Surveyor observations of a typical tail electron spectrum and an auroral-like electron spectrum. The accelerated electron spectrum increases the maximum number density and total electron content by a factor of 3 over that produced by the typical tail spectrum. Our calculations show a secondary electron density peak due to precipitation of several keV electrons not seen in previous modeling efforts. Regions of enhanced ionization are expected to be localized in space, corresponding to magnetic cusps formed by the interaction of crustal sources with the interplanetary magnetic field. Radio and radar measurements from both Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Express agree with this expectation. The horizontally inhomogeneous regions of ionization can affect signals used for subsurface sounding from orbit., A key feature of collisionless magnetic reconnection is the formation of Hall magnetic and electric field structure in the vicinity of the diffusion region. Here we present multi-point Cluster observations of a reconnection event in the near-Earth magnetotail where the diffusion region was nested by the Cluster spacecraft; we compare observations made simultaneously by different spacecraft on opposite sides of the magnetotail current sheet. This allows the spatial structure of both the electric and magnetic field to be probed. It is found that, close to the diffusion region, the magnetic field displays a symmetric quadrupole structure. The Hall electric field is symmetric, observed to be inwardly directed on both sides of the current sheet. It is large (∼40 mV m<SUP>-1</SUP>) on the earthward side of the diffusion region, but substantially weaker on the tailward side, suggesting a reduced reconnection rate reflected by a similar reduction in E<SUB>y</SUB>. A small-scale magnetic flux rope was observed in conjunction with these observations. This flux rope, observed very close to the reconnection site and entrained in the plasma flow, may correspond to what have been termed secondary islands in computer simulations. The core magnetic field inside the flux rope is enhanced by a factor of 3, even though the lobe guide field is negligible. Observations of the electric field inside the magnetic island show extremely strong (∼100 mV m<SUP>-1</SUP>) fields which may play a significant role in the particle dynamics during reconnection., We present an extinction map of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), using 204,502 stars from the Two Micron All-Sky Survey point-source catalog. We first use the NICE method to determine the reddening distribution, E(H-K) and E(J-H), which we compare to the H I distribution to find a near-infrared reddening law of E(J-H)/E(H-K)=1.20+/-0.04. A visual extinction map (~6<SUP>deg</SUP>×6<SUP>deg</SUP>) of the LMC is created using the NICER method; at 4' resolution, a mean value of A<SUB>V</SUB>=0.3 mag is found. We derive the LMC CO-to-H<SUB>2</SUB> conversion factor, X<SUB>LMC</SUB>, independent of assumptions about the virialization of giant molecular clouds, by comparing the NICER extinction map with NANTEN <SUP>12</SUP>CO observations. In regions where A<SUB>V</SUB>&gt;1 mag and <SUP>12</SUP>CO emission is &gt;=2 K km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, we measure X<SUB>LMC</SUB>=9.3+/-0.4×10<SUP>20</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> (K km s<SUP>-1</SUP>)<SUP>-1</SUP>. In the same regions, the LMC contains a total molecular mass of (4.5+/-0.2)×10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>., In Bousso-Polchinski models with hundreds of fluxes, we compute the effects of cosmological dynamics on the probability distribution of landscape vacua. Starting from generic initial conditions, we find that most fluxes are dynamically driven into a different and much narrower range of values than expected from landscape statistics alone. Hence, cosmological evolution will access only a tiny fraction of the vacua with small cosmological constant. This leads to a host of sharp predictions. Unlike other approaches to eternal inflation, the holographic measure employed here does not lead to staggering, an excessive spread of probabilities that would doom the string landscape as a solution to the cosmological constant problem., A suite of observations suggests that the northern plains of Mars, which cover nearly one third of the planet's surface, may once have contained an ocean. Perhaps the most provocative evidence for an ancient ocean is a set of surface features that ring the plains for thousands of kilometres and that have been interpreted as a series of palaeoshorelines of different age. It has been shown, however, that topographic profiles along the putative shorelines contain long-wavelength trends with amplitudes of up to several kilometres, and these trends have been taken as an argument against the martian shoreline (and ocean) hypothesis. Here we show that the long-wavelength topography of the shorelines is consistent with deformation caused by true polar wander-a change in the orientation of a planet with respect to its rotation pole-and that the inferred pole path has the geometry expected for a true polar wander event that postdates the formation of the massive Tharsis volcanic rise., Remanent crustal magnetic fields such as those found on the Moon, Mars, and possibly asteroids provide us with a unique space physics laboratory. Lunar crustal sources in particular allow us to explore direct solar wind interaction with magnetic obstacles of varying scale sizes. This interaction shares many features with a global magnetosphere, with various types of waves generated by charged particles interacting with magnetic field obstacles. For small electron-scale obstacles, a ""whistler wake"" can form, with waves similar to the ""One Hz"" waves commonly observed upstream from a global magnetosphere. Larger obstacles can generate ion-scale (magnetosonic) waves which can steepen to form shocks upstream from the magnetic obstacle, analogous to the bow shock of a global magnetosphere. Presumably, for a large enough crustal magnetic source, a full magnetosphere could be produced, with bow shock, magnetopause, etc. However, from a fundamental space physics perspective, perhaps the most interesting regime is that transitional between electron and ion scales, where electrons and ions likely decouple and kinetic behavior may prove most important. This transitional regime (which may be analogous in some ways to the reconnection diffusion region) is not well understood, and will require careful observations with a complete suite of particle and fields instrumentation - in concert with modern simulation techniques - to fully unravel., STEREO multipoint measurements of the solar wind structure with the IMPACT and PLASTIC investigations, near Earth but off the Sun-Earth line, allow its sources and structure to be examined at solar minimum when such studies are particularly straightforward. With the aid of 3D models of the heliosphere available at the CCMC, we map the in-situ observations to their solar sources using a combination of the open field regions inferred from the SECCHI EUVI imagers and SOHO EIT, and the magnetogram-based models of the corona and solar wind. Our ultimate goal is the continuous tracking of solar wind source regions as the STEREO mission progresses, as well as the use of the mappings to deduce the distinctive properties of solar wind from different types of sources, The giant flare of 2004 December 27 from SGR 1806-20 represents one of the most extraordinary events captured in over three decades of monitoring the γ-ray sky. One measure of the intensity of the main peak is its effect on X- and γ-ray instruments. RHESSI, an instrument designed to study the brightest solar flares, was completely saturated for ~0.5 s following the start of the main peak. A fortuitous alignment of SGR 1806-20 near the Sun at the time of the giant flare, however, allowed RHESSI a unique view of the giant flare event, including the precursor, the main-peak decay, and the pulsed tail. Since RHESSI was saturated during the main peak, we augment these observations with Wind and RHESSI particle detector data in order to reconstruct the main peak as well. Here we present detailed spectral analysis and evolution of the giant flare. We report the identification of a relatively soft fast peak just milliseconds before the main peak, whose timescale and size scale indicate a magnetospheric origin. We present the novel detection of emission extending up to 17 MeV immediately following the main peak, perhaps revealing a highly extended corona driven by the hyper-Eddington luminosities. The spectral evolution and pulse evolution during the tail are presented, demonstrating significant magnetospheric twist during this phase, but no apparent magnetospheric evolution. Blackbody radii are derived for every stage of the flare, which show remarkable agreement despite the range of luminosities and temperatures covered. Finally, we confirm the existence of a hard afterglow emission extending up to 2.5 MeV in the hundreds of seconds following the giant flare., Recent observations suggest that dissipationless mergers of elliptical galaxies build up the population of massive early-type galaxies (Bell et al. 2004; Faber et al. 2006). This type of merger is observed in galaxy clusters (Tran et al. 2005) and predicted by semi-analytic models which find mass assembly times significantly later than star-formation times for the most massive elliptical galaxies (de Lucia &amp; Blaizot 2006). Here, we use a semi-analytic model of minor mergers of dark matter halos to examine the role of dry minor mergers in elliptical galaxy formation., We present early measurements by the STEREO/WAVES and IMPACT instruments of bow shocks, interplanetary shocks, and in situ interplanetary type III bursts. S/WAVES measures spectral density and 'burst' electric waveforms on three orthogonal antennas. IMPACT burst mode samples the thermal and suprathermal electrons and magnetic field at high cadence for several 10 minute intervals each day. The S/WAVES and IMPACT bursts systems have triggered together on several occasions at shocks and foreshock electron beams. Here we present results of these high time resolution bursts. Early in the mission, several in situ IP type III bursts were observed at 1 AU by STEREO and Wind. The similar instrumentation on the three spacecraft (with separations greater than 100 Re) allows us to limit the spatial extent of the type III radio emission region., The hypothesis that ionospheric conductivity plays a major role in the global-scale dynamics of the aurora is further evaluated in this study. The substorm recovery time scale during auroral intensifications are computed for over three hundred substorms observed by the Polar Ultraviolet Imager (UVI) and the IMAGE Far Ultraviolet Imager (FUV) in both hemispheres and then sorted according to season. The substorm recovery times are well ordered by whether or not the nightside auroral region is sunlit: substorms occurring in the winter and equinox periods have similar recovery time scales which are both roughly a factor of two longer than that for summer when the auroral oval is sunlit. These results strongly suggest that simultaneous auroral intensifications in the northern and southern hemispheres develop differently during solstice conditions. We expect the auroral breakup in the dark (winter) hemisphere to be more intense and longer lived than that observed in the sunlit (summer) hemisphere. This also implies that more energy is deposited by electron precipitation in the winter hemisphere than in the summer one during a substorm. Simultaneous, conjugate auroral substorm observations by Polar UVI and the IMAGE FUV instrument are used to confirm this behavior. The observed hemispheric asymmetry and non-conjugacy of auroral substorms is consistent with the suppression of discrete aurora in sunlight and highlights the importance of this effect in magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling., Ions accelerated in solar flares interact with the solar atmosphere to produce gamma-ray lines and neutrons. Some of the neutrons that escape from the Sun into interplanetary space can survive to the Earth and be observed both by satellite detectors and by ground-based neutron detectors. Observations of these gamma-rays and neutrons provide information about acceleration and transport of ions in solar flares. There were three solar neutron events observed by the ground-based neutron monitors in association with large solar flares on 1991 June 4, 2003 October 28, and 2005 September 7. In these events, intense gamma-ray emission, including gamma-ray lines at 0.511, 2.2, 4.4, 6.1 MeV and evidence for pion-decay radiation, was observed by the satellites. The 1991 June 4 event was observed by the CGRO/OSSE, and the 2003 October 28 and 2005 September 7 events were observed by the INTEGRAL and RHESSI satellites. Based on these gamma-ray line observations, we calculate predicted time-dependent neutron spectra arriving at Earth using the solar flare magnetic loop transport and interaction model of Hua et al. (2002). These spectra are then convolved with the response functions of the Earth's atmosphere and the neutron monitor to provide predicted neutron monitor count rates. We compare these predicted and observed rates to determine the accelerated ion spectrum and magnetic-loop transport properties., We present results from a global 3-D nonlinear simulation of magnetic dynamo action achieved by solar convection in a penetrative geometry. We include within the spherical computational domain both the bulk of the convection zone and a portion of the underlying stable layer. A tachocline of rotational shear is realized below the convection zone, where we have imposed both a hydrodynamic drag term and small thermal perturbations consistent with thermal wind balance. Thus we are capturing many of the dynamical elements thought to be essential in the operation of the global solar dynamo, including differential rotation arising from convection, magnetic pumping, and the stretching and amplification of toroidal fields within the tachocline. In the stable region, the simulation reveals that strong axisymmetric toroidal magnetic fields (about 3000 G in strength) are realized, in contrast to the mostly fluctuating fields that predominate in the convection zone. The toroidal fields in the stable region exhibit a striking antisymmetric parity akin to that observed in sunspots, with fields in the northern hemisphere largely of the opposite sign to those in the southern hemisphere. These deep toroidal fields are accompanied by mostly dipolar mean poloidal fields, whose polarity has retained the same sense over multiple years of simulated evolution., We present a 200 ks Chandra observation of seven spectroscopically selected, high-redshift (0.75&lt;z&lt;1.03) galaxy groups and clusters discovered by the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey in the Extended Groth Strip. X-ray emission at the locations of these systems is consistent with background. The 3 σ upper limits on the bolometric X-ray luminosities (L<SUB>X</SUB>) of these systems put a strong constraint on the relation between L<SUB>X</SUB> and the velocity dispersion of member galaxies σ<SUB>gal</SUB> at z~1 the DEEP2 systems have lower luminosity than would be predicted by the local relation. Our result is consistent with recent findings that at high redshift, optically selected clusters tend to be X-ray-underluminous. A comparison with mock catalogs indicates that it is unlikely that this effect is entirely caused by a measurement bias between σ<SUB>gal</SUB> and the dark matter velocity dispersion. Physically, the DEEP2 systems may still be in the process of forming and hence not fully virialized, or they may be deficient in hot gas compared to local systems. We find only one possibly extended source in this Chandra field, which happens to lie outside the DEEP2 coverage., We analyse the Fundamental Plane projections of elliptical galaxies as a function of luminosity, using a sample of ~80000 galaxies drawn from Data Release 4 (DR4) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We separate brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) from our main sample and reanalyse their photometry due to a problem with the default pipeline sky subtraction for BCGs. The observables we consider are effective radius (R<SUB>e</SUB>), velocity dispersion (σ), dynamical mass (M<SUB>dyn</SUB> ~ R<SUB>e</SUB>σ<SUP>2</SUP>), effective density (σ<SUP>2</SUP>/R<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>e</SUB>) and effective surface brightness (μ<SUB>e</SUB>). With the exception of the L -M<SUB>dyn</SUB> correlation, we find evidence of variations in the slope (i.e. the power-law index) of the Fundamental Plane projections with luminosity for our normal elliptical galaxy population. In particular, the radius-luminosity and Faber-Jackson relations are steeper at high luminosity relative to low luminosity, and the more luminous ellipticals become progressively less dense and have lower surface brightnesses than lower luminosity ellipticals. These variations can be understood as arising from differing formation histories, with more luminous galaxies having less dissipation. Data from the literature and our reanalysis of BCGs show that BCGs have radius-luminosity and Faber-Jackson relations steeper than the brightest non-BCG ellipticals in our sample, consistent with significant growth of BCGs via dissipationless mergers. The variations in slope we find in the Faber-Jackson relation of non-BCGs are qualitatively similar to that reported in the black hole mass-velocity dispersion (M<SUB>BH</SUB>-σ) correlation. This similarity is consistent with a roughly constant value of M<SUB>BH</SUB>/M<SUB>*</SUB> over a wide range of early-type galaxies, where M<SUB>*</SUB> is the stellar mass., Although the Moon and asteroids are often thought of as having relatively dormant environments, in fact the Moon at least is very electrically active. The surfaces of airless bodies are directly exposed to solar UV and X-rays, as well as solar wind plasma and energetic particles. This bombardment creates a complex electric field and plasma environment, with the surface typically charging positive in sunlight and negative in shadow, and surface potentials varying over orders of magnitude in response to changing solar illumination and plasma conditions. We present the first efforts to derive the exact magnitude of the nightside lunar surface electric potential from orbit (which involves correcting for spacecraft charging effects), rather than the lower limits which have been derived before. We then compare these measurements to simple theoretical models and other predictions for lunar surface charging in shadow during quiet times. In addition, we present a complete survey of lunar surface charging (utilizing data from Apollo surface observations and Lunar Prospector orbital observations, in concert with theory and modeling) for all lunar locations and solar and plasma conditions, in order to demonstrate the wide range of charging conditions that can occur on airless bodies. By validating surface charging models for the Moon, we can gain confidence in the application of these models to other airless bodies such as asteroids, moons, and Mercury. It is important to have confidence in these theoretical tools, so we can apply them to problems such as dust levitation and transport - which may be of fundamental importance both at the Moon and on asteroids., Using an electron transport model, we investigate the effect of ionization due to electron precipitation on the electron density and total electron content in the nightside ionosphere of Mars. As input we use typical tail electron spectra and recently reported auroral-like peaked electron spectra that appear to have undergone an acceleration process. The accelerated electron spectra increase the maximum number density and total electron content by nearly a factor of 3 over that produced by typical tail spectra. The regions of enhanced ionization are localized in space and correspond to magnetic cusps formed by the interaction of the Martian crustal sources with the interplanetary magnetic field. We find that our modeled peak ion production rates are several times less than previous calculations and that our calculated maximum ionospheric electron densities are less than recent observations. The main source of the discrepancy between our results and previous work appears to arise from differences in the neutral atmosphere profile. The upper atmosphere of Mars changes significantly with season and solar cycle. Likewise, peak ionization rates and maximum ionospheric electron number densities can also change significantly, with these quantities being minimum for conditions of large atmospheric scale heights; however, the thickness of the ionospheric layer is greatest under these conditions leading to a small net change in total electron content., Ions accelerated in solar flares interact with the ambient atmosphere to produce not only the prompt gamma-ray line emission that has been observed in many flares, but also radioactive nuclei with long half-lives. The most notable of these nuclei is Co-56, which has a half-life of 78.8 days and upon decay produces very narrow lines at 847 keV and 1.238 MeV. Due to the long half-life of Co-56, the radioactive material will accumulate over multiple flares and persist over many weeks. The initial fluxes seen in these lines can constrain models of ion acceleration in flares in a similar way to fluxes of the prompt lines. More importantly, their decay profile with time would provide an absolutely new probe -- a radioactive tracer -- of the mixing of material from the chromosphere and upper photosphere to greater depths. The high-resolution spectral capabilities of the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) provide the best opportunity to date for detecting such lines above the background. We present the latest upper limits obtained in our search for the lines from these long-lived radioactive nuclei. <P />The work at the University of California, Berkeley, was supported by NASA grant NNG05GI89G., Large (≤ 600 mV/m) perpendicular and parallel electric fields were measured in the Earth's bow shock for the first time by the vector electric field experiment on the Polar Satellite. These fields exist on spatial scales comparable to or less than the electron skin depth (a few kilometers) and they contain parallel potentials of tens of volts and perpendicular potentials up to a kilovolt. We discuss these results in the context of electron kinetics in the shock front., The United States has many different scientific agencies that fund research on solar science, including the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). Because there is a large population of Spanish-speaking people in the US, some of the resources developed by the education components of research projects take into account broader cultural perspectives on science and are developed in Spanish. We will describe the education and outreach programs of three solar programs funded by NASA and NSF, the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) program, the ""We Are One Under the Sun"" Program, and the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) education program. The STEREO program aims to teach about the Sun through different venues including teacher workshops and courses, teacher materials, turning solar data from STEREO into sound, working with museums, and creating solar posters, CDs, DVDs, and lenticulars. The ""We are One Under the Sun"" program focuses on Native Americans and Hispanics of Native heritage. It works by merging culture, ancient observatories, and the latest NASA solar science to engage children, youth, and the general public in science and technology through solar traditions in their own indigenous culture. The NOAO Educational Outreach Program was established to make the science and scientists of NOAO more accessible to the K-12 and college-level communities. We will focus on the NOAO solar projects and Spanish-Language Astronomy Materials Educational Center program, which provides multiple types of Spanish- language materials for teachers. These programs have had different levels of outreach in Spanish-speaking countries, namely Mexico (STEREO and ""We are One Under the Sun"") and Chile (NOAO). We will describe these efforts and give links to the Spanish and English resources available to learn and teach about the Sun., Correlations between global auroral images and in-situ measurements in the plasma sheet and magnetotail have led to many new insights into how the magnetosphere and ionospheric auroral region are coupled. Several studies have shown that intense auroral emission in the ionosphere is well correlated with plasma sheet disturbances characterized by one or more of the following: large ion velocity moments, enhancements in the energetic ion and electron fluxes, increases in plasma temperature, and high frequency fluctuations in the magnetic field. In addition global images provide unambiguous timing of auroral brightenings and direction and speed of propagation of auroral forms. The timing and propagation determined from images, in turn, can be used to put the plasma sheet observations in context. We show several examples of auroral substorms and other auroral activity observed by global auroral imagers and simultaneous, in-situ near-Earth plasma sheet plasma and magnetic field observations. We conclude that when a spacecraft in the near-Earth plasma sheet (X &lt; 20 RE) detects plasma sheet activity, it is in a region magnetically connected to intense auroral emission in the ionosphere. This implies a near Earth source (near 10 RE) and that plasma sheet disturbances propagate tailward as regions of intense auroral emission migrate poleward. This result is mostly inconsistent with the NENL model of substorm onset. Several case studies which were originally interpreted to support the NENL model are re-interpreted to be inconsistent with this model. Future refinements to the NENL model must address these inconsistencies., We present observations of electrons above the Martian night side, using data from the Mars Global Surveyor Electron Reflectometer. These electron observations allow us to investigate fundamental space physics at Mars. Electron angular distributions allow us to understand the constantly evolving Martian magnetic field topology. Energized electron distributions observed in remanent magnetic field cusps and near crossings of the induced magnetotail current sheet inform us about Martian physical processes which may be analogous to those observed in the terrestrial auroral zone, magnetospheric cusp, and plasma sheet. Anisotropic electron distributions commonly observed near the current sheet (but also in other regions) allow us to trace magnetic connectivity to the solar wind by tracking the anisotropic suprathermal electron population from the solar wind to the Martian night side (as previously demonstrated using Phobos data). Detailed investigation of electron angular and energy distributions may also allow us to investigate other fundamental space physics processes, including wave particle interactions., We report the first scattered light detection of a dusty debris disk surrounding the F2 V star HD 15115 using the Hubble Space Telescope in the optical and Keck adaptive optics in the near-infrared. The most remarkable property of the HD 15115 disk relative to other debris disks is its extreme length asymmetry. The east side of the disk is detected to ~315 AU radius, whereas the west side of the disk has radius &gt;550 AU. We find a blue optical to near-infrared scattered light color relative to the star that indicates grain scattering properties similar to the AU Mic debris disk. The existence of a large debris disk surrounding HD 15115 adds further evidence for membership in the β Pic moving group, which was previously argued based on kinematics alone. Here we hypothesize that the extreme disk asymmetry is due to dynamical perturbations from HIP 12545, an M star east of HD 15115 that shares a common proper motion vector, heliocentric distance, galactic space velocity, and age., We examine particle signatures associated with a solar wind reconnection exhaust on July 22, 1999 using experiments on the Wind satellite. The passage of the exhaust past the satellite took only 40 seconds and thus it was essential that the 3D-P instrument on Wind was operating in a `burst mode' that provides full three- dimensional particle distributions. In this work we analyze the characteristics of thermal electrons (EESA-L) and protons (PESA-L) before, during and after the exhaust. EESA-L and PESA-L measurements were first converted into units of distribution function. Then the data was transferred to the solar wind rest frame and corrected for the spacecraft potential. The observations show a proton beam coming from the direction of the X-line and increases in the electron fluxes at the exhaust boundaries. These are likely associated with the ion-acoustic and Langmuir waves identified at the exhaust boundary. Despite of the large rotation in the magnetic field direction the solar wind heat flux remained parallel to the magnetic field throughout the event implying no change in the IMF polarity., We present the latest results from a series of three-dimensional MHD simulations of the Quiet Sun magnetic field. The computational domain extends from the upper convection zone out into the corona, and includes the highly-stratified layers of the photosphere, chromosphere, and transition region. Our study focuses on the following questions: Can the magnetic field generated by a convective surface dynamo heat a model corona to soft X-ray emitting temperatures? Do physical processes such as resistive and viscous dissipation supply the necessary heating throughout the model atmosphere, or is an additional empirically-based heating mechanism required? What is the magnetic connection between the flux threading the model photosphere, and that filling the model corona? Can the magnetic field in the dynamic models be successfully reproduced by static extrapolations?, A topological difference between the classical near earth neutral line (1) and current disruption (2) substorm models is the latitude position of the open closed field line boundary (OCFB) immediately after substorm onset. In model 1 the OCFB should be near the onset point which is the location of the reconnection between open and closed field lines while in model 2 the onset and subsequent poleward expansion should take place in a regions of closed field lines and where the expansion move towards the OCFB. Data sets were examined in which a NASA FAST satellite magnetic footprint occurred within 2000 km of a substorm onset point as determined from auroral brightening in the global images obtained by the NASA IMAGE spacecraft. The OCFB was determined from the FAST electron and proton precipitation poleward boundary. The latitude difference between the OCFB and the onset latitude was plotted against the time difference of the FAST observation and the substorm onset. From the resulting scatter plot it can be seen that nearest to onset there is a large difference between the latitude of the OCFB and the onset. This is consistent with prior observations of substorm onsets occurring deep in a closed field line region of the magnetosphere. However there is a trend that for FAST passes occurring soon (within a few minutes) after onset the OCFB is very close to the onset latitude just as if the closed field line region poleward of the onset had disappeared. For FAST passes later than 5 minutes after the OCFB is observed more and more poleward consistent with snapshots of poleward expanding surges located at the OCFB during the substorm expansion phase., The calcium isotopic compositions (δ <SUP>44</SUP>Ca) of 30 high-purity nannofossil ooze and chalk and 7 pore fluid samples from ODP Site 807A (Ontong Java Plateau) are used in conjunction with numerical models to determine the equilibrium calcium isotope fractionation factor ( α<SUB>s-f</SUB>) between calcite and dissolved Ca <SUP>2+</SUP> and the rates of post-depositional recrystallization in deep sea carbonate ooze. The value of α<SUB>s-f</SUB> at equilibrium in the marine sedimentary section is 1.0000 ± 0.0001, which is significantly different from the value (0.9987 ± 0.0002) found in laboratory experiments of calcite precipitation and in the formation of biogenic calcite in the surface ocean. We hypothesize that this fractionation factor is relevant to calcite precipitation in any system at equilibrium and that this equilibrium fractionation factor has implications for the mechanisms responsible for Ca isotope fractionation during calcite precipitation. We describe a steady state model that offers a unified framework for explaining Ca isotope fractionation across the observed precipitation rate range of ∼14 orders of magnitude. The model attributes Ca isotope fractionation to the relative balance between the attachment and detachment fluxes at the calcite crystal surface. This model represents our hypothesis for the mechanism responsible for isotope fractionation during calcite precipitation. The Ca isotope data provide evidence that the bulk rate of calcite recrystallization in freshly-deposited carbonate ooze is 30-40%/Myr, and decreases with age to about 2%/Myr in 2-3 million year old sediment. The recrystallization rates determined from Ca isotopes for Pleistocene sediments are higher than those previously inferred from pore fluid Sr concentration and are consistent with rates derived for Late Pleistocene siliciclastic sediments using uranium isotopes. Combining our results for the equilibrium fractionation factor and recrystallization rates, we evaluate the effect of diagenesis on the Ca isotopic composition of marine carbonates at Site 807A. Since calcite precipitation rates in the sedimentary column are many orders of magnitude slower than laboratory experiments and the pore fluids are only slightly oversaturated with respect to calcite, the isotopic composition of diagenetic calcite is likely to reflect equilibrium precipitation. Accordingly, diagenesis produces a maximum shift in δ <SUP>44</SUP>Ca of +0.15‰ for Site 807A sediments but will have a larger impact where sedimentation rates are low, seawater circulates through the sediment pile, or there are prolonged depositional hiatuses., Strong X-ray emission has been observed from low-mass young stellar objects. The X-rays interact with the upper layers of the surrounding protoplanetary disk, where they are expected to dominate the thermal and chemical balance. We investigate whether there are specific diagnostics for the effects of X-rays on the properties of the gas using an updated version of the model presented earlier by Glassgold, Najita &amp; Igea (2004). We extend recent work by Glassgold, Najita &amp; Igea (2007) which predicts strong [NeII] 12.81 micron emission by X-ray irradiated disks. We find a near-linear correlation between the neon fine-structure line emission and the X-ray luminosity, which is consistent with the observations of this line by SPITZER (Pascucci et al. 2007, ApJ in press). We also make predictions of the observability of the forbidden and fine-structure lines of CI, CII, OI, SI and SII. We will discuss the spatial distribution of the emissivity of these lines as a function of position in the disk and compare the regions of the disk that they probe., We introduce a new technique to detect the discrete temperature steps that cosmic strings might have left in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy map. The technique provides a validity test on the pattern search of cosmic strings that could serve as the groundwork for future pattern searches. The detecting power of the technique is only constrained by two unavoidable features of CMB data: (1) the finite pixelization of the sky map and (2) the Gaussian fluctuation from instrumental noise and primordial anisotropy. We set the upper limit on the cosmic string parameter as Gμ&lt;~1.6×10<SUP>-5</SUP> at the 95% confidence level (CL) and find that the amplitude of the temperature step has to be greater than 44 μK in order to be detected for the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 3 year data., X-ray and optical observations of quadruply lensed quasars can provide a microarcsecond probe of the lensed quasar, corresponding to scale sizes of ~10<SUP>2</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> gravitational radii of the central black hole. This high angular resolution is achieved by taking advantage of microlensing by stars in the lensing galaxy. In this paper we use X-ray observations of 10 lensed quasars recorded with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory as well as corresponding optical data obtained with either the Hubble Space Telescope or ground-based optical telescopes. These are analyzed in a systematic and uniform way with emphasis on the flux ratio anomalies that are found relative to the predictions of smooth lens models. A comparison of the flux ratio anomalies between the X-ray and optical bands allows us to conclude that the optical emission regions of the lensed quasars are typically larger than expected from basic thin-disk models by factors of ~3-30. <P />Based on observations obtained with the Magellan Consortium's Clay Telescope., To illustrate the conceptual problems for the low-energy symmetries in the continuum of spacetime emerging from the discrete quantum geometry, Galileo symmetries are investigated in the polymer particle representation of a non-relativistic particle as a simple toy model. The complete Galileo transformations (translation, rotation and Galileo boost) are naturally defined in the polymer particle Hilbert space and Galileo symmetries are recovered with highly suppressed deviations in the low-energy regime from the underlying polymer particle description., This is a selective historical overview of the progess in understanding T Tauri spectra. Originally they were understood to be very young, but the physical conditions (or even geometry) of the material on the star and in its surroundings were mysterious. The origin and meaning of the emission lines was largely unknown. Today we have a detailed consensus of what is happening near and on these newly forming stars. They are very magnetically active, and the stellar field is strong and extensive enough to control both the final accretion onto the star and the launching of outflows which solve the angular momentum problem during formation. Much of this consensus has emerged from spectral information, but much remains to be learned. I highlight some of the seminal breakthroughs that have led to the current picture. There are very complex and time-variable components to the entire physical system that constitutes a T Tauri star, and spectral information at various wavelengths and resolutions is crucial to making further progress., Emissions of atomic oxygen are a major feature of Earth's Far-Ultraviolet signature. Recombination of ionospheric O+ is the dominant source of FUV light on the nightside away from the aurora, revealing details pertaining to ionospheric morphology and dynamics. The light originating from the bands of the equatorial ionospheric anomaly can reveal the rapid changes that occur just after sunset, such as the steep reductions of plasma density occuring with the development of ionospheric spread-F. Initial studies have used the subsequent drift of these plasma bubble signatures observed by NASA-IMAGE as a method for retrieving the zonal velocity of the ambient ionospheric plasma. The results of these studies are revisited using a newly developed technique for retrieving bubble drift velocities, that automatically identifies and tracks bubbles in the nighttime ionosphere. The technique retrieves velocities as a function of latitude, local time and longitude, allowing for multi-parameter studies of low-latitude ionospheric plasma drift. The threshold of brightness required for bubble identification and tracking using these techniques is studied in support of future NASA missions carrying an FUV imager to geostationary orbit., STEREO's IMPACT (In-situ Measurements of Particles and CME Transients) investigation provides the first opportunity for long duration, detailed observations of 1 AU magnetic field structures, plasma and suprathermal electrons, and energetic particles at points bracketing Earth's heliospheric location. The PLASTIC instrument takes plasma ion composition measurements completing STEREO's comprehensive in-situ perspective. Stereoscopic/3D information from the STEREO SECCHI imagers and SWAVES radio experiment make it possible to use both multipoint and quadrature studies to connect interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICME) and solar wind structures to CMEs and coronal holes observed at the Sun. The uniqueness of the STEREO mission requires novel data analysis tools and techniques to take advantage of the mission's full scientific potential. An interactive browser with the ability to create publication-quality plots has been developed which integrates STEREO's in-situ data with data from a variety of other missions including WIND and ACE. Static summary plots and a key-parameter type data set with a related online browser provide alternative data access. Finally, an application program interface (API) is provided allowing users to create custom software that ties directly into STEREO's data set. The API allows for more advanced forms of data mining than currently available through most web-based data services. A variety of data access techniques and the development of cross- spacecraft data analysis tools allow the larger scientific community to combine STEREO's unique in-situ data with those of other missions, particularly the L1 missions, and, therefore, to maximize STEREO's scientific potential in gaining a greater understanding of the heliosphere., Large parallel (≤100mV/m) and perpendicular (≤600mV/m) electric fields were measured in the Earth’s bow shock by the vector electric field experiment on the Polar satellite. These are the first reported direct measurements of parallel electric fields in a collisionless shock. These fields exist on spatial scales comparable to or less than the electron skin depth (a few kilometers) and correspond to magnetic-field-aligned potentials of tens of volts and perpendicular potentials up to a kilovolt. The perpendicular fields are amongst the largest ever measured in space, with energy densities of γ<SUB>0</SUB>E<SUP>2</SUP>/nk<SUB>B</SUB>T<SUB>e</SUB> of the order of 10%. The measured parallel electric field implies that the electrons are demagnetized, which may result in stochastic (rather than coherent) electron heating., Planetary systems (ours included) formed in disks of dust and gas around young stars. Disks are an integral part of the star and planet formation process, and knowledge of the distribution and temperature of inner-disk material is crucial for understanding terrestrial planet formation, giant planet migration, and accretion onto the central star. Although the inner regions of protoplanetary disks in nearby star-forming regions subtend only a few nano-radians, near-infrared interferometry has recently enabled the spatial resolution of these terrestrial zones. Most observations have probed only dust, which typically dominates the near-infrared emission. Here I report spectrally dispersed near-infrared interferometric observations that probe the gas (which dominates the mass and dynamics of the inner disk), in addition to the dust, within one astronomical unit (1AU, the Sun-Earth distance) of the young star MWC480. I resolve gas, including water vapour and atomic hydrogen, interior to the edge of the dust disk; this contrasts with results of previous spectrally dispersed interferometry observations. Interactions of this accreting gas with migrating planets may lead to short-period exoplanets like those detected around main-sequence stars. The observed water vapour is probably produced by the sublimation of migrating icy bodies, and provides a potential reservoir of water for terrestrial planets., I consider the nonaxisymmetric linear theory of a rotating, isothermal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shear flow. The analysis is performed in the shearing box, a local model of a thin disk, using a decomposition in terms of shearing waves, i.e., plane waves in a frame comoving with the shear. These waves do not have a definite frequency as in a normal mode decomposition, and numerical integration of a coupled set of amplitude equations is required to characterize their time dependence. Their generic time dependence, however, is oscillatory with slowly varying frequency and amplitude, and one can construct accurate analytical solutions by applying the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method to the full set of amplitude equations. The solutions have the following properties. (1) Their accuracy increases with wavenumber, so that most perturbations that fit within the disk are well approximated as modes with time-dependent frequencies and amplitudes. (2) They can be broadly classed as incompressive and compressive perturbations, the former including the nonaxisymmetric extension of magnetorotationally unstable modes, and the latter being the extension of fast and slow modes to a differentially rotating medium. (3) Wave action is conserved, implying that their energy varies with frequency. (4) Their shear stress is proportional to the slope of their frequency, so that they transport angular momentum outward (inward) when their frequency increases (decreases). The complete set of solutions constitutes a comprehensive linear test suite for numerical MHD algorithms that incorporate a background shear flow. I conclude with a brief discussion of possible astrophysical applications., We quantify the effects of electron thermal conduction on the properties of hot accretion flows, under the assumption of spherical symmetry. Electron heat conduction is important for low accretion rate systems where the electron cooling time is longer than the conduction time of the plasma, such as Sgr A* in the Galactic center. For accretion flows with density profiles similar to the Bondi solution [n(r)~r<SUP>-3/2</SUP>], we show that heat conduction leads to supervirial temperatures, implying that conduction significantly modifies the dynamics of the accretion flow. We then self-consistently solve for the dynamics of spherical accretion in the presence of saturated conduction and electron heating. We find that the accretion rate onto the central object can be reduced by ~1-3 orders of magnitude relative to the canonical Bondi rate. Electron conduction may thus be an important ingredient in explaining the low radiative efficiencies and low accretion rates inferred from observations of low-luminosity galactic nuclei. The solutions presented in this paper may also describe the nonlinear saturation of the magnetothermal instability in hot accretion flows., In this the first of a series of Letters, we present a panchromatic data set in the Extended Groth Strip region of the sky. Our survey, the All-Wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey (AEGIS), aims to study the physical properties and evolutionary processes of galaxies at z~1. It includes the following deep, wide-field imaging data sets: Chandra/ACIS X-ray, GALEX ultraviolet, CFHT/MegaCam Legacy Survey optical, CFHT/CFH12K optical, Hubble Space Telescope/ACS optical and NICMOS near-infrared, Palomar/WIRC near-infrared, Spitzer/IRAC mid-infrared, Spitzer/MIPS far-infrared, and VLA radio continuum. In addition, this region of the sky has been targeted for extensive spectroscopy using the Deep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) on the Keck II 10 m telescope. Our survey is compared to other large multiwavelength surveys in terms of depth and sky coverage., We present evidence of a dual active galactic nucleus (AGN) within an early-type galaxy at z=0.709 in the extended Groth strip. The galaxy lies on the red sequence, with absolute magnitude M<SUB>B</SUB>=-21.0 (AB, with h=0.7) and rest-frame color U-B=1.38. Its optical spectrum shows strong, double-peaked [O III] emission lines and weak Hβ emission, with Seyfert-like line ratios. The two narrow peaks are separated by 630 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> in velocity and arise from two distinct regions, spatially resolved in the DEIMOS spectrum, with a projected physical separation of 1.2 kpc. HST ACS imaging shows an early-type (E/S0) galaxy with hints of disturbed structure, consistent with the remnant of a dissipationless merger. Multiwavelength photometric information from the AEGIS consortium confirms the identification of a dust-obscured AGN in an early-type galaxy, with detections in X-ray, optical, infrared, and radio wave bands. These data are most readily explained as a single galaxy harboring two AGNs-the first such system to be observed in an otherwise typical early-type galaxy., Large parallel electric fields (E<SUB>∥</SUB> &gt; 10 mV/m) are sometimes observed with intense filamentary field-aligned currents (J<SUB>∥</SUB> &gt; 10 μA/m<SUP>2</SUP> mapped to 100-km altitude) on transverse scales where k<SUB>x</SUB>c/ω<SUB>pe</SUB> ≈ 1 above the auroral oval. The ratio of the transverse electric (E<SUB>x</SUB>) and magnetic field (B<SUB>y</SUB>) variations is approximately the local Alfvén speed and increases with decreasing transverse scale in a manner consistent with inertial Alfvén wave dispersion. These fields are typically observed in association with density cavities. Statistically, it is shown that the depth of the cavities observed over the altitude range from 350 to 4175 km by the Fast Auroral Snapshot (FAST) satellite typically lies between 30 and 50% of the background plasma with 90% depletions being observed for 1% of the recorded events. The wave currents embedded within these cavities exceed 100 μA/m<SUP>2</SUP> for 2% of the ensemble and are typically found over transverse widths of ∼2πλ<SUB>e</SUB>. Using a fluid description of the plasma, we show statistically that electron pressure gradients provide a probable means for balancing the large E<SUB>∥</SUB> found in these structures with a likely but unknown contribution from anomalous resistivity. Furthermore, we find that the ratio of the average drift speed of the bulk electron plasma (v<SUB>d</SUB>) to the electron thermal speed (v<SUB>e</SUB>) inside these structures is v<SUB>d</SUB>/v<SUB>e</SUB> ≥ 0.1 and that in at least 2% of cases veh05<SUB>d</SUB>/v<SUB>e</SUB> ≥ 1.0. On the basis of recent simulation results and the Bohm criterion for double layer formation, these statistics indicate that the large E<SUB>∥</SUB> sometimes observed in density cavities may occur in double layers driven by the Alfvén wave current., X-ray cluster measurements interpreted with a universal baryon/gas mass fraction can theoretically serve as a cosmological distance probe. We examine issues of cosmological sensitivity for current (e.g. Chandra X-ray Observatory, XMM-Newton) and next-generation (e.g. Con-X, XEUS) observations, along with systematic uncertainties and biases. To give competitive next-generation constraints on dark energy, we find that systematics will need to be controlled to better than 1% and any evolution in f<SUB>gas</SUB> (and other cluster gas properties) must be calibrated so the residual uncertainty is weaker than (1+z)<SUP>0.03</SUP>., Interferometric observations of α Herculis at a wavelength of 11.15 μm over the period 1989-2004 show large visibility variations. These variations are interpreted as an ejection of approximately 10<SUP>-6</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> of material in 1990 that has subsequently expanded and dissipated. The expansion rate is approximately 75 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, much larger than previous observations. No substantial material has been emitted during the subsequent 14 years., We solve the one-dimensional neutrino-heated nonrelativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind problem for conditions that range from slowly rotating (spin period P&gt;~10 ms) proto-neutron stars (PNSs) with field strengths typical of radio pulsars (B&lt;~10<SUP>13</SUP> G) to ``protomagnetars'' with B~10<SUP>14</SUP>-10<SUP>15</SUP> G in their hypothesized rapidly rotating initial states (P~1 ms). We use the relativistic axisymmetric simulations of Bucciantini and coworkers to map our split-monopole results onto a more physical dipole geometry and to estimate the spin-down of PNSs when their winds are relativistic. We then quantify the effects of rotation and magnetic fields on the mass loss, energy loss, and r-process nucleosynthesis in PNS winds. We describe the evolution of PNS winds through the Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling epoch, emphasizing the transition between (1) thermal neutrino-driven, (2) nonrelativistic magnetically dominated, and (3) relativistic magnetically dominated outflows. In the latter, spin-down is enhanced relative to the canonical force-free rate because of additional open magnetic flux caused by neutrino-driven mass loss. We find that protomagnetars with P~1 ms and B&gt;~10<SUP>15</SUP> G drive winds with luminosities, energies, and Lorentz factors (magnetization σ~0.1-1000) consistent with those required to produce long-duration gamma-ray bursts and hyperenergetic supernovae (SNe). A significant fraction of the rotational energy may be extracted in only a few seconds, sufficiently rapidly to alter the energy of the SN remnant, its morphology, and potentially its nucleosynthesis. We show that winds from protomagnetars with P~2-10 ms produce conditions more favorable for the r-process than winds from slowly rotating, nonmagnetized PNSs; in addition, energy and momentum deposition by convectively excited waves further increase the likelihood of a successful r-process., Spectra of the XA shock-cloud interaction region in the Cygnus Loop obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) are presented and analyzed. Several weak emission lines never before detected in the spectra of remnants are identified in a combined spectrum from four bright regions. The intensities of the silicon lines measured in this spectrum show that the 120-200 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> shocks are present in the XA region and are effective at liberating silicon from grains. Differences among the spectra imply that the shocked gas has a complex ionization structure. The strongest lines in the spectra, and also the most uniformly distributed, are O VI λλ1032, 1038. Approximately 10% of the O VI emission from regions interior to the main shock interaction arises from coronal (million-degree) gas. Model calculations show that the shock at the boundary between the cloud and remnant has a velocity of about 180 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and has swept up a hydrogen column N<SUB>H</SUB> = 1.66 × 10<SUP>18</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, indicating that the blast wave encountered the cloud about 5000 years ago. The O VI line profiles imply that the boundary shock is dominated by a single broad component with an intrinsic velocity width parameter, b approx 48 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is probably the result of bulk motions due to curvature of the shock front. Differences between the O VI velocity profiles of two regions separated by 20″ on the sky suggest the presence of a concentrated region of dust, which absorbs emission from the shock on the far side of the cloud. <P />Based on observations made with the NASA-CNES-CSA Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer. FUSE is operated for NASA by The Johns Hopkins University under NASA contract NAS5-32985., It is difficult for liquid water to erupt onto the surface of icy satellites, such as Europa and Enceladus, because liquid water is more dense than ice. If the ice shell thickens, the volume expansion of ice upon freezing increases pressure in the subsurface ocean. The excess pressure is determined by a balance between compression of ocean water and elastic expansion of the ice shell. We show that on Europa the freezing of ~ 1-10 km of ice generates tangential stresses that exceed the tensile strength of ice. Excess pressure, however, is insufficient for liquid water to erupt to the surface. Within smaller icy satellites, such as Enceladus, ocean pressure can become large enough to cause an eruption of large amounts of liquid water., Two different innermost inner core (IMIC) models have recently been proposed, each with different radii and different orientation and strength of anisotropy. In order to test these IMIC models, we have systematically assembled a high quality dataset of broadband PKIKP data in the epicentral distance range of 150° to 180°. Our new dataset consists of ~1,100 individually measured absolute PKIKP arrival times. Also, PKIKP bottoming points and ray paths in the inner core are well distributed in the east-west and north-south hemispheres. We invert this dataset for two layer models of anisotropy in the inner core and compare the fits obtained with those predicted from the existing IMIC models. Our results show that, if there is an IMIC, its radius is most likely around ~500 km rather than the ~300 km originally proposed, and is in better agreement with the layering in the inner core based on PKIKP waveform modeling., Using a sample of 19464 galaxies drawn from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey, we study the relationship between galaxy colour and environment at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.35. We find that the fraction of galaxies on the red sequence depends strongly on local environment out to z &gt; 1, being larger in regions of greater galaxy density. At all epochs probed, we also find a small population of red, morphologically early-type galaxies residing in regions of low measured overdensity. The observed correlations between the red fraction and local overdensity are highly significant, with the trend at z &gt; 1 detected at a greater than 5σ level. Over the entire redshift regime studied, we find that the colour-density relation evolves continuously, with red galaxies more strongly favouring overdense regions at low z relative to their red-sequence counterparts at high redshift. At z &gt;~ 1.3, the red fraction only weakly correlates with overdensity, implying that any colour dependence to the clustering of ~L* galaxies at that epoch must be small. Our findings add weight to existing evidence that the build-up of galaxies on the red sequence has occurred preferentially in overdense environments (i.e. galaxy groups) at z &lt;~ 1.5. Furthermore, we identify the epoch (z ~ 2) at which typical ~L* galaxies began quenching and moved on to the red sequence in significant number. The strength of the observed evolutionary trends at 0 &lt; z &lt; 1.35 suggests that the correlations observed locally, such as the morphology-density and colour-density relations, are the result of environment-driven mechanisms (i.e. `nurture') and do not appear to have been imprinted (by `nature') upon the galaxy population during their epoch of formation., We present new FIR maps of the SMC at 24, 70, and 160 μm obtained as part of the Spitzer Survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud (S<SUP>3</SUP>MC). These maps cover most of the star formation in the SMC bar and wing. We combine our maps with literature data to derive the dust mass surface density across the SMC. We find a total dust mass of M<SUB>dust</SUB>=3×10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>, implying a dust-to-hydrogen ratio over the region studied of log10(D/H)=-2.86, or 1:700, which includes H<SUB>2</SUB>. Assuming the dust to trace the total gas column, we derive H<SUB>2</SUB> surface densities across the SMC. We find a total H<SUB>2</SUB> mass M<SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB></SUB>=3.2×10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> in a distribution similar to that of the CO, but more extended. We compare profiles of CO and H<SUB>2</SUB> around six molecular peaks; on average H<SUB>2</SUB> is more extended than CO by a factor of ~1.3. The implied CO-to-H<SUB>2</SUB> conversion factor over the whole SMC is X<SUB>CO</SUB>=(13+/-1)×10<SUP>21</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> (K km s<SUP>-1</SUP>)<SUP>-1</SUP>. Over the volume occupied by CO the conversion factor is lower, X<SUB>CO</SUB>=(6+/-1)×10<SUP>21</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> (K km s<SUP>-1</SUP>)<SUP>-1</SUP>, but still a few times larger than that found using virial mass methods. The molecular peaks have H<SUB>2</SUB> surface densities Σ<SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB></SUB>~180+/-30 M<SUB>solar</SUB> pc<SUP>-2</SUP>, similar to those in Milky Way GMCs, and correspondingly low extinctions, A<SUB>V</SUB>~1-2 mag. The theory of photoionization-regulated star formation predicts A<SUB>V</SUB>~6, which would require the GMCs to be ~3 times smaller than our 46 pc resolution element. For a given hydrostatic gas pressure, the SMC has a 2-3 times lower ratio of molecular to atomic gas than spiral galaxies. Combined with lower mean densities, this results in this galaxy having only 10% of its gas in the molecular phase., Space weather storms at the Earth are dominated by the magnetosphere's response to coronal mass ejections, or CMEs, whose disturbances propagate through the solar wind to 1 AU, and to a lesser extent by the pressure ridges associated with the interactions of solar wind streams with different properties. The interplanetary signatures of these events include high solar wind dynamic pressures and high interplanetary magnetic fields, the same parameters that cause compression and/or magnetization of the ionosphere at weakly magnetized Venus. The nature of Venus' response to these events is also expected to include increased atmosphere erosion by the solar wind interaction, a matter of potential interest for historical extrapolations of atmosphere escape. We consider the possible evidence for enhanced escape during these disturbances in the data from the Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO). Available magnetometer and plasma analyzer results are used to identify periods of interest and the interplanetary characteristics of the disturbed periods. It is found that the suprathermal (&gt;36 eV) ion measurements from the Pioneer Venus neutral mass spectrometer (ONMS) provide convincing evidence of the related enhanced escape of mostly O<SUP>+</SUP> suprathermal ions. The results provide the first direct demonstration that space weather has played an important role in Venus (and other weakly magnetized planet) atmosphere loss through time. It is important to pursue study of these effects with the new measurements from Venus Express and, in light of the approaching solar activity cycle rising phase, extremely timely., We consider the model of 'chain inflation,' in which the period of inflation in our universe took the form of a long sequence of quantum tunnelling events. We find that in the simplest such scenario, in which the tunnelling processes are uniform, approximately 10<SUP>4</SUP> vacua per e-folding of inflation are required in order for the density perturbations produced to be of an acceptable size. We arrive at this conclusion through a combination of analytic and numerical techniques, which could also serve as starting points for calculations with more general sets of assumptions., Using data sets from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey, we have conducted a multiwavelength study of interstellar components, covering the region 102.5<SUP>deg</SUP>&lt;l&lt;141.5<SUP>deg</SUP> and -3.03<SUP>deg</SUP>&lt;b&lt;5.41<SUP>deg</SUP>. By comparing column density tracers of dust, atomic hydrogen, and molecular gas (traced by CO emission), we have found regions where the dust optical depth shows evidence of more gas than is predicted by the H I and CO observations. Within this population of infrared excess sources, it is possible to discriminate between sources associated with low and high dust temperatures. We interpret the colder temperature sources as molecular clouds/clumps not traced by the CO J=1-0 transition. Possible reasons include the depletion of CO onto dust grains in the coldest, densest regions of molecular clouds, or photodissociation of CO on the outskirts of molecular clouds., We explore the behaviour of the blue galaxy fraction over the redshift range 0.75 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.3 in the DEEP2 Survey, both for field galaxies and for galaxies in groups. The primary aim is to determine the role that groups play in driving the evolution of galaxy colour at high z. In pursuing this aim, it is essential to define a galaxy sample that does not suffer from redshift-dependent selection effects in colour-magnitude space. We develop four such samples for this study: at all redshifts considered, each one is complete in colour-magnitude space, and the selection also accounts for evolution in the galaxy luminosity function. These samples will also be useful for future evolutionary studies in DEEP2. The colour segregation observed between local group and field samples is already in place at z ~ 1: DEEP2 groups have a significantly lower blue fraction than the field. At fixed z, there is also a correlation between blue fraction and galaxy magnitude, such that brighter galaxies are more likely to be red, both in groups and in the field. In addition, there is a negative correlation between blue fraction and group richness. In terms of evolution, the blue fraction in groups and the field remains roughly constant from z = 0.75 to 1, but beyond this redshift the blue fraction in groups rises rapidly with z, and the group and field blue fractions become indistinguishable at z ~ 1.3. Careful tests indicate that this effect does not arise from known systematic or selection effects. To further ensure the robustness of this result, we build on previous mock DEEP2 catalogues to develop mock catalogues that reproduce the colour-overdensity relation observed in DEEP2 and use these to test our methods. The convergence between the group and field blue fractions at z ~ 1.3 implies that DEEP2 galaxy groups only became efficient at quenching star formation at z ~ 2; this result is broadly consistent with other recent observations and with current models of galaxy evolution and hierarchical structure growth., We present the first results using the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) to observe solar X-ray emission not associated with active regions, sunspots, or flares (the quiet Sun). Using a newly developed chopping technique (fan-beam modulation) during seven periods of offpointing between 2005 June and 2006 October, we obtained upper limits over 3-200 keV for the quietest times when the GOES 12 1-8 Å flux fell below 10<SUP>-8</SUP> W m<SUP>-2</SUP>. These values are smaller than previous limits in the 17-120 keV range and extend them to both lower and higher energies. The limit in 3-6 keV is consistent with a coronal temperature &lt;=6 MK. For quiet-Sun periods when the GOES 12 1-8 Å background flux was between 10<SUP>-8</SUP> and 10<SUP>-7</SUP> W m<SUP>-2</SUP>, the RHESSI 3-6 keV flux correlates to this as a power law, with an index of 1.08+/-0.13. The power-law correlation for microflares has a steeper index of 1.29+/-0.06. We also discuss the possibility of observing quiet-Sun X-rays due to solar axions and use the RHESSI quiet-Sun limits to estimate the axion-to-photon coupling constant for two different axion emission scenarios., The means by which charged particles are accelerated in space to form the aurora is still not fully understood. This acceleration produces earthward streaming electrons driving auroral luminosity and outward streaming ionospheric ions which populate space with terrestrial matter. With the advent of high resolution space borne field and particle instruments, dispersive Alfvén waves (DAWs) have been identified as drivers of auroral particle acceleration and it has been shown that the Alfvén wave energy observed is sufficient to power a significant fraction of auroral luminosity. Since previously it has been considered that auroral particle acceleration occurs in quasi-steady field-aligned currents, quantifying the amount of particle acceleration occurring in DAWs relative to the traditionally invoked processes is fundamental to our understanding of how the aurora works. We combine coincident satellite measurements of fields and particles to demonstrate that as functions of increasing auroral activity 25-39% of the total electron energy deposited in the ionosphere and 15-34% of total energetic ion outflow may be attributed to the action of DAWs. In fact in the vicinity of the polar cusps and pre-midnight auroral oval, DAWs may provide the dominant means for powering electron and ion acceleration during active times., We present an updated version of the multicolor light-curve shape method to measure distances to Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), incorporating new procedures for K-correction and extinction corrections. We also develop a simple model to disentangle intrinsic color variations and reddening by dust and expand the method to incorporate U-band light curves and to more easily accommodate prior constraints on any of the model parameters. We apply this method to 133 nearby SNe Ia, including 95 objects in the Hubble flow (cz&gt;=2500 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), which give an intrinsic dispersion of less than 7% in distance. The Hubble flow sample, which is of critical importance to all cosmological uses of SNe Ia, is the largest ever presented with homogeneous distances. We find that the Hubble flow SNe with H<SUB>0</SUB>d<SUB>SN</SUB>&gt;=7400 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> yield an expansion rate that is 6.5%+/-1.8% lower than the rate determined from SNe within that distance, and this can have a large effect on measurements of the dark energy equation of state with SNe Ia. Peculiar velocities of SN Ia host galaxies in the rest frame of the Local Group are consistent with the dipole measured in the cosmic microwave background. Direct fits of SNe Ia that are significantly reddened by dust in their host galaxies suggest that their mean extinction law may be described by R<SUB>V</SUB>~=2.7, but optical colors alone provide weak constraints on R<SUB>V</SUB>., We use spectrally dispersed near-IR interferometry data to constrain the temperature profiles of sub-AU-sized regions of 11 Herbig Ae/Be sources. We find that a single-temperature ring does not reproduce the data well. Rather, models incorporating radial temperature gradients are preferred. These gradients may arise in a dusty disk, or may reflect separate gas and dust components with different temperatures and spatial distributions. Comparison of our models with broadband spectral energy distributions suggests the latter explanation. The data support the view that the near-IR emission of Herbig Ae/Be sources arises from hot circumstellar dust and gas in sub-AU-sized disk regions. Intriguingly, our derived temperature gradients appear systematically steeper for disks around higher mass stars. It is not clear, however, whether this reflects trends in relative dust/gas contributions or gradients within individual components., Spitzer Space Telescope images of the luminous blue variable (LBV) candidate HD 168625 reveal the existence of a bipolar nebula several times larger than its previously known equatorial dust torus. The outer nebula of HD 168625 has a full extent of ~80"" or 0.85 pc, and one of the lobes has a well-defined polar ring. The nebula is a near twin of the triple-ring system around SN 1987A. Because of these polar rings, and accounting for stellar/progenitor luminosity, HD 168625 is an even closer twin of SN 1987A than the B supergiant Sher 25 in NGC 3603. HD 168625's nebula was probably ejected during a giant LBV eruption and not during a red supergiant phase, so its similarity to the nebula around SN 1987A may open new possibilities for the creation of SN 1987A's rings. Namely, the hypothesis that Sk -69 202 suffered an LBV-like eruption would avert the complete surrender of single-star models for its bipolar nebula by offering an alternative to an unlikely binary merger scenario. It also hints that LBVs are the likely progenitors of some Type II supernovae, and that HD 168625's nebula is a good example of a pre-explosion environment. <P />Based on observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under NASA contract 1407., The Tswaing meteorite impact crater is a 1.13 km diameter structure located in the 2.05 Ga Nebo granite of the Bushveld Complex. The impact age had previously been determined by fission track dating to 220 ± 104 ka. <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar step-heating and total fusion experiments performed on single- and multi-grain impact glass aliquots gave apparent ages ranging from 1.0 ± 0.3 Ma to 204 ± 6 Ma. These ""ages"" indicate that the radiogenic Ar derived from the target rocks has not been completely degassed as a result of the impact process, despite fusion of the target material. Results of step-heating experiments imply that the 40Arinherited∗ trapped within the glass is located in two distinct reservoirs thought to be the glass matrix and fluid/vapor inclusions (or un-melted residual clasts). Calculations assuming an age of 0.2 ± 0.1 Ma for Tswaing (fission track data) reveal that the amount of inherited <SUP>40</SUP>Ar*( 40Arinherited∗) relative to the pre-impact concentration varies from 0.015% to 4.15%. The spread defined by 40Arinherited∗ likely reflects the various quench rates experienced by the glass, most certainly due to the pre-impact position of the sample relative to the center of the crater. We compare the influence of 40Arinherited∗ on the apparent <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar age determination of five impact structures. Our calculations show that the main characteristic controlling the age offset (for a given proportion of 40Arinherited∗) is the age difference between the impact and the target rocks (i.e., the <SUP>40</SUP>Ar* concentration in the target rock). The buffer effect for a given crater structure can be predicted knowing the age of the basement and having a rough estimation of the age of the crater structure itself. The occurrence of 40Arinherited∗ is likely influenced by (1) the degree of polymerization (i.e., silicate structure complexity) of the target rock and presumably related to the diffusivity of Ar in the melt and glass, (2) the Ar partial pressure at the grain boundary, (3) the quantity of energy involved in the impact, and (4) the porosity of the target rocks. For glass that inevitably suffers inherited and/or excess <SUP>40</SUP>Ar*, the use of the inverse isochron technique can be appropriate but should be applied with careful statistical treatment., Due to an error at the Press, gradient terms are missing from equations (3) and (4) and the text above equation (21) and following equation (23). <P />1.

Detecting the predicted cosmogenic (Greisen-Zatsepin- Kusmin, ""GZK"") neutrinos at 10<SUP>16</SUP> - 10<SUP>20</SUP> eV would test models of cosmic ray production at these energies and probe particle physics at ~100 TeV center-of-mass energy. IceCube may be able to detect ~10 GZK events per year with an extension including optical, radio, and acoustic receivers sparsely arrayed surrounding the optical core. Such a detector would feature crosscalibration with coincident events and would allow superior background rejection capability, energy and direction resolution, and confidence in discovered signals compared to single-method detectors. We present estimates of the neutrino effective volume for such a hybrid array both with the single-method sub-arrays independently and requiring combinations of sub-arrays to detect the same events. We also present ideas on hybrid event reconstruction and results from a proof-of-principle Monte Carlo test of a hybrid reconstruction algorithm., The unusual source IRC +10216 is the brightest stellar object at mid-infrared wavelengths in the northern hemisphere. Adding to its distinctiveness, the dust around IRC +10216 almost completely enshrouds the star and has an extremely complex distribution. We report the imaging of IRC +10216 at 11.15 μm with three telescopes and the closure phase at two different stellar phases. Three-baseline interferometry data from a linear array of telescopes is used to create a one-dimensional image of the star and circumstellar dust. The two epochs over which data have been taken provide information at different position angles, which yields some insight into the two-dimensional structure of IRC +10216. Specifically, we observe two areas of peaked intensity. The first is 66+/-4 mas to the west and 160+/-51 mas to the south of the star, and the second is 227+/-8 mas to the east and 94+/-57 mas to the south. These two features can explain most of the observed asymmetry., We detected significant Zeeman splitting in the 1667 MHz OH megamaser emission from four ultraluminous galaxies. These detections, in addition to being the first extragalactic detection of the Zeeman effect in an emission line, suggest that OH megamasers are excellent extragalactic magnetometers., A trajectory-based solution of Maxwell's equations is derived using the method of multiple scales. This time-domain technique utilizes an asymptotic expansion in terms of the ratio of the wave front length-scale to the length-scale of the heterogeneity. The approach provides an alternative to an expansion in terms of frequency and allows one to model electromagnetic wave propagation over a wide frequency band. At the lower end of the frequency band, the trajectory-based solution reduces to a previously derived diffusive solution. Similarly, at higher frequencies one obtains the `delta-like' solution associated with hyperbolic wave propagation. However, the solution is also valid at intermediate frequencies which cannot be characterized as either diffusive or hyperbolic. A numerical illustration demonstrates the importance of both conduction and displacement currents at frequencies between 10 and 100 MHz. The amplitudes computed using the trajectory-based approach compare well with analytic results for a homogeneous whole-space. Using the technique I am able to model observations from a broad-band (3-300 kHz) experiment at the Richmond Field Station in California. In addition, ground penetrating radar waveforms in the 5-200 MHz range, gathered at the Boise Hydrogeophysical Research Site, are matched using the results of a radar velocity tomogram., We present a refined catalog for the positions of 179 gamma-ray burst (GRB) X-ray afterglows observed by the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) on Swift prior to 2006 November 1. The positions are determined by detecting X-ray field sources in the deep X-ray images and comparing the centroids to those of optical sources in the Digitized Sky Survey red2 catalog or the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 5 catalog. Half of the 90% confidence error region radii are &lt;2.2"". The error regions areas are typically ~4 times smaller than the best XRT team error regions, although the positions require deep X-ray integration (&gt;20 ks) and cannot be generated nearly as rapidly after the GRB. The positions derived for &gt;90% of 77 bursts with optical afterglows are consistent with the optical transient positions, without the need for systematic error. About 20% of the afterglow positions require a sizable shift in the Swift satellite aspect. We discuss the optical/X-ray properties of the field sources and discuss the implications of the frame offsets for studies of optically dark GRBs., Neutrino astronomy was initiated primarily to search for TeV to PeV neutrinos from Active Galactic Nuclei, and the optical Cherenkov technique is well suited for this energy range. Interest has grown recently in detecting EeV neutrinos, particularly the ""cosmogenic"" neutrinos produced during propagation of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) through the microwave background radiation. These neutrinos could be a powerful tool both to resolve the mystery of the UHECR sources and to test fundamental physics at the ~100 TeV scale. The optical technique is not cost effective at these energies and newer techniques such as radio and acoustic detection are necessary. Accelerator experiments have con.rmed the production of both types of signals from high-energy showers in various media, and quantitative measurements have con.rmed theoretical descriptions of the signal strength, frequency content and pulse shape. While radio experiments have set the strongest limits so far, the acoustic method could contribute with an entirely independent signal production and detection mechanism and may be more effective at the highest energies. E.orts are underway to develop the acoustic method in various media around the world, with arrays operating in ocean water at the Bahamas, the UK, and the Mediterranean Sea; detectors prepared for deployment in the South Pole ice in the next year; and ideas for future acoustic detectors in salt domes and on Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf. Regardless of which method is individually most sensitive, the best con.guration may be to co-deploy arrays to combine the techniques and seek coincident detection of individual neutrino events., Francesco Melchiorri began his scientific career as a condensed matter physicist. In the early 1970s he developed an interest in far infrared astrophysics and especially in measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. First at Florence and later at Rome, his group made measurements of the spectrum of the CMB, the dipole and smaller scale anisotropies, and of the Sunyaev Zeldovich effect. At every stage of this process there were remarkable parallels between Francesco's career at Florence and Rome and the Author's career at Berkeley. This paper in honor of Francesco Melchiorri will describe some of these parallels, focusing on measurements of the CMB., Well separated individual PKP precursors observed at the Yellowknife seismic array (YK) for a high quality doublet of earthquakes provide an opportunity to study the location of the corresponding scatterers and assess the stability of the location estimation. Based on the comparison of the waveforms of stacked individual precursors and those of PKIKP phases, we are able to determine that most of these precursors originate from scattering of the PKPbc (rather than the PKPab) branch above the B caustic on the receiver side. This allows a reliable location of the scatterers in the lower mantle. Their depths range from 2890 km (the CMB) to 2270 km, scattering angles range from 45.8° to 16.0°, and surface projections range from southern Ontario to northern Saskatchewan in Canada. These locations are associated with transitions from slow to fast velocities in mantle tomographic models and follow the expected general dip direction of fossil slabs under north America. This suggests that the subducted slab remnants under north America have retained their compositional signature. The fact that we can essentially treat these scatterers as reflections from plane boundaries suggests that the remnant fragments of slab may be spatially extended, which should be confirmed using broadband data. Average differences in measured slowness and back-azimuth of the doublet precursors are as small as 0.08 s/deg and 1.4 deg, respectively. Our study indicates that it may be possible to locate such scatterers using single earthquakes and small aperture seismic arrays., We present four new exoplanets: HIP 14810b and HIP 14810c, HD 154345b, and HD 187123c. The two planets orbiting HIP 14810, from the N2K project, have masses of 3.9 and 0.76 M<SUB>J</SUB>. We have searched the radial velocity time series of 90 known exoplanet systems and found new residual trends due to additional, long period companions. Two stars known to host one exoplanet have sufficient curvature in the residuals to a one planet fit to constrain the minimum mass of the outer companion to be substellar: HD 68988c with 8 M<SUB>J</SUB>&lt;msini&lt;20 M<SUB>J</SUB> and HD 187123c with 3 M<SUB>J</SUB>&lt;msini&lt;7 M<SUB>J</SUB>, both with P&gt;8 yr. We have also searched the velocity residuals of known exoplanet systems for prospective low-amplitude exoplanets and present some candidates. We discuss techniques for constraining the mass and period of exoplanets in such cases, and for quantifying the significance of weak RV signals. We also present two substellar companions with incomplete orbits and periods longer than 8 yr: HD 24040b and HD 154345b with msini&lt;20 M<SUB>J</SUB> and msini&lt;10 M<SUB>J</SUB>, respectively. <P />Based on observations obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation. The authors wish to recognize and acknowledge the very significant cultural role and reverence that the summit of Mauna Kea has always had within the indigenous Hawaiian community. We are most fortunate to have the opportunity to conduct observations from this mountain., The cosmological constant and many other possible origins for acceleration of the cosmic expansion possess variations in the dark energy properties slow on the Hubble time scale. Given that models with more rapid variation, or even phase transitions, are possible though, we examine the fineness in redshift with which cosmological probes can realistically be employed, and what constraints this could impose on dark energy behavior. In particular, we discuss various aspects of baryon acoustic oscillations, and their use to measure the Hubble parameter H(z). We find that currently considered cosmological probes have an innate resolution no finer than Δz≈0.2 0.3., Observations of interstellar regions in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) obtained serendipitously by the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) have revealed O VI λ1032 emission from several superbubbles and from one region not associated with any nebula. In every case, the O VI emission is centered at or around the LMC velocity of +275 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The O VI surface brightnesses (8900-21,800 LU [line unit; 1 photon s<SUP>-1</SUP> cm<SUP> -2</SUP> sr<SUP>-1</SUP>]) toward superbubbles are significantly higher than the value (6400 LU) in the one LMC diffuse-gas spectrum, and also higher than in spectra of the diffuse hot gas emission in our Galaxy (Dixon et al.). The superbubble O VI brightnesses are lower than those of supernova remnants, but their values are consistent with the emission arising in supernova-driven shocks. However, other emission mechanisms, such as conductive interfaces and turbulent mixing layers, are not excluded by our data. <P />Based on observations made with the NASA-CNES-CSA Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer. FUSE is operated for NASA by the Johns Hopkins University under NASA contract NAS 5-32985., We present optical photometry and spectra of the peculiar Type Ib supernova (SN) 2006jc. Strong and relatively narrow He I emission lines indicate the progenitor star exploded inside a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) rich in He. An exceptionally blue apparent continuum persists from our first spectrum obtained 15 days after discovery through our last spectrum ~1 month later. Based on the presence of isolated Fe II emission lines, we interpret the blue ``continuum'' as blended, perhaps fluorescent, Fe emission. One or two of the reddest He I line profiles in our spectra are double-peaked, suggesting that the CSM has an aspherical geometry. The He I lines that are superposed on the blue continuum show P Cygni profiles, while the redder He I lines do not, implying that the blue continuum also originates from an asymmetric mass distribution. The He-rich CSM, aspherical geometry, and line velocities indicate that the progenitor star was a WNE Wolf-Rayet (W-R) star. A recent (2 years before the SN), coincident, luminous outburst similar to those seen in luminous blue variables (LBVs) is the leading candidate for the dense CSM. Such an eruption associated with a W-R star has not been seen before, indicating that the progenitor star may have recently transitioned from the LBV phase. We also present unpublished spectral and photometric data on SN 2002ao, which, along with SN 1999cq, is very similar to SN 2006jc. We propose that these three objects may represent a new and distinct class of SNe arising from W-R progenitors surrounded by a dense CSM., Debris disks consist of circumstellar dust grains that are freshly produced through the attrition of planetesimals around the star. Study of these disks improves our understanding of the evolution of circumstellar material over the stars' main sequence lifetimes. They provide a record of the processes governing planet formation. Moreover, the disks' architectures can reveal the presence of planets through their gravitational signatures. The edge-on disk around the A0V star HD 32297 was recently imaged in scattered light in the near IR (Schneider et al. 2005) and visible (Kalas 2005). In September 2006, we resolved thermal emission from the dust disk with Gemini/Michelle. These observations suggest an inner edge to the parent body distribution at 65 AU. Further, these observations hint at slight asymmetries in the brightness distribution. Asymmetric brightness and displacement of dust lobes can be due to unseen planetary perturbers (Wyatt et al. 1999), as suggested for Fomalhaut's dust ring (Holland et al. 2003; Kalas et al. 2005; Quillen 2006). We propose to use Gemini/Michelle to obtain deeper images of HD 32297's thermal emission at high spatial resolution (N' band), in order to quantify the level of asymmetry in the disk and fully determine its spatial extent. We will further constrain the temperature structure of the disk by imaging at longer wavelengths (Qa band). Finally, we will use low-resolution spectra in the 10 micron region to measure the composition of the disk material. These observations will inform our understanding of the evolution of disk material throughout the planet building phase., We present the first direct magnetic field measurements on M dwarfs cooler than spectral class M4.5. Utilizing a new method based on the FeH band near 1 μm, we categorize the integrated surface magnetic flux as low (well under 1 kG), intermediate (between 1 and about 2.5 kG), or strong (greater than about 3 kG) for a set of more than 20 stars ranging from M2 down to M9. Along with the field, we also measure the rotational broadening (vsini) and Hα emission strength. Our goal is to advance the understanding of how dynamo field production varies with stellar parameters for very low mass stars, how the field and emission activity are related, and whether there is a connection between the rotation and magnetic flux. We find that fields are produced throughout the M dwarfs. In the mid-M stars, there is a clear connection between slow rotation and weak fields. In the late-M stars, rotation is always measurable, and the strongest fields are associated with with the most rapid rotators. Interestingly, these very cool rapid rotators appear to have the largest magnetic flux in the whole sample (greater than in the classical dMe stars). Hα emission is found to be a good proxy for magnetic fields, although the relation between the fractional emission and the magnetic flux varies with effective temperature. The drop-off in this fractional emission near the bottom of the main sequence is not accompanied by a drop-off in magnetic flux. It is clear that the methodology we have developed can be further applied to discover more about the behavior of magnetic dynamos and activity in cool and fully convective objects., The New Horizons spacecraft will fly past Jupiter on February 28th 2007, obtaining close-up observations of Io's volcanoes, surface, and the Jovian magnetosphere which is filled with Io-derived plasma. We propose to provide a context for the New Horizons (NH) observations of Io by 1-4 micron AO imaging of Io's volcanoes during, and after the encounter (+ 2 week). Specifically, we will broaden the time base of New Horizons coverage to help determine which volcanoes seen by New Horizons are long-lived or short lived. We will look for and characterize any large eruptions that might inject plasma into the magnetosphere during NH observations of the Io torus and magnetosphere, and will extend the New Horizons infrared wavelength coverage from 2.5 to 4.0 microns for better constraints on the nature of the eruptions., The responses of the HadSM3 and NCAR CCM3 general circulation models to a change in solar insolation are compared to their responses to a doubling of CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration. In both models, it is found that the important difference is a rapid adjustment of the troposphere in the solar case that reduces the value of effective radiative forcing by about 25%. Clear-sky warming appears to make the major contribution. Subsequent warming of the coupled troposphere, land-surface, ocean mixed-layer system occurs with a very similar sensitivity to that expected under a CO<SUB>2</SUB> forcing of the reduced value. Because of adjustment, the overall precipitation response to solar forcing is similar to, or less than the response to CO<SUB>2</SUB> forcing, despite being smaller per unit temperature change., The formation and evolution of massive red galaxies form a crucial test of theories of galaxy formation based on hierarchical assembly. In this Letter we use observations of the clustering of luminous red galaxies from the Boötes field and N-body simulations to argue that about 1/3 of the most luminous satellite galaxies appear to undergo merging or disruption within massive halos between z~=0.9 and 0.5., Minor mergers of galaxies are expected to be common in a hierarchical cosmology such as Λ cold dark matter. Though less disruptive than major mergers, minor mergers are more frequent and thus have the potential to affect galactic structure significantly. In this paper, we dissect the case-by-case outcome from a set of numerical simulations of a single satellite elliptical galaxy accreting on to a massive elliptical galaxy. We take care to explore cosmologically relevant orbital parameters and to set up realistic initial galaxy models that include all three relevant dynamical components: dark matter haloes, stellar bulges, and central massive black holes (BHs). The effects of several different parameters are considered, including orbital energy and angular momentum, satellite density and inner density profile, satellite-to-host mass ratio, and presence of a BH at the centre of the host. BHs play a crucial role in protecting the shallow stellar cores of the hosts, as satellites merging on to a host with a central BH are more strongly disrupted than those merging on to hosts without BHs. Orbital parameters play an important role in determining the degree of disruption: satellites on less-bound or more-eccentric orbits are more easily destroyed than those on more-bound or more-circular orbits as a result of an increased number of pericentric passages and greater cumulative effects of gravitational shocking and tidal stripping. In addition, satellites with densities typical of faint elliptical galaxies are disrupted relatively easily, while denser satellites can survive much better in the tidal field of the host. Over the range of parameters explored, we find that the accretion of a single satellite elliptical galaxy can result in a broad variety of changes, in both signs, in the surface brightness profile and colour of the central part of an elliptical galaxy. Our results show that detailed properties of the stellar components of merging satellites can strongly affect the properties of the remnants., Many space plasma models use magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) theory with the approximation that the high conductivity of plasmas does not support electric fields in the fluid frame (ideal approximation). We will show that physics is consistent only if the small electric field is included. Even then, MHD theory requires knowledge about collisionless conductivity for which there is little information. MHD theory has other restrictions that make it inapplicable to collisionless space plasmas. We apply MHD and ideal MHD concepts to observations and discuss why they are not adequate. There is an urgent need to develop kinetic models that correctly describe space plasmas., , Lie group methods provide a valuable tool for examining invariance and non-uniqueness associated with geophysical inverse problems. The techniques are particularly well suited for the study of non-linear inverse problems. Using the infinitesimal generators of the group it is possible to move within the null space in an iterative fashion. The key computational step in determining the symmetry groups associated with an inverse problem is the singular value decomposition of a sparse matrix. I apply the methodology to the eikonal equation and examine the possible solutions associated with a crosswell tomographic experiment. Results from a synthetic test indicate that it is possible to vary the velocity model significantly and still fit the reference arrival times. The approach is also applied to data from crosswell surveys conducted before and after a CO<SUB>2</SUB> injection at the Lost Hills field in California. The results highlight the fact that a fault cross-cutting the region between the wells may act as a conduit for the flow of water and CO<SUB>2</SUB>., Every 5.5 years, η Carinae experiences a dramatic ``spectroscopic event'' when high-excitation lines in its UV, optical, and IR spectrum disappear, and its hard X-ray and radio continuum flux crash. This periodicity has been attributed to an eccentric binary system with a shell ejection occurring at periastron. In addition, η Car shows long term changes as it is still recovering from its giant 19th century outburst. Both types of variability are directly linked to the current mass-loss rate and dust formation in its wind. Mid-IR images and spectra with T-ReCS provide a direct measure of changes in the current bolometric luminosity and trace dust formation episodes. This will provide a direct measurement of the mass ejected. Near-IR emission lines trace related changes in the post-event wind and ionization changes in the circumstellar environment needed to test specific models for the cause of η Car's variability as it recovers from its recent ``event''. High resolution near-IR spectra with GNIRS will continue the important work of HST/STIS, investigating changes in the direct and reflected spectrum of the stellar wind, and ionization changes in the nebula., This paper presents new U-Th/He crystallization and <SUP>3</SUP>He exposure ages on olivine for a suite of basalt samples from the Snake River Plain, Idaho. The results provide the first demonstration that U-Th/He geochronology can be successfully applied to Late Quaternary basalts using measurements of olivine phenocrysts as opposed to U-rich minerals. The approach employs abrasion to remove the outer rinds of olivine crystals to avoid problems with <SUP>4</SUP>He implantation from the groundmass, and a specially designed extraction system that allows U, Th and He concentrations and isotopic compositions to be measured on the same olivine grains. We demonstrate the viability of the U-Th/He technique on basalts with ages of 373 ka and 3400 ka previously dated by Ar-Ar, and show that concurrent measurements of U-Th- <SUP>4</SUP>He ages and <SUP>3</SUP>He cosmogenic exposure ages improve the accuracy of both methods. The combined U-Th- <SUP>4</SUP>He- <SUP>3</SUP>He technique is applied to a series of boulders and flows from Box Canyon near Hagerman, Idaho, to evaluate the ages of the basalts and to use exposure ages to make inferences about the age and mode of formation of the canyon. The U-Th/He ages of the Box Canyon basalts are between 86 ± 12 ka and 130 ± 12 ka (1-sigma errors) and suggest at least two periods of eruption. The ages are similar to a ca. 95 ka Ar-Ar age previously assigned, and distinguish the Box Canyon basalts from nearby ca. 395 ka basalt. Exposure ages of boulders within the canyon at the mouth, head and middle of Box Canyon are 21 ± 1, 19 ± 3 and 48 ± 3 ka; scoured bedrock at the canyon head has an exposure age of 45 ± 5 ka. These data indicate that the canyon was carved before the Bonneville Flood., Outflows from young stars play a major role in star formation, both by removing angular momentum from circumstellar disks (and thus enabling accretion to continue), and by driving turbulence in molecular clouds (and thereby regulating the efficiency of star formation). But the precise physical mechanism powering these jets remains unclear, with the X-wind and disk-wind models offering different theories of magnetocentrifugal jet acceleration. While present observations lack the angular resolution to directly distinguish between the competing theories, high angular resolution observations can nonetheless place indirect constraints on jet models by measuring the physical conditions, mass flux, and collimation of jets. Combined optical/IR spectra offer unprecedented capabilities for sensitively diagnosing the physical conditions in jets. Line ratios of [O I], [S II], [Fe II], [P II] and other species indicate the temperature, density, ionization fraction, and depletion of refractory elements in jets. Measuring these quantities allows calculation of the mass flux, a key measurement for constraining jet models. Both optical and IR spectra together are required for the full suite of diagnostics. We have recently demonstrated the ability to obtain the necessary near-IR observations at very high angular resolution using LGS AO and the new integral field spectrograph OSIRIS at Keck Observatory to observe jets from Herbig Ae stars. It is important to study jets around the massive Herbig Ae stars as well as those around T Tauri stars in order to understand how properties such as mass flux and velocity scale with stellar mass. Our OSIRIS observations of the Herbig Ae Star LkHa 233 show a narrow, tightly collimated, and clumpy jet seen in [Fe II] emission. LkHa 233's jet is very similar in morphology to that of the lower-mass T Tauri star HH 30, but more quantitative comparisons of physical conditions and mass flux are needed. Our OSIRIS near-IR data alone allow only a few of the line ratio diagnostics, but not all; in particular optical spectra are needed to measure the temperature and ionization fraction, both critical quantities for calculating the mass flux. Here we propose to use the GMOS IFU to obtain an optical spectrum of the same jet. Together the GMOS optical and OSIRIS near-IR spectra will enable the most detailed measurements ever of the physical conditions in a Herbig Ae star jet., The clustering of dark haloes depends not only on their mass but also on their assembly history, a dependence we term `assembly bias'. Using a galaxy formation model grafted on to the Millennium Simulation of the ΛCDM cosmogony, we study how assembly bias affects galaxy clustering. We compare the original simulation to `shuffled' versions where the galaxy populations are randomly swapped among haloes of similar mass, thus isolating the effects of correlations between assembly history and environment at fixed mass. Such correlations are ignored in the halo occupation distribution models often used populate dark matter simulations with galaxies, but they are significant in our more realistic simulation. Assembly bias enhances two-point correlations by 10 per cent for galaxies with brighter than -17, but suppresses them by a similar amount for galaxies brighter than -20. When such samples are split by colour, assembly bias is 5 per cent stronger for red galaxies and 5 per cent weaker for blue ones. Halo central galaxies are differently affected by assembly bias than are galaxies of all types. It almost doubles the correlation amplitude for faint red central galaxies. Shuffling galaxies among haloes of fixed formation redshift or concentration in addition to fixed mass produces biases which are not much smaller than when mass alone is fixed. Assembly bias must reflect a correlation of environment with aspects of halo assembly which are not encoded in either of these parameters. It induces effects which could compromise precision measurements of cosmological parameters from large galaxy surveys., We have obtained high S/N moderate and high resolution Gemini and Keck spectra of the Ly(alpha) forests of a large sample of projected pairs of quasars with z&gt; 2 and sub-arcminute separations. In these extremely rare sightlines, Ly(alpha) absorption, as measured in the background quasar spectrum, can be used to study the environment, emission geometry, and emission history of the foreground quasar, provided that the systemic redshift of the foreground quasar is known accurately. We propose to obtain low dispersion (R 1100) H-band spectra of 24 sub-arcminute z &gt; 2 projected pairs of quasars, with NIRI and GNIRS to determine systemic redshifts from the narrow [OIII] (lambda) 5008 emission line accurate to 30km s^- 1. This will eliminate the current 4 hmpc uncertainty in the foreground quasars' radial position, resolving transverse length scales as small as 20 hkpc. We will then be able to precisely characterize the transverse proximity effect, measure the cross- correlation function of quasars with optically thick neutral gas, constrain the geometry of quasar emission and the quasar emission history on timescales from 8 × 10^4 to 3 × 10^6 years, and gain insights into the fluorescent recombination radiation emitted by Lyman limit systems illuminated by ultraviolet photons., The clustering properties of dark matter halos are a firm prediction of modern theories of structure formation. We use two large-volume, high-resolution N-body simulations to study how the correlation function of massive dark matter halos depends on their mass, assembly history, and recent merger activity. We find that halos with the lowest concentrations are currently more clustered than those of higher concentration, the size of the effect increasing with halo mass; this agrees with trends found in studies of lower mass halos. The clustering dependence on other characterizations of the full mass accretion history appears weaker than the effect with concentration. Using the integrated correlation function, marked correlation functions, and a power-law fit to the correlation function, we find evidence that halos that have recently undergone a major merger or a large mass gain have slightly enhanced clustering relative to a randomly chosen population with the same mass distribution., We present a new method, fan-beam modulation, for observing weak extended x-ray sources with the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). This space-based solar x-ray and γ-ray telescope has much greater sensitivity than previous experiments in the 3-25 keV range, but is normally not well suited to detecting extended sources since their signal is not modulated by RHESSI's rotating grids. When the spacecraft is offpointed from the target source, however, the fan-beam modulation time-modulates the transmission by shadowing resulting from exploiting the finite thickness of the grids. In this article we detail how the technique is implemented and verify its consistency with sources with clear known signals that have occurred during RHESSI offpointing: microflares and the Crab Nebula. In both cases the results are consistent with previous and complementary measurements. Preliminary work indicates that this new technique allows RHESSI to observe the integrated hard x-ray spectrum of weak extended sources on the quiet Sun., We have conducted a thorough and blind search for emission lines in &gt;70 Swift X-ray afterglows of total exposure ~10<SUP>7</SUP> s. We find that most afterglows are consistent with pure power laws plus extinction. Significant outliers to the population exist at the 5%-10% level and have anomalously soft, possibly thermal spectra. Four bursts are singled out via possible detections of two to five lines: GRB 060218, GRB 060202, GRB 050822, and GRB 050714B. Alternatively, a blackbody model with kT~0.1-0.5 keV can describe the soft emission in each afterglow. The most significant soft-component detections in the full data set of ~2000 spectra correspond to GRB 060218/SN 2006aj, with line significances ranging up to ~20 σ. A thermal plasma model fit to the data indicates that the flux is primarily due to L-shell transitions of Fe at roughly solar abundance. We associate (&gt;4 σ significant) line triggers in the three other events with K-shell transitions in light metals. We favor a model where the possible line emission in these afterglows arises from the mildly relativistic cocoon of matter surrounding the GRB jet as it penetrates and exits the surface of the progenitor star. The emitting material in each burst is at a similar distance ~10<SUP>12</SUP>-10<SUP>13</SUP> cm, a similar density ~10<SUP>17</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, and subject to a similar flux of ionizing radiation. The lines may correlate with the X-ray flaring. For the blackbody interpretation, the soft flux may arise from breakout of the GRB shock or plasma cocoon from the progenitor stellar wind, as recently suggested for GRB 060218 (Campana et al. 2006). Due to the low z of GRB 060218, bursts faint in gamma rays with fluxes dominated by this soft X-ray component could outnumber classical GRBs 100 to 1., Context: To investigate the formation of sub-stellar objects, we observed a sample of ultracool dwarf members of the Upper Scorpius OB association. <BR />Aims: The properties of disks, such as their composition, life-time, and frequency compared to the accretor frequency, provide important clues to the mechanisms responsible for the formation of stellar and sub-stellar objects. <BR />Methods: We report the results of mid-IR observations with VISIR at the VLT of 10 ultracool dwarf members of the nearby Upper Scorpius OB association in four filters ranging from 8.59 (PAH1) to 12.8 μm (Ne II) and one brown dwarf obserbed with Spitzer between 3.6 and 24 μm. <BR />Results: Seven of our targets were detected in at least one of the bands, and we derived upper limits on the fluxes of the remaining 4. These results combined with previous studies from the literature lead to an improved disk frequency of 50±12%. This frequency is significantly higher than for accretors (16.3%±6.2%). Only one object showing mid-IR excess also has Hα emission at a level that indicates it must be accreting. Four of the detected targets are multiple system candidates. <BR />Conclusions: .The observed disk frequency for sub-stellar objects in the Upper Scorpius association is similar to that of stars, consistent with a common formation scenario. It is also similar to the disk fractions observed in younger clusters, suggesting that the disk lifetimes might be longer for ultracool dwarfs than for higher-mass stars. <P />Based on observations made with ESO Telescopes at the Paranal Observatories under program ID 075.C-0148., With close pairs of quasars at different redshifts, a background quasar sight line can be used to study a foreground quasar's environment in absorption. We used a sample of 17 Lyman limit systems with column density N<SUB>HI</SUB>&gt;10<SUP>19</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> selected from 149 projected quasar pair sight lines to investigate the clustering pattern of optically thick absorbers around luminous quasars at z~2.5. Specifically, we measured the quasar-absorber correlation function in the transverse direction and found a comoving correlation length of r<SUB>0</SUB>=9.2<SUP>+1.5</SUP><SUB>-1.7</SUB> h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc (comoving), assuming a power-law correlation function ξ~r<SUP>-γ</SUP>, with γ=1.6. Applying this transverse clustering strength to the line of sight, would predict that ~15%-50% of all quasars should show a N<SUB>HI</SUB>&gt;10<SUP>19</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> absorber within a velocity window of Δv&lt;3000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. This overpredicts the number of absorbers along the line of sight by a large factor, providing compelling evidence that the clustering pattern of optically thick absorbers around quasars is highly anisotropic. The most plausible explanation for the anisotropy is that the transverse direction is less likely to be illuminated by ionizing photons than the line of sight, and that absorbers along the line of sight are being photoevaporated. A simple model for the photoevaporation of absorbers subject to the ionizing flux of a quasar is presented, and it is shown that absorbers with volume densities n<SUB>H</SUB>&lt;~0.1 will be photoevaporated if they lie within ~1 Mpc (proper) of a luminous quasar. Using this simple model, we illustrate how comparisons of the transverse and line-of-sight clustering around quasars can ultimately be used to constrain the distribution of gas in optically thick absorption-line systems., Using a thermal-chemical model for the generic T Tauri disk of D'Alessio and colleagues, we estimate the strength of the fine-structure emission lines of Ne II and Ne III at 12.81 and 15.55 μm that arise from the warm atmosphere of the disk exposed to hard stellar X-rays. The Ne ions are produced by the absorption of keV X-rays from the K shell of neutral Ne, followed by the Auger ejection of several additional electrons. The recombination of the Ne ions is slow because of weak charge transfer with atomic hydrogen in the case of Ne<SUP>+2</SUP> and by essentially no charge transfer for Ne<SUP>+</SUP>. For a distance of 140 pc, the 12.81 μm line of Ne II has a flux ~10<SUP>-14</SUP> ergs cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which should be observable with the Spitzer Infrared Spectrometer and suitable ground-based instrumentation. The detection of these fine-structure lines would clearly demonstrate the effects of X-rays on the physical and chemical properties of the disks of young stellar objects and provide a diagnostic of the warm gas in protoplanetary disk atmospheres. They would complement the observed H<SUB>2</SUB> and CO emission by probing vertical heights above the molecular transition layer and larger radial distances that include the location of terrestrial and giant planets., We present Arecibo L-band Feed Array 21 cm observations of a subcomplex of HVCs at the tip of the anticenter complex. These observations show morphological details that point to interaction with the ambient halo medium and differential drag within the cloud subcomplex. We develop a new technique for measuring cloud distances, which relies on these observed morphological and kinematic characteristics, and show that it is consistent with Hα distances. These results are consistent with distances to HVCs and halo densities derived from models in which HVCs are formed from cooling halo gas., We have developed techniques to probe cosmic strings and non-Gaussianity through Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. In the cosmic string search effort, we devised techniques and applied them to identify the impediments that blur the signals from cosmic strings and analyze their effects quantitatively by running simulations. We have introduced a new method to detect non-Gaussian feature in the cosmic microwave background anisotropy and calibrated its performance through computer simulations., The coupling of photons and baryons by Thomson scattering in the early universe imprints features in both the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and matter power spectra. The former have been used to constrain a host of cosmological parameters, the latter have the potential to strongly constrain the expansion history of the universe and dark energy. Key to this program is the means to localize the primordial features in observations of galaxy spectra which necessarily involve galaxy bias, non-linear evolution and redshift space distortions. We present calculations, based on mock catalogs produced from high-resolution N-body simulations, which show the range of behaviors we might expect of galaxies in the real universe. We investigate physically motivated fitting forms which include the effects of non-linearity, galaxy bias and redshift space distortions and discuss methods for analysis of upcoming data. In agreement with earlier work, we find that a survey of several Gpc<SUP>3</SUP> would constrain the sound horizon at z ∼ 1 to about 1%., In-flight calibrations are an essential component of any experiment plan for space-based instruments. These calibrations are necessary not only to verify instrument response and correct for instrument degradation, but also to identify unforeseen changes in response. Verifying proper operation after launch is necessary since the instrument has just experienced large stresses, both thermal and mechanical. In addition, post-launch is often the first time the instrument will experience the full spectrum of spaceflight perturbations, UV photon exposure, and particle flux levels. These perturbations result from the space environment, on-board subsystems, other experiments, or from some combination of these. The experimenter must develop procedures for in-flight testing and calibration of the instrument to assure its proper operation and to provide reliable data to the scientific community. Once an instrument is launched into space, the science team will spend several weeks in a ""commissioning phase"" where instrument turn on is done step by step, proper instrument operation confirmed at each step, and inter-experiment compatibility verified. The extended time for this check-out reflects both the limits of real time ground communication, and a general caution during instrument commanding since any mistake could be catastrophic. This check-out does not end with the commissioning phase. Several months of intense data monitoring are normally required just to confirm that the instrument is operating as planned. For interplanetary missions, this commissioning may take place several years after launch. Once proper operation has been confirmed, the instrument team must perform in-flight calibration checks to both confirm and possibly refine the calibrations determined on the ground. In-flight calibrations may be a one-time event to confirm a pre-launch value, or may be an ongoing effort throughout the life of the mission. These calibrations may include ""relative calibrations"" that account for variations in instrument sensitivity with look direction or particle energy, and ""absolute calibrations"", which are used to determine overall sensitivity and accuracy of the particle flux measurements., We have used the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys coronagraph to make the first polarization maps of the AU Microscopii debris disk. The polarization rises from 5% at 20 AU to 40% at 80 AU. The polarization is perpendicular to the disk, indicating that the scattered light originates from micron-sized grains in an optically thin disk. Disk models show that interior to the ``birth ring'' (40-50 AU) there is a hole in the dust distribution where micron-sized dust is depleted by a factor of more than 300. The disk is collision dominated, and grains that fall inward due to drag forces undergo a destructive collision. The presence of this hole implies that the localized enhancements in surface brightness that occur at projected radii interior to the birth ring are caused by nonaxisymmetric structures in the outer disk. The grains exhibit strong forward scattering and high polarization. Spherical grains composed of conventional materials cannot reproduce these optical properties. A Mie/Maxwell-Garnett analysis demands highly porous (91%-94%) particles. In the inner solar system, porous particles form in cometary dust, where the sublimation of ices leaves a ``bird's nest'' of refractory material. In AU Mic, the grain porosity may be primordial, because the dust birth ring lies beyond the ice sublimation point. The observed porosities span the range of values implied by laboratory studies of particle coagulation by ballistic cluster-cluster aggregation. To avoid compactification, the upper size limit for the parent bodies is in the decimeter range, in agreement with theoretical predictions based on collisional lifetime arguments. Consequently, AU Mic may exhibit the signature of the primordial agglomeration process whereby interstellar grains first assembled to form macroscopic objects., We investigate the diffuse absolute calibration of the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) at 8.0μm using a sample of 43 HII regions with a wide range of morphologies near l = 312°. For each region we carefully measure sky-subtracted, point-source-subtracted, areally integrated IRAC 8.0-μm fluxes and compare these with Midcourse Space eXperiment (MSX) 8.3-μm images at two different spatial resolutions, and with radio continuum maps. We determine an accurate median ratio of IRAC8.0-μm/MSX8.3-μm fluxes, of 1.55 +/- 0.15. From robust spectral energy distributions of these regions we conclude that the present 8.0-μm diffuse calibration of the SST is 36 per cent too high compared with the MSX validated calibration, perhaps due to scattered light inside the camera. This is an independent confirmation of the result derived for the diffuse calibration of IRAC by the Spitzer Science Centre (SSC). <P />From regression analyses we find that 843-MHz radio fluxes of HII regions and mid-infrared (MIR) fluxes are linearly related for MSX at 8.3μm and Spitzer at 8.0μm, confirming the earlier MSX result by Cohen &amp; Green. The median ratio of MIR/843-MHz diffuse continuum fluxes is 600× smaller in non-thermal than thermal regions, making it a sharp discriminant. The ratios are largely independent of morphology up to a size of ~24arcmin. We provide homogeneous radio and MIR morphologies for all sources. MIR morphology is not uniquely related to radio structure. Compact regions may have MIR filaments and/or diffuse haloes, perhaps infrared counterparts to weakly ionized radio haloes found around compact HII regions. We offer two IRAC colour-colour plots as quantitative diagnostics of diffuse HII regions., Starting with the first detection of an afterglow from a short-duration hard-spectrum γ-ray burst (SHB) by Swift last year, a growing body of evidence has suggested that SHBs are associated with an older and lower redshift galactic population than long-soft GRBs and, in a few cases, with large (&gt;~10 kpc) projected offsets from the centers of their putative host galaxies. Here we present observations of the field of GRB 060502B, a SHB detected by Swift and localized by the X-Ray Telescope (XRT). We find a massive red galaxy at a redshift of z=0.287 at an angular distance of 17.1<SUP>''</SUP> from our revised XRT position. Using associative and probabilistic arguments, we suggest that this galaxy hosted the progenitor of GRB 060502B. If true, this offset would correspond to a physical displacement of 73+/-19 kpc in projection, about twice the largest offset inferred for any SHB to date and almost an order of magnitude larger than a typical long-soft burst offset. Spectra and modeling of the star formation history of this possible host show it to have undergone a large ancient starburst. If the progenitor of GRB 060502B was formed in this starburst episode, the time of the GRB explosion since birth is τ~1.3+/-0.2 Gyr and the minimum kick velocity of the SHB progenitor is v<SUB>kick,min</SUB>=55+/-15 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>., The <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar dating technique requires the use of neutron fluence monitors (standards). Precise calibrations of these standards are crucial to decrease the uncertainties associated with <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar dates. Optimal calibration of <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar standards should be based on K/Ar standards having independent isotope dilution measurements of <SUP>40</SUP>K and <SUP>40</SUP>Ar*, based on independent isotope tracers (spikes) because this offers the possibility to eliminate random interlaboratory errors. In this study, we calibrate the widely used Fish Canyon sanidine (FCs) standard based on four primary K/Ar standards (GA-1550, Hb3gr, NL-25, and GHC-305) on which K and Ar* concentrations have been determined in different labs with independently calibrated tracers. We obtained a mean age of 28.03 ± 0.08 Ma (1 σ; neglecting uncertainties of the <SUP>40</SUP>K decay constants) for FCs, based on the decay constant recommended by Steiger and Jäger [Steiger R.H., Jäger. E. 1977. Subcommission on geochronology: convention of the use of decay constants in geo- and cosmochronology. Earth Planet. Sci. Lett.36, 359-362.]. This age corresponds to a mean <SUP>40</SUP>Ar*/ <SUP>40</SUP>K value of (1.6407 ± 0.0047) × 10 <SUP>-3</SUP>. We also discuss several criteria that prevent the use of previous calibrations of FCs based on other primary standards (LP-6, SB-3 and MMhb-1). The age of FCs obtained in this study is based on the <SUP>40</SUP>K decay constants of Steiger and Jäger (1977) but we anticipate the imminent need for revision of the value and precision of the <SUP>40</SUP>K decay constants (representing the main source of uncertainties in <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar dating). The <SUP>40</SUP>Ar*/ <SUP>40</SUP>K result of FCs obtained in this study allows therefore a rapid calibration of the age of FCs with uncertainties at the 0.29% level but perhaps more importantly this value is independent of any particular value of the <SUP>40</SUP>K decay constants and may be used in the future in conjunction with revised decay constants., We have successfully detected solar neutrons at ground level in association with the X17.0 solar flare that occurred on 2005 September 7. Observations were made with the solar neutron telescopes and neutron monitors located in Bolivia and Mexico. In this flare, large fluxes of hard X-rays and γ-rays were observed by the GEOTAIL and the INTEGRAL satellites. The INTEGRAL observations include the 4.4 MeV line γ-rays of <SUP>12</SUP>C. The data suggest that solar neutrons were produced at the same time as these hard electromagnetic radiations. We have however found an apparent discrepancy between the observed and the expected time profiles. This fact suggests a possible extended neutron emission., , Our understanding of planet formation rests on the observation of planetary systems over their lifetimes. The majority of known extrasolar planets are expected to have formed through a process of core accretion, by which solid planetesimals grow into embryos which sweep up gas in circumstellar disks. Observations of circumstellar disks provide a window into these processes. In particular, dusty debris produced by the destruction of primitive planetesimals can trace the characteristics and spatial distribution of these planetesimals, as well as test for the presence of planets. Debris disks are faint relative to their host stars, and advanced techniques are required to directly image the light scattered by the dust. I examine some of the challenges to high-contrast observations of circumstellar debris disks. I investigate the formation and statistics of stellar ""speckles"" in adaptively corrected images, which constitute a limiting noise source in high-contrast imaging. The ability for adaptive optics coronagraphy to image debris disks is examined in the context of understanding the processes of planet formation. I present an investigation using adaptive optics coronagraphy of the debris disk around AU Microscopii, a young low-mass star whose disk can be directly compared with that of the archetypal bPictoris. I also present the discovery of a ring of warm dust around HD 32297, investigate the range of disk architectures allowed by my observations, and probe the processes responsible for the distribution of dust around this star., We present a global map of the amplitude of Mars' crustal magnetic field at 170-km altitude based on electron reflectometry, using data from the Magnetometer/Electron Reflectometer (MAG/ER) experiment on board Mars Global Surveyor. This new map contains features that are about seven times weaker than those in previously published maps obtained with the MAG alone from the 400-km-altitude mapping orbit. The increased sensitivity and nearly complete sampling reveal numerous weak magnetic sources in the northern lowlands. A group of these sources forms a nearly complete ring surrounding the Utopia basin, coinciding with a ridge of thickened crust. A larger 5800-km-diameter ring is defined by a ∼120° arc of magnetic sources that extend to the north pole, supporting the hypothesis that part of the dichotomy boundary was established or modified by the Utopia impact. We also map the magnetic signatures of the Hellas, Argyre, and Isidis impact basins with increased dynamic range, confirming the large contrast in magnetic field strength between the basin interior and surroundings. Magnetic sources surround most of the Tharsis rise, except in the north, suggesting that the construction of Tharsis thermally demagnetized a large region of the northern lowlands. Thermal demagnetization is also suggested in the Elysium region, which intersects the inner Utopia magnetic ring, and south of the Hellas basin in the vicinity of Peneus Patera and Amphitrites Patera., Peak fluxes are an important property of gradual solar energetic particle (SEP) event time profiles from both astro/heliophysical and applications perspectives. However, the peak flux in an event may occur at the event onset, or at the time of the interplanetary shock arrival (the ESP or energetic storm particles). This makes an important difference in the interpretation of the peak flux, and in any attempts to characterize or model it. This paper describes a study of SEP data sets from ACE, IMP-8 and GOES toward determining the relative properties of these peak fluxes for protons with energies near 1, 10, and 50 MeV. The results suggest that for gradual events with both peaks, the ESP peak often dominates at 1 MeV energies and is dominant about half the time at 10 MeV. Moreover, the prompt peak fluxes can be used to estimate the shock peak (ESP event) up to days ahead, especially in the lower energy range., Cycloidal crack patterns on Europa are influenced by tides induced by orbital eccentricity, which in turn is driven by the Laplace orbital resonance. Their shapes potentially record the location of their formation (relative to the direction of Jupiter), as well as the parameters of crack formation. Hoppa et al. [Hoppa, G., Tufts, B.R., Greenberg, R., Geissler, P., 1999a. Icarus 141, 287-298] modeled several cycloid chains using a fixed set of material parameters, but some details did not fit. We now allow material parameters to vary for each arc of an observed cycloid. In general, with minimal variation of model parameters between the arcs, fits are greatly improved. Furthermore, accounting for tidal stress accumulated during non-synchronous rotation, in addition to diurnal stress, allows even better fits. Even with the added freedom in the model our fits allow us to better constrain the location where each cycloid may have formed. Our results support Hoppa et al.'s finding that only a few cracks form ridges per cycle of non-synchronous rotation in the region examined, probably because cracking relieves built up stress until further substantial rotation occurs., We compute the expected number of quasars multiply imaged by cluster-size dark halos for current wide-field quasar surveys by carrying out a large ensemble of ray-tracing simulations through clusters from a cosmological N-body simulation of the ΛCDM cosmology, with power spectrum normalization σ<SUB>8</SUB>=0.95. Our calculation predicts ~4 quasar lenses with splittings θ&gt;10<SUP>''</SUP> in the SDSS spectroscopic quasar sample, consistent with the recent discovery of the wide separation lens SDSS J1004+4112, which has θ=14.6<SUP>''</SUP>. The SDSS faint photometric quasar survey will contain ~12 multiply imaged quasars with splittings θ&gt;10<SUP>''</SUP>. Of these, ~2 will be lenses with θ&gt;30<SUP>''</SUP>, and ~2 will be at high redshift (z<SUB>s</SUB>~4)., I have investigated the relationship between the characteristics of stars, and the occurrence and orbital properties of their planetary companions. I explored these relationships by searching for planets around extremely low-mass M Dwarfs, high-mass subgiants, and metal-rich, main-sequence stars. Several recent studies have shown that stellar metallicity is a strong tracer for planet occurrence. I worked with the ""Next 2000 Stars"" (N2K) Consortium to use a quick-look observing strategy to search for short-period ""hot Jupiters"" around nearby metal-rich stars. For this project, I developed a modification to the iodine cell Doppler technique that eliminates the need for an observed stellar template spectrum, and I used this technique to detect three new hot Jupiters. Theoretical work in the context of the core accretion planet formation model has predicted that stellar mass is another tracer of planet occurrence. I tested this prediction by searching for Jovian planets orbiting low-mass, M dwarf stars as part of the NASA Keck M Dwarfs Survey. I present the detection of only the second Jupiter-mass planetary companion orbiting an M dwarf, GL 849. I also study the relationship between stellar mass and planet occurrence by comparing the fraction of low-mass stars with planets to the corresponding fraction of Sun-like stars with planets. In addition to searching for planets around low-mass stars, I probed the high-mass end of the stellar mass distribution by searching for giant planets orbiting intermediate-mass subgiant stars. I present the detection of a rare, eccentric hot Jupiter orbiting the 1.28 [Special characters omitted.] subgiant HD 185269, and 3 new exoplanets orbiting ""retired"" (evolved) A-type stars. I use these detections to explore the relationship between the occurrence and properties of giant planets, and the mass of their host stars., We analyzed a series of solar energetic particle events in late April and early May of 1998, during which lunar surface potentials reached values as large as ~-4.5 kV (the largest recorded by Lunar Prospector). The two largest surface charging events during this time period correspond to energetic particle injections, when the electron flux between 50 keV and 5 MeV exceeded the proton flux over the same energy range. We searched the entire Lunar Prospector data set for other large negative surface charging events, and found that they occur almost exclusively during magnetotail crossings (when the Moon encounters the plasmasheet) and solar energetic particle events. Lunar surface charging (and its effect on the lunar dust environment) during inherently unpredictable space weather events represents a significant hazard for exploration., Ground-based radio astronomical observations of planetary objects provide information that is complementary to that obtained at other (visual, infrared, ultraviolet) wavelengths. We distinguish between thermal and nonthermal emissions. Thermal radio emission originates from a body's surface (or more appropriately subsurface) and/or atmosphere, and nonthermal radio emissions are produced by charged particles in a planet's magnetosphere. The thermal emission can be used to deduce the structure and composition of a planet's atmosphere and surface layers; the nonthermal radiation provides information about its magnetic field and charged particle distributions therein. Ground-based radio astronomy is essentially limited to frequencies above about 10 MHz because of the shielding effects of Earth's ionosphere at lower frequencies. Space-based measurements extend the frequency range of solar system radio astronomy as low as a few kHz. In this chapter, we discuss radio emissions from a few kHz up to≳&gt;500 GHz. Since we cover over 9 orders of magnitude in frequency, we can include only brief summaries of a select number of topics., This paper describes the status of four CMB cosmology experiments which are currently being developed by the Berkeley group. These include the APEXSZ and South Pole Telescope searches for clusters of galaxies using the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and the Polar Bear and EBEX CMB polarization anisotropy experiments. These experiments exploit new detector technologies with Superconducting TES bolometers and frequency domain output multiplexing, which has been developed at Berkeley., Interferometric measurements of late-type stars using the Infrared Spatial Interferometer (ISI) are reported. The ISI is a three-element array of movable telescopes using heterodyne detection in the mid-infrared. The mobility of the telescopes allows measurement of stars to be taken using a variety of array configurations and baseline lengths. The heterodyne detection scheme results in very narrow bandwidth measurements of about 12.6 GHz and allows measurements to be made away from obvious spectral lines. The details of the operation of the ISI are discussed along with the science targets of primary interest: late-type stars. <P />Measurements of stellar dust shells have been made with the ISI in a linear east-west configuration with baselines of 4, 8, and 12m. From these data, one- dimensional imaging of dust around late-type stars is discussed and demonstrated for the case of R Leonis, which shows obvious asymmetry. Various mechanisms for creating this asymmetry, including influence from the companion, are discussed. Also, in 2006 the telescopes were moved into a triangular array with longer baselines of approximately 35-40 m. Measurements at the higher resolution provided by these longer baselines show asymmetry in the stars a Orionis and R Leonis. The star o Ceti is found, however, to be quite symmetric and is circular to within the accuracy of these measurements., , We present the clustering of Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe 2 (DEEP2) galaxies at 0.7&lt;z&lt;1.4 around quasars identified using both the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and DEEP2 surveys. We measure the two-point cross-correlation of a sample of 36 optically selected, spectroscopically identified quasars from the SDSS and 16 more found in the DEEP2 survey with the full DEEP2 galaxy sample over scales 0.1 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc&lt;r<SUB>p</SUB>&lt;10 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc. The clustering amplitude is found to be similar to the autocorrelation function of DEEP2 galaxies, with a relative bias of b=0.89+/-0.24 between quasars and DEEP2 galaxies at z~1. No significant dependence is found on scale, quasar luminosity, or redshift over the ranges we probe here. The clustering amplitude errors are comparable to those from significantly larger quasar samples, such as the 2dF (Two Degree Field) QSO Redshift Survey. This results from the statistical power of cross-correlation techniques, which exploit the fact that galaxies are much more numerous than quasars. We also measure the local environments of quasars using the third-nearest-neighbor surface density of surrounding DEEP2 galaxies. Quasars are found in regions of similar mean overdensity to blue DEEP2 galaxies; they differ in environment from the red DEEP2 galaxy population at 2 σ significance. Our results imply that quasars do not reside in particularly massive dark matter halos at these redshifts, with a mean dark matter halo mass of M<SUB>200</SUB>~3×10<SUP>12</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> in a concordance ΛCDM cosmology., This dissertation reports various results from the first large-scale observational survey of galaxy groups and clusters as they existed between ten and seven billion years ago, when the Universe was roughly half its present age. By observing such systems and comparing them to similar objects at more recent times, we can learn a great deal about the history and composition of the cosmos. To this end, we make use of data from the DEEP2 (Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe 2) Galaxy Redshift Survey. This large, spectroscopic survey was performed using the DEIMOS spectrograph on the Keck II telescope and has mapped the spatial distribution of some 40, 000 galaxies over three square degrees of the sky, focusing primarily on the redshift range 0.7 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.4. <P />We present four distinct studies relating to DEEP2 groups and clusters. First, we refine an automated group-finding algorithm, calibrate it for use with DEEP2 data, and construct a catalog of DEEP2 groups and clusters. We then analyze the color distribution of the galaxies in those systems, compared to the distribution for isolated galaxies, and we find substantial evolution in the former distribution, with important implications for the history of galaxy formation. Next, we present detailed observations of a single, interesting galaxy in DEEP2--the remnant of a collision between two red galaxies, formerly a group--which appears to host two active nuclei. Finally, we develop a theoretical framework within which it will soon be possible, using the abundance of DEEP2 groups and clusters, to place interesting constraints on cosmological parameters, including the equation of state of the dark energy., We review here recent numerical results concerning the acceleration and collimation of relativistic outflows from neutron stars, and we discuss their implications for models of magnetars in their hypothesized initial high rotation states. New results with different injection conditions and extending to much larger distance from the central star are also presented and discussed, showing that, only in the case of weakly magnetized winds, collimated outflows are indeed possible. We finally comment on the possibility that newly born magnetars might trigger GRBs, and we show that numerical results do not support such hypothesis., Using a new grism at the Keck Interferometer, we obtained spectrally dispersed (R~230) interferometric measurements of the Mira star R Vir. These data show that the measured radius of the emission varies substantially from 2.0 to 2.4 μm. Simple models can reproduce these wavelength-dependent variations using extended molecular layers, which absorb stellar radiation and reemit it at longer wavelengths. Because we observe spectral regions with and without substantial molecular opacity, we determine the stellar photospheric radius, uncontaminated by molecular emission. We infer that most of the molecular opacity arises at approximately twice the radius of the stellar photosphere., This paper studies high-frequency plasma waves during 28 encounters of the Wind spacecraft with solar wind reconnection exhausts. We use measurements by the Thermal Noise Receiver (TNR) and Time Domain Sampler (TDS) experiments on Wind/WAVES to survey characteristics of electron plasma waves and the most common regions where they are found. TNR spectrograms showed intense emission bursts ∼4 kHz (corresponding to the ion acoustic range) during 79% of the events while around the local electron plasma frequency intense emission bursts were recorded for 39% of the events. The TDS instrument, operating at 120,000 samples per second, detected three kinds of electric waveforms: Langmuir waves, electron solitary waves (ESW), and wave packets with frequencies between ion and electron plasma frequencies typically interpreted as Doppler-shifted ion acoustic waves. Except for one very intense ESW event, the average amplitudes for all these three waveform types were similar, below 1 mV/m. We found an increased probability to observe intense plasma wave activity when the reconnection X-line region was approached. Wave activity may be present anywhere in the reconnection exhaust, although the boundary region of the exhaust appears to be the most dynamic region for wave activity. In particular, the majority of the captured ESW occurred near the exhaust boundaries., We determine stellar parameters for the M dwarf GJ 436, which hosts a Neptune-mass planet. We employ primarily spectral modeling at low and high resolution, examining the agreement between model and observed optical spectra of five comparison stars of type M0-M3. The modeling of high-resolution optical spectra suffers from uncertainties in TiO transitions, affecting the predicted strengths of both atomic and molecular lines in M dwarfs. The determination of T<SUB>eff</SUB>, gravity, and metallicity from optical spectra remains at ~10%. As molecules provide opacity both in lines and as an effective continuum, determining molecular transition parameters remains a challenge facing models such as the PHOENIX series, best verified with high resolution and spectrophotometric spectra. Our analysis of GJ 436 yields an effective temperature of T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3350 +/- 300 K and a mass of 0.44 M<SUB>solar</SUB>. New Doppler measurements of GJ 436 with a precision of 3 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> taken during 6 years improve the Keplerian model of the planet, giving it a minimum mass Msini=0.0713M<SUB>Jup</SUB> = 22.6 M<SUB>⊕</SUB>, period P = 2.6439 days, and eccentricity e = 0.16 +/- 0.02. The noncircular orbit contrasts with the tidally circularized orbits of all close-in exoplanets, implying either ongoing pumping of eccentricity by a more distant companion, or a higher Q value for this low-mass planet. The velocities indeed reveal a long-term trend, indicating a possible distant companion., We present a detailed investigation into which properties of CDM halos make them effective strong gravitational lenses. Strong-lensing cross sections of 878 clusters from an N-body simulation are measured by ray-tracing through 13,594 unique projections. We measure concentrations, axis ratios, orientations, and the substructure of each cluster, and compare the lensing-weighted distribution of each quantity to that of the cluster population as a whole. The concentrations of lensing clusters are on average 34% larger than the typical cluster in the universe. Despite this bias, the anomalously high concentrations (c&gt;14) recently measured by several groups appear to be inconsistent with the concentration distribution in our simulations, which predict that &lt;2% of lensing clusters should have concentrations this high. No correlation is found between lensing cross section and substructure. We introduce several types of simplified dark matter halos and use them to isolate which properties of CDM clusters make them effective lenses. The abundance of giant arcs is primarily determined by the mass distribution within an average overdensity of ~10,000. A multiple-lens-plane ray-tracing algorithm is used to show that projections of large-scale structure increase the giant arc abundance modestly, by &lt;7%. We revisit the claimed excess of giant arcs behind high redshift clusters in the RCS survey and find that the number of high-redshift (z&gt;0.6) lenses is in good agreement with ΛCDM, although our simulations predict more low-redshift (z&lt;0.6) lenses than observed., , The recently introduced models of reionization bubbles based on extended Press-Schechter theory (by Furlanetto, Hernquist &amp; Zaldarriaga) are generalized to include mergers of ionization sources. Sources with a recent major merger are taken to have enhanced photon production due to star formation, and accretion on to a central black hole if a black hole is present. This produces a scatter in the number of ionized photons corresponding to a halo of a given mass and a change in photon production over time for any given halo mass. By extending previous methods, photon production histories, bubble distributions and ionization histories are computed for several different parameter and recombination assumptions. The resulting distributions interpolate between previously calculated limiting cases., We present the initial results from the Spitzer Survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud (S<SUP>3</SUP>MC), which imaged the star-forming body of the SMC in all seven MIPS and IRAC wave bands. We find that the F<SUB>8</SUB>/F<SUB>24</SUB> ratio (an estimate of PAH abundance) has large spatial variations and takes a wide range of values that are unrelated to metallicity but anticorrelated with 24 μm brightness and F<SUB>24</SUB>/F<SUB>70</SUB> ratio. This suggests that photodestruction is primarily responsible for the low abundance of PAHs observed in star-forming low-metallicity galaxies. We use the S<SUP>3</SUP>MC images to compile a photometric catalog of ~400,000 mid- and far-infrared point sources in the SMC. The sources detected at the longest wavelengths fall into four main categories: (1) bright 5.8 μm sources with very faint optical counterparts and very red mid-infrared colors ([5.8]-[8.0]&gt;1.2), which we identify as YSOs; (2) bright mid-infrared sources with mildly red colors (0.16&lt;~[5.8]-[8.0]&lt;0.6), identified as carbon stars; (3) bright mid-infrared sources with neutral colors and bright optical counterparts, corresponding to oxygen-rich evolved stars; and (4) unreddened early B stars (B3-O9) with a large 24 μm excess. This excess is reminiscent of debris disks and is detected in only a small fraction of these stars (&lt;~5%). The majority of the brightest infrared point sources in the SMC fall into groups 1-3. We use this photometric information to produce a catalog of 282 bright YSOs in the SMC with a very low level of contamination (~7%)., The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) has observed significant non- thermal emission up to ~70~keV from coronal sources prior to the impulsive phase in some flares, which has interesting implications for particle trapping and flare energy release. Images and spectra during the pre- impulsive phase of the GOES-class X4.8 event on 23~July~2002 suggests that the coronal hard X-ray (HXR) emission is non-thermal, as analysis of the Fe (~6.7~keV) and Fe/Ni (~8~keV) line complexes constrains the thermal component to have little or no thermal continuum emission above ~15~keV. The over-the-limb X3.1 event on 24~Aug~2002 displays similar spectral characteristics, and occultation of the footpoints places the non-thermal HXR emission unambiguously in the corona. RHESSI images of this event show an extended source below ~35~keV and a compact looptop source above ~35~keV, possibly indicating trapping of energetic electrons. Spatially-integrated spectra are well-fit by a broken power-law and the spectral indices above and below the break differ by ~2, suggesting an observation of the transition between thin- and thick-target bremsstrahlung. The collisional lifetime of non-thermal electrons is &lt;10~sec at the inferred densities of ~1011~cm-3 and the rising HXR flux thus suggests continuous particle injection. We apply the technique of Johns &amp;Lin (1992) to invert the pre-impulsive phase photon spectra and recover the original electron energy spectra as a function of time, both for spatially-integrated spectra and source-isolated spectra using imaging spectroscopy. We then compare the inverted spectra with a forward-modeling analysis of the photon spectra using the iron line analysis technique of Caspi &amp;Lin (2006) to constrain the thermal model. We compare the results for both 24~Aug~2002 and 23~Jul~2002, and discuss the implications for electron acceleration and flare plasma heating in the corona during this period., Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence plays a key role in many different astrophysical processes. One of the unanswered questions in physics of turbulence in magnetized plasmas, such as the solar wind, is the physics of dissipation in small scales (k ρ &gt; 1). In this study we present results of electric and magnetic field fluctuation spectra in 17 intervals observed in the solar wind near 1 AU using electric and magnetic field and plasma measurements from Cluster and ACE spacecrafts. In the inertial range electric fluctuaton spectra follow the classical fluid- like Kolmogorov behavior as previously observed. The fluid-like behavior breaks down near the ion thermal gyro-radius and we observe an enhancement in the electric spectrum while the magnetic spectrum becomes steeper. In the higher frequencies electric spectrum has a second breakpoint above which spectrum is enhanced even further. Importantly, we also show how breakpoints are organized according to different solar wind parameters, such as plasma beta and Alfvenic Mach number., Previous studies of the Martian interior have highlighted the difficulty in forming and maintaining plumes throughout the history of the planet. A deep, gravitationally stable layer at the base of the mantle, possibly produced by magma ocean crystallization followed by an overturn event, could provide a heat source for plumes and therefore a source of long-lasting, localized volcanism. To address the influence of a layered mantle on the thermal evolution of the Martian interior, we have run a series of numerical convection simulations with temperature-dependent viscosity in spherical geometry. 3D simulations were run to a steady state to investigate the effect that a deep layer and a crustal dichotomy would have on the generation of plumes and their spatial locations. 3D and 2D experiments were also used to access the accuracy of 1D thermal evolution models. The 1D models were modified to include melt generation, from both small-scale convection and plumes, to examine the effect that a layered mantle has on the magmatic history of Mars. Using our 1D models, we also determine the compositional density anomaly required for the layer to remain at the base of the mantle for the entire history of the planet; our scaling is consistent with the results of published numerical simulations. We find that a layer enriched in radiogenic elements is necessary to have layer generate plumes throughout the history of the planet. 1D models accurately predict the large-scale thermal evolution in the 2D and 3D models. 1D modeling indicates that the existence of the layer increases both the amount of melting and duration of melting. A layered mantle permits volcanism over the entire history of Mars., Observations of strong plasma wave activity near reconnection X-line regions in THE laboratory and in the Earth's magnetosphere have suggested that plasma waves may play AN important role in the reconnection process by providing anomalous resistivity through wave-particle interactions and by accelerating electrons. Recent observations of quasi-steady magnetic reconnection in the solar wind introduces an important new environment to study the role of plasma waves in a collisionless plasma associated with the reconnection process. We have used observations by the WIND spacecraft to study high frequency plasma waves associated with 28 solar wind reconnection exhausts. The TNR (Thermal Noise Receiver) experiment included in the WAVES instrument on WIND measures electric spectral density from 4 to 256 kHz and the TDS (Time Domain Sampler) experiment also included in WAVES samples electric field waveforms at rates up to 120,000 samples/s. A large fraction (79%) of the investigated events showed significant enhancements in the wave power around ~ 4 kHz, while only about one third (39%) of the exhausts were associated with intensifications around THE local electron plasma frequency (few tens of kHz). TDS waveform samples revealed three different wave modes: electron solitary waves, ion acoustic waves and Langmuir waves. The intense plasma waves were most frequently observed close to the X-line and near the exhaust boundaries, although wave emissions were commonly observed elsewhere within the exhausts as well, SEP events are normally classified as Gradual and Impulsive. Energetic particles (electrons and ions) from impulsive SEP events are believed to be accelerated at flare sites during a short period of time and then propagate into the interplanetary medium. The observed time intensity profiles and anisotropies of electrons and ions in impulsive events are the results of combined effects of injection at the Sun and the propagation of energetic particles in the solar wind. To discern the effects of propagation from that of injection, observations at multiple heliocentric distances are crucial. The Sentinels project, including 4 Inner Heliospheric Sentinels spacecraft, will provide valuable dataset of energetic particles at distances from 0.25 AU to 1.0 AU, thus allowing one to better understand the propagation effect and constrain the injection profile. In this work, we investigate how the time-intensity profiles and anisotropies of energetic particles in impulsive events vary as a function of heliocentric distance. We concentrate our study on almost ""scatter-free"" events since the propagation effects in these events are the easiest to deduce. By assuming pitch angle scattering as the main agent of the wave-particle interaction between propagating energetic particles and the solar wind magnetic turbulence, we can relate the width of the observed time intensity profiles to the strength of the turbulence (and thus diffusion coefficient). We note that our simulation (for high energy electrons) can be used to investigate the properties of the magnetic turbulence, as a function of distance, in quiet solar wind. This again, can be compared with Sentinels observations, and will advance our understanding of the quiet solar wind turbulence., Ions accelerated in solar flares interact with the solar atmosphere to produce gamma-ray lines and neutrons. Some of the neutrons that escape from the Sun into interplanetary space can survive to the Earth and be observed both by satellite detectors and by ground-based neutron monitors. Observations of such solar neutrons provide information about the ion acceleration mechanism in solar flares and propagation of the neutrons. Solar neutrons were observed by the Tsumeb neutron monitor on the ground from the solar flare on 2003 October 28. Gamma-ray lines at 2.2, 4.4, and 6.1 MeV were also observed by the INTEGRAL and RHESSI satellites. Using these gamma-ray line emissions, we calculate predicted time-dependent neutron spectra arriving at Earth using the solar flare magnetic loop transport and interaction model of Hua et al. (2002). These spectra are then convolved with the response functions of the Earth's atmosphere and the neutron monitor to provide predicted neutron monitor count rates. We compare these predicted rates with the observed rates and search for the best model to explain data., We present far ultraviolet (FUV:1350 1750Ang) spectral imaging observations recorded with the SPEAR satellite originating in a 60° x 30° rectangular region close to the North Galactic Pole. We have obtained maps of interstellar emission line intensity including the lines of CIV (1550Ang), SiIV (1394Ang) and SiII* (1533Ang), binned to a spatial resolution of 4 sq. deg. on the sky. These data represent the first spectral maps of the of the highly ionized medium (HIM) and the warm ionized medium (WIM) recorded at high galactic latitudes. The data are presented as line intensity ratio maps, e.g. CIV/SiIV and CIV/SiII*, such that the observed spatial variations in these ratios can be associated with the varying physical conditions of interstellar gas at high galactic latitude. <P />The SPEAR (or “FIMS”) is supported by NASA grant NAG5-5355 and flies on the STSAT-1 Mission, supported of the Korea Ministry of Science and Technology., We report measurements of sunspot umbral and penumbral contrast as a function of Magnetic Flux Density (MFD), disk position, and time over Solar Cycle 23 from full-disk magnetogram and continuum images of the SOHO/MDI instrument. Using a technique of image segmentation which utilizes region labeling of entire MDI intensity images in order to segment prospective sunspots and then the application of radial derivatives from the centers of the spots we successfully identify the umbral-penumbral interface of large sunspots in the MDI database. The extracted penumbral and umbral pixels of these images are binned according to MFD and disk position to study the behavior of sunspot contrast. We report measurements of sunspot umbral and penumbral contrast as a function of Magnetic Flux Density (MFD), disk position, and time over Solar Cycle 23 from full- disk magnetogram and continuum images of the SOHO/MDI instrument. This research was partially supported by LWS TR&amp;T Grant NNG05 GK48G., The dayside ionospheric dynamo is driven largely by tidal winds in the E-region. These tides vary significantly during the year, but are highly structured during equinox, with a dominant non-migrating wave-4 signature at low latitudes. These tidal components originate in the troposphere with the release of latent heat and absorption of IR radiation in persistent tropical rainstorms. Recent observations by NASA TIMED and IMAGE satellites have reported the finding of the effects of these tides in the density and morphology of the equatorial ionospheric anomaly (EIA), reasonably attributed to the modulation of the E-region dynamo electric field in daytime by the tidal winds. However, significant day-to-day variability in the zonal wave-4 signature of the brightness and separation of the bands of the EIA is found. Here, we seek to understand this variability, whether it is tied to variations in the strength of the upward-propagating tides, or to some other effect that diminishes and/or overrides the effect of the tides on the EIA development. This study relies on global observations from the TIMED-SABER instrument that measures the temperature variations in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) associated with the upward-propagating tides. F-region density measurements are made concurrent to the MLT temperature retrievals by both the TIMED-GUVI and IMAGE-FUV instruments. This initial study focuses on the March-April period in 2002 and on times of low magnetic activity where penetrating electric fields from high latitudes do not complicate the ionospheric observations., The pitch angle distributions (PADs) of solar impulsive electron events measured at 1 AU provide important information on the solar release of the electrons and their interplanetary transport. Using WIND/3DP electron data, we investigate the energy and time dependence of the PADs for six impulsive electron events with short time durations, low pre-event background, good count statistics and the electron energy range from ~0.5 keV to ~200 keV. The PADs of the pre-event background are anisotropic below ~2 keV due to halo electrons continuously streaming out from the Sun at these energies and isotropic above. In the preliminary study of two events (1998 Aug 29 and 2002 Oct 20), we remove such pre-event background. We find that the PAD width at half maximum is roughly constant from ~0.5 keV to 10-13 keV. It remains below ~30 degrees and changes slightly through the rapid-rise, rapid-decay phase, and it increases up to ~50-60 degrees at the slow-decay phase. We also find that the PAD width above ~13-20 keV increases with both energy and time. At the peak phase the width increases from ~40-50 degrees at 30 keV to ~60-70 degrees at 200 keV. At 200 keV it increases from ~50-60 degrees at the rapid-rise phase to ~80 degrees at the slow-decay phase. These properties suggest that, for these solar impulsive electron events, the low-energy electrons propagate nearly scatter-free in the interplanetary medium, while the high energy electrons experience some energy-dependent scattering. Furthermore, at a fixed energy, after electrons are scattered to different pitch angles, they travel to 1 AU at different speeds parallel to the magnetic field line. We analyze the pitch-angle dispersion and estimate the distance between the scattering site and 1 AU. We find that for high-energy electrons the average is ~0.03±0.06 AU., The significant variability in the measured flux of relativistic (~MeV) electrons in the Earth's outer radiation belt is the result of competing acceleration and loss processes. Several distinct loss processes have been identified which individually can significantly and rapidly (~1 day) deplete the radiation belt. Precipitation of electrons in the atmosphere by resonant wave-particle interactions is one such loss process. Different modes of such atmospheric loss should be distinguishable by their dependence on L-shell and local time. This poster will connect direct observations of loss made by the MINIS balloon campaign during commencement of the January 21, 2005 magnetic storm to observations of the pre- and post-storm fluxes made by several GPS satellites. MINIS observed bremsstrahlung X-rays produced by relativistic electron precipitation from the outer radiation belt. At the time there were two MINIS balloons located in the dusk sector near L=4 where GPS makes an equatorial crossing. We will present results showing the scattering efficiency as a function of energy, relative flux in the local loss cone, and total observed loss rate. We also place limits on the spatial scale of the precipitation by comparing the observed loss rate to the net change in trapped flux., In this study we present new observations of the nonlinear evolution of the upstream edge of the density hole into a shock-like structure. In 2003 the Cluster constellation was largely elongated in the Sun-Earth direction, with the maximum separation of ~1.5 RE. In this configuration the Cluster have observed the temporal evolution of the upstream edge of the density holes as they passed through the constellation. In the early phase of the evolution the solar wind was compressed at the upstream edge and formed a compressional pulse that resembled a solitary wave. In the spacecraft frame the pulse had a right-handed elliptical polarization. In the late phase the upstream edge steepened with the amplitude growing to δB/B0 &gt; ~2, evolving into a shock-like structure. We also observed behind the steepened edge a downstream- like plasma which grew as the density hole evolved. In the late phase when the downstream-like region had largely developed, gyrating components from the shock-like structure were detected and the ion distributions became more isotropic. This observation will exhibit how the shock evolves from the compressional wave and how the ions and magnetic field dynamically interact in the process., Quasi-biennial oscillations have long been recognized independently in solar and climatic parameters. Here we explore a possible connection between similar oscillations in high-latitude surface climate and solar magnetic fields., Determining whether magnetic field reconnection does or does not occur within a current sheet in space is difficult because signatures such as the quadrupolar out-of-plane magnetic field (BY), normal magnetic field (bX), ion jet in the outflow region, etc. may or may not occur in the presence or absence of reconnection. While direct electric and magnetic field measurements offer additional information, the field components that are necessary and sufficient for reconnection, which are a non-zero normal magnetic field (bX) and tangential electric field (eY and/or eZ), are usually small compared to the normal electric field (EX), out-of-plane magnetic field (BY) and reconnection magnetic field (BZ). So they are sometimes difficult to determine because of uncertainties in both the measurements and the required coordinate transformations. From analyses of the correlations between the large and easily measured EX, BY and BZ that are imposed by the condition that the average parallel electric field is zero on the ion scale, a method is developed to determine that bX, eY, and/or eZ are non-zero and to estimate their sizes. Applications of this method to data at the sub-solar magnetopause will be presented., We present a study of the far-IR radio continuum correlation within the Small Magellanic Cloud using MIPS far-infrared maps obtained as part of the Spitzer Survey of the SMC (S3MC) and radio continuum maps from a combined ATCA-Parkes survey. With these high resolution data, we can study the correlation within the SMC down to scales of about 35 parsecs. We find that there is a correlation even on these small linear scales. In general, the slope of the correlation is approximately unity, except in H II regions where we see an excess of radio continuum relative to the far-IR. Using the MCELS H-alpha image we decompose the radio continuum maps into thermal and non-thermal components and show that the excess corresponds to a higher thermal fraction in H II regions. We also find that regions with molecular gas (as determined by CO) have an excess of far-IR emission relative to radio continuum. We examine these behaviors at various resolutions and discuss their origins and relation to the global far-IR radio continuum correlation. <P />This work is based on observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope (NASA-JPL Spitzer grant 1264151 awarded to Cycle 1 project 3316). K. S. is supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship., Detection of life on Mars requires definition of a suitable biomarker and development of sensitive instrumentation capable of performing in situ chemical analyses [1]. Our studies have focused on amino acid analysis because amino acids are more resistant to decomposition than other biomolecules, and because amino acid chirality is a well-defined biomarker. We have developed the Mars Organic Analyzer (MOA), a portable amino acid analysis system that consists of a compact instrument and a novel multi-layer CE microchip, and we have performed extensive laboratory and field validation of this instrument [2]. The heart of the MOA is the 100-mm diameter, 4-mm thick microchip that contains the CE separation channels as well as microfabricated valves and pumps for automated integrated sample preparation and handling. The microfabricated device is operated by a portable instrument that performs CE separation and LIF detection. The limits of detection of fluorescamine-labeled amino acids are in the nM to pM range corresponding to part- per-trillion sensitivities. The MOA has been field tested on soil samples rich in jarosite from the Panoche Valley, CA. These results demonstrate that amines and amino acids can be extracted from sulfate-rich acidic soils such as jarosite and analyzed using the MOA. The MOA was also recently field tested in the Yungay region of the Atacama Desert in Chile. The instrument was successfully operated in this challenging environment and performed over 300 amino acid analyses in a two week period. The MOA has also been used to label and analyze two of the four nucleobases, and methods are being developed to detect PAH's [3]. This presentation will discuss the unique challenges of developing microdevices for sensitive analysis of biomarker compounds. We will also describe current efforts to develop multichannel analysis systems and microfluidic automated analysis systems that will be used to enable flight versions of this instrument. For more details on this work and on the development of the Urey Instrument suite for the ESA Exomars Mission see http://astrobiology.berkeley.edu [1] Bada, J. L. et al., (2005) Astronomy &amp; Geophysics 46, 26-27. [2] Skelley, A. M. et al., (2005) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 104, 1041-1046. [3] Skelley, A. M. et al., Astrobiology, in press., We present near-infrared Keck laser guide star adaptive optics (AO) images of the central starburst region of the Local Group dwarf irregular IC 10. The field is centered on the putative Wolf-Rayet (W-R) object [MAC92] 24. We compare these H and K' band data with an F814W image obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. Because systematic error in AO photometry is potentially large due to uncertainties in the point spread function (PSF), we have used the Fourier power spectrum method of Sheehy, McCrady and Graham (ApJ, 647, 1517) to reduce it to 0.04 mag., or less. The W-R object [MAC92] 24 is resolved into at least six blue stars. Four of these components have near-IR colors and luminosities that make them robust WN star candidates. By comparing the K' versus [F814W]-K' color-magnitude diagram we find that the stellar population is best represented by two distinct periods of star formation, one 10 Myr ago and one significantly older (150-500 Myr). We derived reddening and distance estimates by matching the location of Carbon stars in the IC10 color-magnitude diagram (CMD) with that in the SMC CMD, as well as by locating the tip of the giant branch in the IC10 F814W, H, and K' luminosity functions. We find from the Carbon stars a distance modulus for IC 10 of about 24.5 mag., and from the tip of the giant branch a weighted mean distance modulus of (m-M) = 24.48 +/0.08 with a systematic error of +/0.16 mag due to possible mismatches between the RGB populations of IC 10 and the SMC., A new large-scale longitudinal structure has recently been discovered in the equatorial ionosphere. The peak plasma density and separation of the two bands of the post-sunset equatorial ionospheric anomaly (EIA) observed by the FUV instruments onboard the NASA IMAGE and TIMED satellites were found to vary significantly, with maxima in 4 sectors around the planet during equinox. It has been demonstrated that this wavenumber-4 structure corresponds well with the non-migrating diurnal tide in the lower thermosphere. Modulation of the strength of the E-region dynamo fields and associated equatorial fountain in the F-region ionosphere by these tides has been suggested to be the likely mechanism for creating the observed longitudinal variations in the EIA. Here we present the first attempts to use the NRL SAMI2 model to quantify what change in the dynamo fields as a function of universal time and longitude would be required to reproduce changes in the EIA of the same order as those observed by IMAGE and TIMED., We will revisit and discuss the electron density and temperature derived from the electrostatic noise measurement made with the URAP-RAR dipole electric antenna on Ulysses, as this probe flew by pole-to-pole during the minimum solar activity (1994-95). The electron parameters are obtained by fitting a model of the voltage power spectrum to the voltage measured at the terminals of an electric antenna. This method is generically known as quasi thermal noise spectroscopy. In the present work, the model of spectrum is depending on only 3 parameters and computed by assuming that the electron velocity distribution is a generalized Lorentzian or kappa distribution. The 3 fitted parameters are thus the electron density, temperature and kappa value of the distribution, and we will discuss their variations with heliocentric distance, latitude and temporal solar activity. We will also compare these new results to those obtained by our team from the same data set but assuming instead a classical core + halo distribution for the electron velocity, that is a sum of two Maxwellian distributions. With this latter method, the only temperature that could be determined with enough precision was the core temperature, while our new processing provides the total temperature of the solar wind electrons. We will finally focus on the total temperature gradient with distance we find when using such a kappa distribution., Dendritic valley networks near the landing site of the Huygens probe on Titan imply that fluid has eroded the surface. The fluid was most likely methane, which forms several percent of Titan's atmosphere and can exist as a liquid at the surface. The morphology of the valley networks and the nature of Titan's surface environment are inconsistent with a primary valley formation process involving thermal, chemical, or seepage erosion. The valleys were more likely eroded mechanically by surface runoff associated with methane precipitation. If mechanical erosion did occur, the flows must first have been able to mobilize any sediment accumulated in the valleys. We develop a model that links precipitation, open-channel flow, and sediment transport to calculate the minimum precipitation rate required to mobilize sediment and initiate erosion. Using data from two monitored watersheds in the Alps, we show that the model is able to predict precipitation rates in small drainage basins on Earth. The calculated precipitation rate is most sensitive to the sediment grain size. For a grain diameter of 1--10 cm, a range that brackets the median size observed at the Huygens landing site, the minimum precipitation rate required to mobilize sediment in the nearby branching networks is 0.5-- 15 mm hr-1. We show that this range is reasonable by calculating the column depth of methane that could condense in a convective plume in Titan's troposphere, and comparing this depth with observed lifetimes of tropospheric clouds. We validate our approach by performing the same calculation for tropical convective storms on Earth. The minimum precipitation rates inferred from the dendritic valley networks can be compared with observations of tropospheric cloud activity and theoretical predictions of methane precipitation rates to further test the hypothesis that runoff eroded the valleys., The importance of southward magnetic fields within and around interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) for the geospace responses is well known. For example, southward fields in the shocked sheath region preceding the ICME driver or ejecta can lead to a rapid storm onset following the sudden commencement rather than a delayed onset. These are the simplest fields in the ICME to understand and predict because they are the piled-up fields of the ambient solar wind for which pre-ICME measurements exist and fairly accurate models have been developed. However, the sheath field often fluctuates between Northward and Southward due to the presence in the ecliptic of the heliospheric current sheet, and the sheath is normally of shorter duration than the ejecta that follows. The ~1-2 day long ejecta passage produces the steadier, and often highest magnitude north-south fields in an ICME. These have the potential to produce the greatest magnetospheric effects. We show some results from CISM numerical experiments demonstrating the geospace importance of understanding the source of ejecta southward fields. We also show how solar observations and models are being used to investigate this question. New observations from STEREO, coupled with those from SOHO, Solar-B, ACE and WIND, will give a multipoint perspective on the roles of various coronal field structures, the details of the photospheric field evolution, and the ambient solar wind in the generation of geoeffective ICMEs., Organic molecules observed in proto-planetary discs, such as cyanuric acid (H3C3N3O3), transform through currently unknown processes to the complex prebiotic compounds believed to have led to life on Earth. These processes could occur within the upper layers of the early Earth during the Hadean and Archaean. Laboratory experiments show that pressures of 1-10 GPa and temperatures of 300-600 K facilitate the formation of complex molecules from simple organic precursors. In particular, formic acid, another organic material associated with proto-planetary discs, undergoes irreversible reactions at pressures and temperatures above 2.5 GPa and 430 K with the products characterized by Raman peaks at 1349, 1520 and 1592 cm^{- 1}, close to peaks measured from interplanetary dust particle material. Cyanuric acid is of special interest because it has a structure similar to the carbon-nitrogen rings and helices incorporated in nucleosides and other key biological components. It appears to form N-H\dotsO and C--O\dotsH intramolecular bonds at pressures above 5.0 GPa, and forms complex macromolecular material at temperatures over 400K. If by emerging below the surface of a planet it can be protected from impact (including the late heavy bombardment) and other external threats, life may ultimately be initiated by conformational changes induced in pre-biotic molecules by pressure., Detection of liquid water on Mars is a key exploration objective, but geophysical methods currently in use or under consideration for subsurface exploration (radar and seismic, respectively) are not optimal for water detection. Electromagnetic (EM) sounding is sensitive to water with even modest dissolved solids, and brines are a near-ideal EM target. The magnetotelluric technique is a passive, low-frequency EM sounding method that can be compactly implemented and is capable of the characterization of groundwater from depths ranging from 100 m to 10 km or more on Mars. With support from NASA planetary and Mars instrument programs, we have developed an autonomous magnetotelluric sensor platform and demonstrated it at several field-test sites in Idaho's eastern Snake River Plain, the terrestrial type location for planetary plains-style basaltic volcanism. Soundings up to two kilometers deep detected the contact between aqueously altered tuff and relatively unaltered basalt, a proxy for the water table on Mars. We will discuss passive EM methodologies, our instrument development effort and field-test results, and the use of low-mass, passive instrumentation to enable deep subsurface exploration on future Mars Scout or network missions., STEREO's IMPACT (In-situ Measurements of Particles and CME Transients) investigation provides the first opportunity for long duration, detailed observations of 1 AU magnetic field structures, plasma and suprathermal electrons, and energetic particles at points bracketing Earth's heliospheric location. The PLASTIC instrument takes plasma ion composition measurements completing STEREO's comprehensive in-situ perspective. Stereoscopic/3D information from the STEREO SECCHI imagers and SWAVES radio experiment make it possible to use both multipoint and quadrature studies to connect interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICME) and solar wind structures to CMEs and coronal holes observed at the Sun. The uniqueness of the STEREO mission requires novel data analysis tools and techniques to take advantage of the mission's full scientific potential. An interactive browser with the ability to create publication-quality plots has been developed which integrates STEREO's in-situ data with data from a variety of other missions including WIND and ACE. Also, an application program interface (API) is provided allowing users to create custom software that ties directly into STEREO's data set. The API allows for more advanced forms of data mining than currently available through most web-based data services. A variety of data access techniques and the development of cross-spacecraft data analysis tools allow the larger scientific community to combine STEREO's unique in-situ data with those of other missions, particularly the L1 missions, and, therefore, to maximize STEREO's scientific potential in gaining a greater understanding of the heliosphere., Ions accelerated in solar flares interact with the ambient atmosphere to produce not only the prompt gamma- ray line emission that has been observed in many flares, but also radioactive nuclei with long half-lives. The most notable of these nuclei is Co-56, which has a half-life of 78.8~days and upon decay produces very narrow lines at 847~keV and 1.238~MeV. Due to the long half-life of Co-56, the radioactive material will accumulate over multiple flares and persist over many weeks. The initial fluxes seen in these lines can constrain models of ion acceleration in flares in a similar way to fluxes of the prompt lines. More importantly, their decay profile with time would provide an absolutely new probe -- a radioactive tracer -- of the mixing of material from the chromosphere and upper photosphere to greater depths. The high-resolution spectral capabilities of the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) provide the best opportunity to date for detecting such lines above the background. We present the results from our preliminary search for the lines from these long-lived radioactive nuclei. The work at the University of California, Berkeley, was supported by NASA grant NNG05GI89G., We report the first two-spacecraft (Wind and ACE) detection of oppositely directed plasma jets within a bifurcated current sheet in the solar wind. The event occurred on January 3, 2003 and provides further direct evidence that such jets result from reconnection. The magnetic shear across the bifurcated current sheet at both Wind and ACE was approximately 150 degrees, indicating that the magnetic shear must have been the same at the reconnection site located between the two spacecraft. These observations thus provide strong evidence for component merging with a guide field approximately 30% of the antiparallel field. The dimensionless reconnection rate based on the measured inflow was 0.03, implying fast reconnection., We calculate the thermal and dynamical evolution of the surface layers of an accreting neutron star during the rise of a superburst. For the first few hours following unstable 12C ignition, the nuclear energy release is transported by convection. However, as the base temperature rises, the heating time becomes shorter than the eddy turnover time and convection becomes inefficient. This results in a hydrodynamic nuclear runaway, in which the heating time becomes shorter than the local dynamical time. Such hydrodynamic burning can drive shock waves into the surrounding layers and may be the trigger for the normal X-ray burst found to immediately precede the onset of the superburst in both cases where the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer was observing., Continuing the long tradition of low temperature physics, ultracold quantum gases are used today to study subtle order and emergent phenomena of many-body quantum systems. I will touch of some of these exciting developments, including atom optics and the nascence of quantum atom optics, explorations of novel quantum fluids, and the diversity of ultracold, strongly-correlated atomic systems., Pseudopotential-based quasi-harmonic calculations of the properties of iron at elevated pressures and temperatures reveal that the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phase of iron is stable relative to the body-centered cubic (bcc) structure at conditions of the inner core. Ab-initio quantum mechanical molecular dynamic (MD) simulations using the VASP package (pseudotentials with plane-wave basis) confirm that the bcc structure is energetically unfavorable and mechanically unstable relative to tetragonal strains. Therefore, inner-core properties such as the seismologically observed anisotropy of compressional-wave velocities are most likely attributable to the hcp rather than the bcc phase of iron. We obtain the calculated temperature variation of c/a ratio at Earth core pressure in agreement with previous theoretical studies which show that the c/a ratio increases with increasing temperature. Further ab- initio molecular dynamics studies will investigate the elastic constant tensor of hcp iron, important for understanding the origin of inner core anisotropy. There is also need for high resolution measurements for c/a ratio at high pressures and temperatures to be compared with simulation results., Interplanetary Type II radio burst radiation results from the excitation of plasma waves in the ambient medium by a coronal mass ejection (CME) driven shock, propagating outward from the Sun. However, not all disturbances are able to produce Type II emission. Factors such as the speed of the disturbance and the properties of the medium through which the disturbance propagates are fundamental to produce Type II emission. Shock formation requires that the velocity of the disturbance excedes the local fast magnetosonic speed. Some studies have evaluated the radial behaviour of the fast magnetosonic speed as well as the Alfven speed above active regions. By combining both white light (SOHO/LASCO) and radio (Wind/WAVES) observations, we present preliminary results on the Type II intensity emission as a function of heliospheric position and CME speed. This might reveal the average Alfven speed profile in the inner heliosphere which, in turn, would tell us about the location of the solar wind acceleration. This work is supported by the University of California Institute for Mexico and the United States (UC MEXUS)., I discuss two recently discovered ring nebulae around hot massive stars in our galaxy, where the ring nebulae are nearly identical to that around SN1987A. One is a triple-ring nebula around the luminous blue variable (LBV) candidate HD168625, where an equatorial ring was previously known, but a larger bipolar ringed nebula has now been discovered in Spitzer images. The second object is a previously uncataloged B1.5 supergiant seen projected in the Carina Nebula, which is surrounded by a thin equatorial ring that is identical to SN1987A's. Including the previously known nebula around Sher25 in NGC3603, there are now three examples of circumstellar nebulae in our galaxy that are close analogs of the nebula around SN1987A, and all three of them are around blue supergiants. In the two cases where the stars have been studied in detail (Sher25 and HD168625) it is doubtful that the nebulae were formed through the usual paradigm where a fast wind sweeps up a cool red supergiant wind --instead, they were probably ejected in LBV eruptions. The third object in Carina is a new discovery and needs to be studied further. In any case, these three new ring nebulae and other examples around LBVs hint that blue supergiants can eject bipolar nebulae with equatorial rings, without requiring a previously existing slow disk to constrict the outflow. Their similiarity to SN1987A calls into question ideas about the formation of SN1987A's nebula via a fast/slow interacting wind scenario and its previous red supergiant phase. If SN1987A's nebula was also ejected as a blue supergiant, it may have suffered an episodic mass-loss event analogous to LBV explosions, but at somewhat lower luminosity. This would have important consequences for our understanding of stellar evolution at high masses., We solve the 1D neutrino-heated non-relativistic MHD wind problem for conditions that range from slowly rotating (spin period P &gt; 10 ms) protoneutron stars (PNSs) with surface field strengths typical of radio pulsars (B &lt; 10^13 G), to ""proto-magnetars"" with B 10^14-10^15 G in their hypothesized rapidly rotating initial states (P 1 ms). We use the simulations of Bucciantini et al. (2006) to map our monopole results onto a more physical dipole geometry and to estimate the spindown of PNSs when their winds are relativistic. We then quantify the effects of rotation and magnetic fields on the mass loss, energy loss, and r-process nucleosynthesis in PNS winds. We describe the evolution of PNS winds through the Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling epoch, emphasizing the transition between (1) thermal neutrino-driven, (2) non-relativistic magnetically-dominated, and (3) relativistic magnetically-dominated outflows. We find that proto-magnetars with P 1 ms and B &gt; 10^15 G drive relativistic winds with luminosities, energies, and Lorentz factors (magnetization sigma 1-1000) consistent with those required to produce long duration gamma-ray bursts and hyper-energetic supernovae (SNe). A significant fraction of the rotational energy may be extracted in only a few seconds, sufficiently rapidly to alter the asymptotic energy of the SN remnant, its morphology, and, potentially, its nucleosynthetic yield. Winds from PNSs with more modest rotation periods (2 10 ms) and with magnetar-strength fields produce conditions significantly more favorable for the r-process than winds from slowly rotating PNSs. Lastly, we show that energy and momentum deposition by convectively-excited waves further increase the likelihood of successful r-process in PNS winds., In order to examine the potential of seismology to determine the interior structure and properties of Europa, it is essential to calculate seismic velocities and attenuation for the range of plausible interiors. We calculate a range of models for the physical structure of Europa, as constrained by the satellite's composition, mass, and moment of inertia. We assume a water-ice shell, a pyrolitic or a chondritic mantle, and a core composed of pure iron or iron plus 20 weight percent of sulfur. We consider two extreme mantle thermal states: hot and cold. Given a temperature and composition, we determine density, seismic velocities, and attenuation using thermodynamical models. While anelastic effects will be negligible in a cold mantle and the brittle part of the ice shell, strong dispersion and dissipation are expected in a hot convective mantle and the bulk of the ice shell. There is a strong relationship between different thermal structures and compositions. The ``hot'' mantle may maintain temperatures consistent with a liquid core made of iron plus light elements. For the ``cold scenarios,'' the possibility of a solid iron core cannot be excluded, and it may even be favored. The depths of the ocean and core-mantle boundary are determined with high precision, 10 km and 40 km, respectively, once we assume a composition and thermal structure. Furthermore, the depth of the ocean is relatively insensitive (4 km) to the core composition used., The Mars Organic Analyzer (MOA), a portable microfabricated capillary electrophoresis instrument being developed for planetary exploration, is used to analyze a wide variety of fluorescamine-labeled amine-containing biomarker compounds, including amino acids, mono and diaminoalkanes, amino sugars, nucleobases, and nucleobase degradation products. The nucleobases cytosine and adenine, which contain an exocyclic primary amine, were effectively labeled, separated, and detected at concentrations &lt;500 nM. To test the general applicability of the MOA for biomarker detection, amino acids and mono- and diamines were extracted from bacterial cells using both hydrolysis and sublimation followed by analysis. The extrapolated limit of detection provided by the valine biomarker was ~4 × 10<SUP>3</SUP> cells per sample. Products of an NH<SUB>4</SUB>CN polymerization that simulate a prebiotic synthesis were also successfully isolated via sublimation and analyzed. Adenine and alanine/serine were detected with no additional sample cleanup at 120 +/- 13 µM and 4.1 +/- 1 µM, respectively, corresponding to a reaction yield of 0.04% and 0.0003%, respectively. This study demonstrates that the MOA provides sensitive detection and analysis of low levels of a wide variety of amine-containing organic compounds from both biological and abiotic sources., The properties of carbon at high temperature and pressure are of broad interest in planetary science, due to its abundance in planetary bodies, the use of diamond as tracers of terrestrial impact events, and the unparalleled utility of diamonds as high-pressure anvils in the laboratory. We use powerful (TW = 1000 J/ns) lasers to drive shock waves into single-crystal diamond, simultaneously compressing and heating the material. The optical transparency of diamond makes it ideal for studies of carbon at such extreme conditions. Using a suite of ultrafast (picosecond- to nanosecond-resolution) optical diagnostics, including pyrometry and Raman scattering, we have characterized the equation of state, melting curve, electronic conductivity, index of refraction, and elastic-plastic behavior of single-crystal diamond under shock compression to pressures in excess of 10 Mbar and temperatures of several thousand Kelvin., In the high latitude magnetotail, the solid body of the Moon acts as a particle absorber of interplanetary electrons traveling Earthward creating a lunar shadow in the electron flux. Electrons that are just outside the lunar shadow mirror nearer Earth and return to the vicinity of the Moon deflected by the cross tail convection electric field. By measuring this displacement from lunar orbiting spacecraft, the convection electric field can be determined. The convection electric field is an important parameter for magnetospheric dynamics but is difficult to accurately measure by other means. Pioneering work measuring the convection electric field from lunar orbit done during the Apollo Era will be reviewed. We revisit this problem using data from Lunar Prospector which had better energy, angular, and temporal resolutions. Out initial results show that at times the high latitude convection velocity is stable and on the order of 10 km/s in the equatorward direction corresponding to a dawn-dusk electric field of 0.1 mV/m, close to expectations. At other times no consistent electric field can be determined from the data either due to noise, spatial or temporal variability, or another breakdown in the assumptions that go into this method. We will present more detailed analyses of several events with consistent and non-consistent electric fields. Reasons for discrepant cases will be discussed. Finally, we discuss more ideal detector designs and orbit configurations to address this problem for future lunar missions., Density holes, observed by Cluster and Double Star satellites upstream from Earth's bow shock, show an average fractional density depletions {δ}n/n ~0.68 ±0.14 and are of mean duration ~&amp; 17.9 ±10.4s. Density holes are accompanied by similarly shaped magnetic holes suggesting fields and particles are strongly coupled.The density and electromagnetic fields are amplified at the edges typically by a factor of 2-5. To further characterize these density and magnetic holes, we have used the four Cluster capabilities to study the behavior of currents.Currents are calculated using the curlometer technique, an application of Maxwell's law μ0J=∇×B. Moreover, the waves' direction of propagation is calculated to provide information on wave polarization. These analyses have been applied to several density holes including the April 2nd 2002 hole that has a minimum density of 0.5cm-3, an overshoot density of about 8cm-3 and a magnetic field amplification by ~4 times. The preliminary study of that hole reveals the following characteristics: The currents at the overshoot are amplified by a factor of 4.The current parallel to the magnetic field direction, J\|, is mostly positive signifying that it is pointing towards the earth's bow shock (Bx being negative). We also note that the amplitude of J\| is 3 times larger than that of J\bot. Furthermore, hodogram analysis shows that the magnetic field in the overshoot is right handed. Similar analysis will be made at the bow shock boundary to determine whether the mechanisms underlying shocks are similar to those causing the density holes., By obtaining a data set comparable in size and nature to recent generations of local surveys, the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey has made possible the study of the relationships between galaxy properties and local environment at z 1. I will present results from DEEP2 focusing on the evolution of the color-density relation at intermediate redshift (0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.3); we find strong evidence that the build-up of galaxies on the red sequence occurred preferentially in overdense environments over that period. I will show that massive clusters of galaxies do not drive these results; rather, it is group-like environments which dominate. If time permits, I will discuss the physical mechanisms responsible for the quenching of star formation at z 1, including the role of AGN activity and quasar feedback. Lastly, I will present the discovery of a population of bright, blue galaxies in dense environments seen at z 1 but not locally. These objects are likely to be precursors of some of the massive, red galaxies seen today., Previous studies have documented the potential for using relatively short-period body waves and intermediate-period surface waves to explore the structure and tectonics of Europa. We show that long-period measurements (0.001 to 0.1 Hz) may have large amplitudes of displacement (millimeters to centimeters) and are potentially measurable from orbit without requiring a lander. To accurately model the long-period response of Europa, we use normal modes calculated from physically self-consistent models of Europa's structure developed in part 1 (Cammarano et al., 2007). On the basis of the geometry of observed faults, we estimate that faulting events of magnitude 5 or larger may occur regularly. Synthetic seismograms show that long-period displacement measurements with millimeter accuracy could detect current tectonic activity and determine the thickness of Europa's ice shell, and confirm the presence of a subsurface ocean. Determination of deeper structure with seismic measurements, however, is more challenging in the presence of a global liquid ocean, which acts to decouple deeper seismic energy from the surface., Thin current sheets the size of the order of the ion inertial length exhibiting the signature of local magnetic reconnection are shown to be abundant in an intermittent high-β plasma turbulent environment, in the outer magnetosheath downstream of the Earth's quasi-parallel bow shock. The magnetic field turbulent spectra follow a power law scaling f^{-2.1} for large magnetohydrodynamic scales, but show strong intermittency at the ion larmor and ion inertial scales, suggesting that the observed reconnection occurs due to interaction of short scale coherent structures of opposite magnetic polarity. The discovery of reconnecting current sheets in association with intermittency and coherent structures can have important implications for dissipation in turbulent plasmas., Aurora have been observed at many solar system bodies, and provide a visual reminder of the coupling between flowing plasma, planetary magnetospheres, and atmospheres. While they are commonly associated with planets having global magnetic fields, auroral emission has also been reported at Venus and most recently near strong crustal magnetic fields at Mars. A global-scale magnetic field, then, seems not to be required for auroral emission, and it is an open question whether Earth-like auroral physics operate at Mars or Venus. In this presentation we will first review the observations of localized UV emission at Mars by Mars Express and supporting particle observations by Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Express. We will then discuss and evaluate the possible origins of the emission, including electrons stored in closed crustal magnetic fields, direct impact of the atmosphere by solar wind electrons via magnetic cusps, reimpact of ionospheric photoelectrons from the Martian dayside, and meteor impacts. We will discuss the implications of the discovery of aurora at Mars for plasma acceleration and escape on the night side, and for the creation of localized patches of night side ionosphere. Finally we will highlight outstanding questions and research directions related to Martian aurora for the coming years, including the requirements for observation of aurora at visible wavelengths at Mars., Analysis of magnetic fields on the sun is crucial to understanding the generation of solar active regions, plage, and the supergranular network and their contributions to Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) variation. The Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) instrument on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) satellite has measured full-disk Stokes-V magnetograms along with cotemporal continuum images throughout Solar Cycle 23. These pairs of images can be used to study continuum irradiance changes correlated to magnetogram signal over the entire disk and over most of Cycle 23. However the MDI magnetogram signal must be corrected for line-of-sight angle variations. Typically a 1/mu correction factor (where mu is the cosine of the line-of-sight angle to the surface normal) is applied across the entire disk. However near-limb measurements where mu approaches zero are siginificantly over-corrected by a simple 1/mu factor. We demonstrate a newly developed geometric correction function for MDI magnetograms based on the assumption that the distribution of Magnetic Flux Density (MFD) in the active latitudes should exhibit the same behavior no matter what angle it is viewed from. We examine a series of 106 magnetograms in the time period from 01-January-2001 to 30-April-2001. This method was successful in correcting MDI magnetograms to reasonable MFD in the limbs, with a minimal number of overcorrected points in the extreme limb, an improvement upon the typical approach of 1/mu. The resulting distributions of MFD were more uniform over 50 bins of mu and can be more successfully used to study continuum irradiance variations as a function of MFD across the entire disk. This research was partially supported by LWS TR&amp;T Grant NNG05GK46G., In situ observations of the turbulent solar wind directly measure the power spectra of the magnetic and electric field fluctuations down to scales smaller than the ion gyroradius. The gyrokinetic formalism is a suitable approach to capture the low-frequency, collisionless phenomena thought to be important in the solar wind, including heating through the Landau resonance. We present preliminary, nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations of the turbulent cascade in the solar wind through the scale of the ion gyroradius. We also discuss detailed quantitative comparisons with measured power spectra., Since late 2003, Mars Express (MEX) and Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) have been making complementary in situ measurements (in terms of both instrument and orbit) of the Martian plasma environment. Study of MGS and MEX data in tandem provides an opportunity to mitigate the shortcomings of each dataset and increase our overall understanding of the Martian solar wind interaction and atmospheric escape. Close passes of spacecraft (conjunctions) are one particularly powerful means of increasing the utility of measurements, as evidenced by the Cluster mission at Earth. At Mars, conjunctions might be used to obtain more complete simultaneous and/or co-located plasma measurements, which can be used to study a variety of phenomena, including measurements of auroral-like particle acceleration near crustal fields and the three-dimensional motion and shape of plasma boundaries. We will present an analysis of approximately forty conjunctions (instances with instantaneous spacecraft separation smaller than 400 km) of MEX and MGS identified between January 2004 and February 2006. The closest pass was ~40~km, near the South Pole. Conjunctions occur both at mid-latitudes (when the surface-projected orbit tracks of the two spacecraft nearly overlap), and at the poles. We will present comparisons of MEX Analyzer of Space Plasmas and Energetic Atoms (ASPERA-3) data with MGS Magnetometer and Electron Reflectometer (MAG/ER) data for these events. Our case studies include intercomparison of MEX and MGS electron data, the addition of MGS magnetic field and MEX ion data, and the inclusion of solar wind proxy information to establish context. In addition to these close conjunctions, we will present the preliminary results of a search for times when MEX and MGS pass through the same region of space separated by a delay (for time evolution of plasma populations in certain regions), and times when they occupy the same flux tube (for spatial evolution of particle distributions). Continued study of simultaneous MGS-MEX observations, and of simultaneous Rosetta observations planned for February 2007, will provide leverage needed to better understand the interaction of the solar wind with the Martian atmosphere., Using RHESSI data and its unprecedented spectral and spatial coverage, we have done a statistical survey of the spectral and spatial characteristics of flares displaying two footpoints in hard X-rays (HXR). We have manually selected 53 of RHESSI's best observed flares, where both HXR footpoints could be imaged above 50 keV. Numerous correlations could thus be investigated, providing additional constraints to coronal particle acceleration models. Assuming both footpoints are fed by the same electron injections, we will in particular address the question as to whether differences in HXR footpoint spectral indices and flux ratios can be attributed to a difference in column density between the acceleration site and both chromospheric footpoints., A key prediction of theories explaining collisionless magnetic reconnection in magnetotail-like geometries is the formation of Hall magnetic and electric field structure in the vicinity of the diffusion region. Here we present multi-point in-situ observations of a diffusion region observed in the Earth's magnetotail plasma sheet by Cluster and investigate both the electric and magnetic field structure. Observations made by spacecraft above the current sheet are compared with simultaneous observations made by another spacecraft below the current sheet, thus allowing the spatial structure of the Hall electric and magnetic field to be probed directly. It is found that close to the diffusion region, the Hall magnetic field displays the expected symmetric quadrupolar structure. For the first time, the symmetry and structure of the Hall electric field is observed directly; although symmetric about the current sheet, it is much larger on the Earthward side of the diffusion region. In conjunction with the diffusion region, a small scale magnetic flux rope was observed. This flux rope, observed so close to the reconnection site may correspond to what are called secondary islands in computer simulations. Such islands are thought to play an important role in particle acceleration. The core magnetic field is enhanced by a factor of three and observations of the electric field inside the magnetic island show extremely strong electric fields which are likely to play a significant role in the electron dynamics during reconnection., We have studied the OH masers in the star-forming region W3(OH), with data obtained from the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). The data provide an angular resolution of ~5 mas and a velocity resolution of 106 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>. A novel analytical procedure allows us to differentiate between broadband temporal intensity fluctuations introduced by instrumental gain variations plus interstellar diffractive scintillation and intrinsic narrowband variations. Drawn from this 12.5 hr observation, our data are sensitive to variations with timescales of minutes to hours. We find statistically significant intrinsic variations with timescales of ~15-20 minutes or slower, based on the velocity-resolved fluctuation spectra. These variations are seen predominantly toward the line shoulders. The peak of the line profiles shows little variation, suggesting that they perhaps exhibit saturated emission. The associated modulation index of the observed fluctuation varies from statistically insignificant values at the line center to about unity away from the line center. Based on light-travel-time considerations, the 20 minute timescale of intrinsic fluctuations translates to a spatial dimension of ~2-3 AU along the sight lines. On the other hand, the transverse dimension of the sources, estimated from their observed angular sizes of about ~3 mas, is about 6 AU. We argue that these source sizes are intrinsic and are not affected by interstellar scatter broadening. The implied peak brightness temperature of the 1612/1720 maser sources is about ~2×10<SUP>13</SUP> K and a factor of about 5 higher for the 1665 line., The science requirements of next-generation radio telescope arrays present a new set of challenges to traditional imaging and data processing techniques. Instruments such as the MWA and SKA implementing large numbers of small diameter (LNSD) elements have a naturally large field-of-view. In order to achieve high image fidelity and dynamic range, signal contributions from off-center sources must be reduced a task traditionally requiring imaging of the full field-of-view. However, implementing this process under proposed designs requires unreasonable computational speeds while also generating unmanageable volumes of data. One approach to this problem involves dynamic control over the field-of-view, implemented in software as a weighting algorithm within the integration routine of an advanced correlator. Using this technique we can effectively reduce the contribution from sources outside the region of interest, and in some cases dramatically reduce the volume of data exiting the correlator. Herein we focus on verifying the effectiveness of this technique, implemented through the MIT Array Performance Simulator (MAPS). The limitations and design requirements of this approach are also evaluated, including the impact of variable levels of radio frequency interference (RFI) excision on image fidelity and off-center source signal rejection., The backscattered reflectivity of Jupiter's ring has been previously measured over distinct visible and near infrared wavelength bands by a number of ground-based and spaceborne instruments. We present spectra of Jupiter's main ring from 2.21-2.46 μm taken with the NIRSPEC spectrometer at the W.M. Keck observatory. At these wavelengths, scattered light from Jupiter is minimal due to the strong absorption of methane in the planet's atmosphere. We find an overall flat spectral slope over this wavelength interval, except for a possible red slope shortward of 2.25 μm. We extended the spectral coverage of the ring to shorter wavelengths by adding a narrow-band image at 1.64 μm, and show results from 2.27-μm images over phase angles of 1.2°-11.0°. Our images at 1.64 and 2.27 μm reveal that the halo contribution is stronger at the shorter wavelength, possibly due to the redder spectrum of the ring parent bodies as compared with the halo dust component. We find no variation in main ring reflectivity over the 1.2°-11.0° phase angle range at 2.27 μm. We use adaptive optics imaging at the longer wavelength L' band (3.4-4.1 μm) to determine a 2- σ upper limit of 22 m of vertically-integrated I/F. Our observing campaign also produced an L' image of Callisto, showing a darker leading hemisphere, and a spectrum of Amalthea over the 2.2-2.5 and 2.85-3.03 μm ranges, showing deep 3-μm absorption., We selected 1449 galaxies brighter than 11.25 magnitudes from the 2MASS redshift survey which match with galaxies which are also detections in the SDSS DR5 survey. We computed NIR/Optical colors and correlate them with galaxy type. As expected, there is variation of average NIR or optical color with galaxy type: later type spirals are bluer. A subset of 461 of these galaxies also have 21 cm line data available in the literature: for these, NIR/Optical color was correlated with HI content. Also as expected, HI content correlates with galaxy type such that later type spirals have greater HI/L. Since a galaxy's 2 micron luminosity is very well correlated with its baryonic mass in stars this confirms the higher efficiency of star formation in early type spirals. A sample of 2MASS galaxies with no prior HI detections has been observed at the Green Bank Radio Telescope. For this sample, it is shown that optical and IR properties do not conclusively correlate with HI detectability: there is no statistical difference between HI detections and non-detections with any other galaxy property we measured. <P />This work was supported by NSF grant AST0406906 and made use of the GBT, operated by AUI for the NSF., We examine the inner structure of the polar ring galaxies UGC 7576, NGC 2685, and NGC 3718 in U, B, V, and R with images from the WIYN 3.5 meter telescope. Residual images reveal the presence of a luminous, warped disk-like structure in the central host of UGC 7576 and NGC 2685, which is consistent with an S0 morphology. Color maps indicate a B-R color difference in UGC 7576 and a U-B color difference in NGC 2685 between the central host and the polar ring. This provides an indication of a difference in age of stellar populations in the two components of these polar ring galaxies. Star formation can be traced across much of NGC 3718 from the presence of blue clumps and clusters of younger stars. We discuss the implications of these results and their role in shaping future studies of polar-ring galaxies using high resolution optical images from HST and infrared observations. This work was supported by the National Science Foundation's REU program and the Department of Defense's ASSURE program through NSF Award AST-0453442., We present results of a numerical experiment which tests the Aly-Sturrock limit in a fully 3-dimensional, spherical geometry. We compare two common magnetic configurations corresponding to bipolar and multipolar ""active region"" arcades with identical photospheric normal field distributions and applied shearing flows. The bipolar response is a smooth expansion of the stressed fields, void of any explosive behavior, whereas the multipolar configuration results in the rapid expulsion of the low-lying sheared field via the magnetic breakout mechanism for CME initiation. The critical nature of the oppositely-directed overlying field and its topological consequences is discussed in the context of the breakout model., The measured luminosity distances of hydrogen-deficient Type Ia (white-dwarf) supernovae as a function of redshift (z) have shown that the expansion of the Universe is currently accelerating, probably due to the presence of ""dark energy"" (X) having a negative pressure, such as Einstein's infamous cosmological constant (Λ). Combining all of the data with existing results from large-scale structure surveys, we find a best fit for Ω<SUB>M</SUB> and Ω<SUB>X</SUB> of 0.28 and 0.72 (respectively), in excellent agreement with the values derived independently from WMAP measurements of the characteristic angular scale of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation. A number of possible systematic effects (e.g., dust, supernova evolution) thus far do not seem to eliminate the need for Ω<SUB>X</SUB> &gt; 0. Recently, analyses of supernovae at z = 1.0-1.7 reveal an early epoch of deceleration ending at z ≈ 0.5, followed by acceleration as dark energy began to dominate over dark matter. Several research groups are now in the process of measuring hundreds of Type Ia supernovae in the range z = 0.2-0.8 to determine the equation-of-state parameter of the dark energy, w<SUB>X</SUB> = P/(ρc<SUP>2</SUP>), where P is the pressure and ρ is the energy density. Thus far, the best-fit value is w<SUB>X</SUB> = -1, and dw/dz is consistent with 0, suggesting that the dark energy may indeed be the cosmological constant Λ or something quite similar. The true nature of the dark energy is one of the major unsolved problems in fundamental physics, with far-reaching implications beyond the standard model., The upstream density holes described in the previous paper by Parks et al. are non-linear structures observed in the ion foreshock. From multi-spacecraft timing analysis we know that these structures can stand relative to the solar wind, in which cases their formation and time development requires an interaction with the solar wind, as well as with particles emerging from the bow shock downstream. Our approach to understanding the factors leading to their development begins with a detailed examination of ion kinetics placed in context with solar wind conditions, bow shock geometry and local structure geometry. Ion distributions within density holes show an isotropic energetic population that appears much like the diffuse ions seen in quasi-parallel foreshock regions, indicating flux tubes or limited domains in which rapid diffusive heating occurs. The very low densities observed neccesitate a depletion of the main solar wind beam, and this results from an inbalance of inflow and outflow, and possibly due to flow around the structures. Remote sensing distributions confirm the very sharp ion-scale gradients inferred from timing analysis. We present indications that these structures are usually seen in close proximity to the shock, which may point to a direct role of that structure in their occurrence. Finally, we will compare the ion dynamics of foreshock density holes with those occuring in association with other upstream structures, including SLAMS, diamagnetic cavities and hot flow anomolies., Combining both the Northern Sky Variability Survey (NSVS) and the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) has allowed us to search for rare types of eclipsing variable stars based upon their light curves and V, J, H and K colors. We have found ten previously unknown cool Algols and 52 new giant star (GS) eclipsing binary systems. In addition, we have found eight possible subdwarf B star (sdB) eclipsing binaries. Six are systems with periods longer than one day and contain a companion star of M2 or later. The two others have short periods and contain an earlier main sequence companion. <P />This research was funded by a partnership between the National Science Foundation (NSF AST-0552798) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) and the Department of Defense (DoD) ASSURE (Awards to Stimulate and Support Undergraduate Research Experiences) programs., As NASA returns to the Moon, we will need to gain a deeper understanding of the lunar environment and its dependence on heliospheric and magnetospheric conditions. The Lunar Explorer for Elements and Hazards (LEEAH) is a mission that can be rapidly developed to address several high priority measurements relevant to both science and exploration objectives on the Moon. The plasma and particle instrument suite will remotely measure the lunar surface potential and correlate these results with local plasma conditions and solar illumination. LEEAH will also detect lofted dust particles, and thus establish the importance of solar and plasma conditions in the transport and motion of dust in the lunar environment. LEEAH will study the interaction of the solar wind with the lunar surface using a sensitive ion mass spectrometer, and trace the source of sputtered elements in order to derive elemental composition maps with ~20 km spatial resolution. Several instruments will characterize radiation, measuring energetic particles arising from solar storms and the direct biological impact of these events. All of these objectives accomplish intrinsic lunar science goals while simultaneously addressing safety and engineering issues faced by future human missions. LEEAH is low-cost and low-risk, using high heritage instruments, a recently qualified bus design and a team already in place from NASA's THEMIS/MIDEX mission to be launched later this year. As a finalist in the secondary payload opportunity for the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), LEEAH can be implemented rapidly in the near future, leveraging previous phase-A support to reach launch readiness in ~2.5 years., Through the rapid acceleration of a boundary, or supersonic injection, it is possible to generate a shock wave within a plasma. It was the intention of this work to simulate shocks in both a fluid and a kinetic model of a plasma. The particular codes used were Graale, in the fluid case, and CELESTE3D for the kinetic case. It was necessary to verify the validity of the codes first. This was achieved by setting the B-field of Graale to zero, and consequently reducing this plasma code into a gas dynamic code. From here the code was compared against Rankine-Hugonoit jump conditions, and it was found that there was agreement to within 3.6%. Once the fluid case was confirmed accurate, the kinetic case was compared with the fluid case, by comparing the point at which the shocks initially collide. So long as the fluid and kinetic model shocks collide at the same point in time and space, then the shocks speeds are identical and one can presume that the kinetic code is accurate. A noteworthy finding, was the kinetic simulation showed a bifurcated current profile, where as the fluid case did not., Alhough the Moon is typically thought of as having a relatively dormant environment, it is in fact very electrically active. The lunar surface, not protected by any substantial atmosphere, is directly exposed to solar UV and X-rays as well as solar wind plasma and energetic particles. This creates a complex electrodynamic environment, with the surface typically charging positive in sunlight and negative in shadow, and surface potentials varying over orders of magnitude in response to changing solar illumination and plasma conditions. Observations from the Apollo era and theoretical considerations strongly suggest that surface charging also drives dust electrification and horizontal and vertical dust transport. We present a survey of the lunar electric field environment, utilizing both newly interpreted Lunar Prospector (LP) orbital observations and older Apollo surface observations, and comparing to theoretical predictions. We focus in particular on time periods when the most significant surface charging was observed by LP - namely plasmasheet crossings (when the Moon is in the Earth's magnetosphere) and space weather events. During these time periods, kV-scale potentials are observed, and enhanced surface electric fields can be expected to drive significant horizontal and vertical dust transport. Both dust and electric fields can have serious effects on habitability and operation of machinery, so understanding the coupled dust-plasma-electric field system around the Moon is critically important for planning exploration efforts, in situ resource utilization, and scientific observations on the lunar surface. Furthermore, from a pure science perspective, this represents an excellent opportunity to study fundamental surface-plasma interactions., The Cassini Ion and Neutral Camera (INCA) provided images of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) that are created when energetic (10-200 keV) ions in Saturn's magnetosphere interact with Titan's neutral exosphere. These images show an asymmetric halo of ENA emission about Titan that fades at larger distances. Large variations in ENA brightness reflect both temporal variability in the local magnetospheric ion population and also possibly related variations in the exospheric density. An advantage of ENA imaging is that it can remotely monitor the ion energy input into Titan's atmosphere and the exospheric response together. The challenge is to sort out the relative effects. The INMS investigation on Cassini has detected modest variability and asymmetries in the exosphere with in-situ measurements, but the flybys have been too few to detect the extremes of exospheric variations and the global behavior. We use a model for the Titan ENA images based on Monte Carlo test-particle simulations that utilize the electric and magnetic fields from a 3-d MHD simulation of Titan's magnetospheric interaction with various models of the exosphere to study the differences between the magnetospheric ion and exospheric density distribution effects on the ENA images. We suggest how the ENA images may be used to provide remote sensing of Titan's exosphere when the spacecraft is not flying through it, and the implications of the very bright and extended ENA images., The distance measurements that have been used in determining the acceleration of the universe are based on type Ia supernova (SN Ia) luminosities calibrated using the light-curve shape. Detailed analysis of SNe Ia, and peculiar objects in particular, lead to a better understanding of the physics associated with the luminosity calibration, hopefully leading to more precise distances. SN 1999aa (and similar objects) is a somewhat peculiar SN Ia with spectral properties intermediate to a normal SN Ia and the prototypical overluminous SN 1991T. Similarly, SN 1999aa's light curves appear to bridge the gap between the normal and overluminous SNe Ia. The incredible homogeneity of SNe Ia (including overluminous objects) suggests that all SNe Ia come from a similar progenitor and have a similar explosion model. Since SN 1999aa has characteristics in common with both normal and overluminous objects, understanding the physics of SN 1999aa-like events may help constrain progenitor and explosion models for both types of objects. We present optical spectra and photometry across four bandpasses for a set of SN 1999aa-like objects. This data suggests that SN 1999aa is the Rosetta stone in understanding the differences and similarities between normal and overluminous SNe Ia., We have documented a two-fold increase in the viscosity of water from 0.1 MPa (1 bar) to 1 GPa at room temperature and a 1.3-fold increase at 1.5 GPa and 70 degrees Celcius using an externally-heated, rolling sphere diamond-cell viscometer. Given the importance of water in planetary geophysics, it is surprising that almost no measurements of viscosity are available above 1 GPa. This is at least in part due to the difficulty in reliably measuring the rapid fall times of spheres used to determine viscosities in fluids. This problem has been eliminated by using a strobed light-emitting diode, allowing us to calibrate to ambient-condition viscosities and obtain high pressure viscosities consistent with accurate values given in the literature for water. In principle, our approach can be extended to over 30 GPa and 1000 K, thereby providing significant tests of theoretical models of fluid transport properties at conditions existing deep inside planets., The Southern Galactic Plane Survey (SGPS) is a radio survey in the 21 cm H I line and in 1.4 GHz full-polarization continuum, observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array and the Parkes 64 m single-dish telescope. The survey spans a Galactic longitude of 253<SUP>deg</SUP>&lt;l&lt;358<SUP>deg</SUP> and a latitude of |b|&lt;1.5d at a resolution of 100"" and a sensitivity below 1 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP>. This paper presents interferometer only polarized continuum survey data and describes the data taking, analysis processes, and data products. The primary data products are the four Stokes parameters I, Q, U, and V in 25 overlapping fields of 5.5d by 3°, from which polarized intensity, polarization angle, and rotation measure are calculated. We describe the effects of missing short spacings, and discuss the importance of the polarized continuum data in the SGPS for studies of fluctuations and turbulence in the ionized interstellar medium and for studying the strength and structure of the Galactic magnetic field., Observations of oxygen pickup ions by the plasma analyzer on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO) Mission arguably launched broad interest in solar wind erosion of unmagnetized planet atmospheres, and its potential evolutionary effects. Oxygen pickup ions may play key roles in the removal of the oxygen excess left behind from the photodissociation of water vapor by enabling direct escape, additional sputtering of oxygen when they impact the exobase, and escape as energetic neutrals produced in charge exchange reactions with the ambient exospheric oxygen and hydrogen. Although the PVO observations were compromised by an ∼8 keV energy limit for O <SUP>+</SUP> detection, a lack of ion composition capability, and the limited sampling and data rate of the plasma analyzer which was designed for solar wind monitoring, these measurements provide our best information about the extended O <SUP>+</SUP> exosphere and wake at Venus. Here we show the full picture of the spatial distribution and energies of the O <SUP>+</SUP> ion observations collected by the plasma analyzer during PVO's ∼5000 orbit tour. A model of O <SUP>+</SUP> test particles launched in the circum-Venus fields described by an MHD simulation of the solar wind interaction is used to help interpret the PVO observations and to anticipate the expanded view of Venus O <SUP>+</SUP> escape that will be provided by the ASPERA-4 experiment on Venus Express., We present Lunar Prospector Magnetometer (LP MAG) observations of monochromatic circularly polarized low frequency waves at frequencies of 0.4-4 Hz near the Moon. We observe such waves on about 6.6% of LP orbits in the solar wind, outside of the lunar wake. About a third of them occur on orbits when we also observe external magnetic enhancements (``limb shocks''), and most are clearly associated with lunar crustal magnetic sources, indicating an origin related to solar wind interaction with lunar magnetic fields. The inferred propagation vectors and polarizations of these waves are consistent with the expected characteristics of whistler-mode waves. These observations could indicate either upstream whistler waves produced at shock surfaces above lunar crustal magnetic sources, or phase-standing whistler wakes formed by direct solar wind interaction with lunar crustal magnetic fields., AMANDA at the South Pole has been the world's largest high-energy neutrino telescope. It is now an integral part of the IceCube neutrino observatory presently under construction at the same location. A summary of the recent results from AMANDA is presented and a report on the first two construction seasons of the IceCube telescope is given., Supernova experiments to characterize dark energy require a well designed low redshift program; we consider this for both ongoing/near term (e.g. Supernova Legacy Survey) and comprehensive future (e.g. SNAP) experiments. The derived criteria are: a supernova sample centered near z≈0.05 comprising 150 500 (in the former case) and 300 900 (in the latter case) well measured supernovae. Low redshift Type Ia supernovae play two important roles for cosmological use of the supernova distance-redshift relation: as an anchor for the Hubble diagram and as an indicator of possible systematics. An innate degeneracy in cosmological distances implies that 300 nearby supernovae nearly saturate their cosmological leverage for the first use, and their optimum central redshift is z≈0.05. This conclusion is strengthened upon including velocity flow and magnitude offset systematics. Limiting cosmological parameter bias due to supernova population drift (evolution) systematics plausibly increases the requirement for the second use to less than about 900 supernovae., Motivated by the lessons of black hole complementarity, we develop a causal patch description of eternal inflation. We argue that an observer cannot ascribe a semiclassical geometry to regions outside his horizon, because the large-scale metric is governed by the fluctuations of quantum fields. In order to identify what is within the horizon, it is necessary to understand the late time asymptotics. Any given worldline will eventually exit from eternal inflation into a terminal vacuum. If the cosmological constant is negative, the universe crunches. If it is zero, then we find that the observer’s fate depends on the mechanism of eternal inflation. Worldlines emerging from an eternal inflation phase driven by thermal fluctuations end in a singularity. By contrast, if eternal inflation ends by bubble nucleation, the observer can emerge into an asymptotic, locally flat region. As evidence that bubble collisions preserve this property, we present an exact solution describing the collision of two bubbles., Polarization electric fields created by the E- and F-region dynamos cause the uplift of F-region plasma. The subsequent redistribution of that plasma along the magnetic field lines creates the equatorial ionospheric anomaly (EIA). Observations of the post-sunset EIA made by the IMAGE and TIMED satellites are compared here with CHAMP, Ørsted and SAC-C observations of the noontime equatorial electrojet (EEJ). During magnetically quiet periods around equinox, the EIA and EEJ show a remarkably similar four-peaked wave-like longitudinal variation. Its structure is consistent with the longitudinal variation in the strength of diurnal tides that drive the E-region dynamo. This indicates a strong vertical coupling between the ionosphere and troposphere because the four-peaked tidal structure is driven by tropospheric weather. Furthermore, the dayside ionospheric conditions are found to perform the global-scale longitudinal structure of the post-sunset ionosphere at low latitudes., We investigate the effect of shear in the flow of charged particle equilibria that are unstable to the coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) instability. Shear may act to quench this instability because it acts to limit the size of the region with a fixed phase relation between emitters. The results are important for the understanding of astrophysical sources of coherent radiation where shear in the flow is likely., Interferometric observations of six Mira-type stars: R Aqr, CIT 3, χ Cyg, W Aql, R Leo, and U Ori are reported. All measurements were made by UC Berkeley's Infrared Spatial Interferometer (ISI), which is comprised of three 1.65 m telescopes using a heterodyne detection system currently operating at 11.15 μm. All data were taken in a nonredundant east-west linear configuration of telescopes, at a variety of spatial frequencies, with baselines of up to 12 m. By fitting a smooth curve to the closure phase data, as a function of the shortest baseline, the phases of individual visibility measurements can be determined. With curves of the visibility and phase, one-dimensional images are then constructed by an inverse Fourier transform. These images show significant changes in the stars and surrounding dust between the years 2003 and 2004 indicating nonconstant gas emission. They also show significant and varied types of asymmetry, including asymmetries that may be caused by companions, asymmetric stars, or asymmetric dust emission., Branching valley networks near the landing site of the Huygens probe on Titan imply that fluid has eroded the surface. The fluid was most likely methane, which forms several percent of Titan's atmosphere and can exist as a liquid at the surface. The morphology of the valley networks and the nature of Titan's surface environment are inconsistent with a primary valley formation process involving thermal, chemical, or seepage erosion. The valleys were more likely eroded mechanically by surface runoff associated with methane precipitation. If mechanical erosion did occur, the flows must first have been able to mobilize any sediment accumulated in the valleys. We develop a model that links precipitation, open-channel flow, and sediment transport to calculate the minimum precipitation rate required to mobilize sediment and initiate erosion. Using data from two monitored watersheds in the Alps, we show that the model is able to predict precipitation rates in small drainage basins on Earth. The calculated precipitation rate is most sensitive to the sediment grain size. For a grain diameter of 1-10 cm, a range that brackets the median size observed at the Huygens landing site, the minimum precipitation rate required to mobilize sediment in the nearby branching networks is 0.5-15 mm hr<SUP>-1</SUP>. We show that this range is reasonable given the abundance of methane in Titan's atmosphere. These minimum precipitation rates can be compared with observations of tropospheric cloud activity and estimates of long-term methane precipitation rates to further test the hypothesis that runoff eroded the valleys., A residual planetesimal disk of mass 10-100 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> remained in the outer solar system following the birth of the giant planets, as implied by the existence of the Oort cloud, coagulation requirements for Pluto, and inefficiencies in planet formation. Upon gravitationally scattering planetesimal debris, planets migrate. Orbital migration can lead to resonance capture, as evidenced here in the Kuiper and asteroid belts, and abroad in extrasolar systems. Finite sizes of planetesimals render migration stochastic (``noisy''). At fixed disk mass, larger (fewer) planetesimals generate more noise. Extreme noise defeats resonance capture. We employ order-of-magnitude physics to construct an analytic theory for how a planet's orbital semimajor axis fluctuates in response to random planetesimal scatterings. The degree of stochasticity depends not only on the sizes of planetesimals, but also on their orbital elements. We identify the conditions under which the planet's migration is maximally noisy. To retain a body in resonance, the planet's semimajor axis must not random walk a distance greater than the resonant libration width. We translate this criterion into an analytic formula for the retention efficiency of the resonance as a function of system parameters, including planetesimal size. We verify our results with tailored numerical simulations. Application of our theory reveals that capture of resonant Kuiper Belt objects by a migrating Neptune remains effective if the bulk of the primordial disk was locked in bodies having sizes &lt;&lt; O(100) km and if the fraction of disk mass in objects with sizes &gt;~1000 km was less than a few percent. Coagulation simulations produce a size distribution of primordial planetesimals, which easily satisfies these constraints. We conclude that stochasticity did not interfere with nor modify in any substantive way Neptune's ability to capture and retain resonant Kuiper Belt objects during its migration., Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is encountered in a wide variety of astrophysical plasmas, including accretion disks, the solar wind, and the interstellar and intracluster medium. On small scales, this turbulence is often expected to consist of highly anisotropic fluctuations with frequencies small compared to the ion cyclotron frequency. For a number of applications, the small scales are also collisionless, so a kinetic treatment of the turbulence is necessary. We show that this anisotropic turbulence is well described by a low-frequency expansion of the kinetic theory called gyrokinetics. This paper is the first in a series to examine turbulent astrophysical plasmas in the gyrokinetic limit. We derive and explain the nonlinear gyrokinetic equations and explore the linear properties of gyrokinetics as a prelude to nonlinear simulations. The linear dispersion relation for gyrokinetics is obtained, and its solutions are compared to those of hot-plasma kinetic theory. These results are used to validate the performance of the gyrokinetic simulation code GS2 in the parameter regimes relevant for astrophysical plasmas. New results on global energy conservation in gyrokinetics are also derived. We briefly outline several of the problems to be addressed by future nonlinear simulations, including particle heating by turbulence in hot accretion flows and in the solar wind, the magnetic and electric field power spectra in the solar wind, and the origin of small-scale density fluctuations in the interstellar medium., The soils of the Atacama Desert in northern Chile have long been known to contain large quantities of unusual salts, yet the processes that form these soils are not yet fully understood. We examined the morphology and geochemistry of soils on post-Miocene fans and stream terraces along a south-to-north (27° to 24° S) rainfall transect that spans the arid to hyperarid transition (21 to ∼2 mm rain y <SUP>-1</SUP>). Landform ages are ⩾ 2 My based on cosmogenic radionuclide concentrations in surface boulders, and Ar isotopes in interbedded volcanic ash deposits near the driest site indicate a maximum age of 2.1 My. A chemical mass balance analysis that explicitly accounts for atmospheric additions was used to quantify net changes in mass and volume as a function of rainfall. In the arid (21 mm rain y <SUP>-1</SUP>) soil, total mass loss to weathering of silicate alluvium and dust (-1030 kg m <SUP>-2</SUP>) is offset by net addition of salts (+170 kg m <SUP>-2</SUP>). The most hyperarid soil has accumulated 830 kg m <SUP>-2</SUP> of atmospheric salts (including 260 kg sulfate m <SUP>-2</SUP> and 90 kg chloride m <SUP>-2</SUP>), resulting in unusually high volumetric expansion (120%) for a soil of this age. The composition of both airborne particles and atmospheric deposition in passive traps indicates that the geochemistry of the driest soil reflects accumulated atmospheric influxes coupled with limited in-soil chemical transformation and loss. Long-term rates of atmospheric solute addition were derived from the ion inventories in the driest soil, divided by the landform age, and compared to measured contemporary rates. With decreasing rainfall, the soil salt inventories increase, and the retained salts are both more soluble and present at shallower depths. All soils generally exhibit vertical variation in their chemistry, suggesting slow and stochastic downward water movement, and greater climate variability over the past 2 My than is reflected in recent (∼100 y) rainfall averages. The geochemistry of these soils shows that the transition from arid to hyperarid rainfall levels marks a fundamental geochemical threshold: in wetter soils, the rate and character of chemical weathering results in net mass loss and associated volumetric collapse after 10 <SUP>5</SUP> to 10 <SUP>6</SUP> years, while continuous accumulation of atmospheric solutes in hyperarid soils over similar timescales results in dramatic volumetric expansion. The specific geochemistry of hyperarid soils is a function of atmospheric sources, and is expected to vary accordingly at other hyperarid sites. This work identifies key processes in hyperarid soil formation that are likely to be independent of location, and suggests that analogous processes may occur on Mars., We report the first two-spacecraft (Wind and ACE) detection of oppositely directed plasma jets within a bifurcated current sheet in the solar wind. The event occurred on January 3, 2003 and provides further direct evidence that such jets result from reconnection. The magnetic shear across the bifurcated current sheet at both Wind and ACE was ~150°, indicating that the magnetic shear must have been the same at the reconnection site located between the two spacecraft. These observations thus provide strong evidence for component merging with a guide field ~ 30% of the antiparallel field. The dimensionless reconnection rate based on the measured inflow was 0.03, implying fast reconnection., A new telescope for Medium Energy Gamma-Ray Astronomy, MEGA, is being developed for the energy band 0.4-50 MeV as a successor to COMPTEL and EGRET. MEGA records gamma rays by detecting and tracking Compton as well as pair creation events in a stack of double-sided Si-strip detectors and stopping them in a surrounding pixelated CsI calorimeter. Its goal is to improve sensitivity by at least an order of magnitude over that of COMPTEL. <P />The extensive simulation tools compiled for the ACT Vision Mission Concept Study are applied to estimate the performance of a potential MEGA space mission. The tools allow the detailed simulation of the different background components expected for the satellite's desired low-earth orbit. We present the expected narrow-line sensitivities of a MIDEX-sized telescope and show that a sensitivity 10 times better than that of COMPTEL is achievable., The Advanced Compton Telescope (ACT) has been selected by NASA for a one-year ""vision mission"" study. The study's main goal is to determine feasible instrument configurations to achieve ACT's sensitivity requirements, and to give recommendations for technology development. Space-based instruments operating in the energy range of nuclear lines are subject to complex backgrounds generated by cosmic rays, earth albedo radiations, trapped particles, and diffuse gamma rays; typically measurements are significantly background-dominated. Therefore accurate, detailed simulations of the background induced in different ACT configurations, and exploration of event selection and reconstruction techniques for reducing these backgrounds, are crucial to determining the capabilities of a given instrument configuration. The ACT simulation team has assembled a complete suite of tools that allows the generation of particle backgrounds for a given orbit, their propagation through any instrument and spacecraft geometry - including delayed photon emission from instrument activation - as well as the selection and reconstruction of Compton events in the given detectors. We describe here the scope of the ACT simulation effort and the suite of tools used., Floodwaters on Mars likely originated from aquifers confined below a cryosphere. We use an analytical solution to examine freezing-induced pressurization as a mechanism for releasing groundwater. The results suggest that freezing of an aquifer of global extent under the optimal conditions, i.e., perfectly confined and with low compressibility and high permeability relative to the terrestrial analogs, can release enough floodwaters to carve an individual outflow channel, but not to explain the large total flood volume required to form the all of the outflow channels. It can also produce discharges comparable to those required for carving the outflow channels by repeated floods., We review recent results on solar energetic electrons observed in situ near 1 AU, and on the radio and X-ray emission generated by these electrons. Near solar maximum, hundreds of solar impulsive electron events are detected per year by the Wind spacecraft. About ~10% are prompt events, where the electrons at all energies are injected from the Sun at the time of the solar type III radio burst, but in the rest the injection of tens of keV electrons is delayed by ~10 minutes. For prompt events with associated flare hard X-ray (HXR) emission, the electron spectrum measured at 1 AU shows a rough correlation with that of the HXR-producing electrons at the Sun, but the correlation does not fit a simple thick or thin target model. Recent analysis of several scatter-free events detected from ~0.4 to 300 keV show that they involve two separate injections, the low energy, ~0.4 to ~10 keV electron injection starts prior to the type III burst, while &gt;13 keV electrons are injected ~10! <P />minutes afterwards. The electron, radio and in situ plasma wave observations are all consistent with the type III radio emission being produced by~0.4 Â 10 keV electrons. Finally, RHESSI has detected weak HXR bursts that may be a signature of the type III burst acceleration itself and not associated with flares., , The strength and orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) has a strong effect on the high-latitude plasma convection pattern, thereby influencing the speed and direction of polar thermospheric winds. The possibility of similar IMF control over the compositional response of the thermosphere during geomagnetic disturbances has not been fully investigated. This study finds that the y-component of the IMF (IMF B<SUB>y</SUB>) exerts significant control over the development and subsequent equatorward transport of composition disturbances during periods of heightened geomagnetic activity. This is determined using the NCAR-TIMEGCM to simulate the thermospheric conditions during the first 3 weeks far-ultraviolet (FUV) imaging operations of the Dynamics Explorer 1 (DE-1) mission in 1981. The images reveal changes in the relative thermospheric column abundance of O versus N<SUB>2</SUB> (ΣO/N<SUB>2</SUB>). These changes are reproduced by the model, incorporating variable IMF strength and orientation as inputs. It is found that simple reversal of IMF B<SUB>y</SUB> leads to subsequent changes in ΣO/N<SUB>2</SUB> at middle latitudes by as much as 30%. This is a manifestation of the effect identified in the companion to this report (Crowley et al., 2006). The study confirms the hypothesis of Immel et al. (1997) that IMF-B<SUB>y</SUB> effects on middle-latitude thermospheric composition are important, though more complex than expected. Contrary to previous predictions, early morning local times are shown to be more likely to suffer large decreases in ΣO/N<SUB>2</SUB> when B<SUB>y</SUB> is negative. However, the overall magnitude of high-latitude Joule heating is found to be greater when B<SUB>y</SUB> is positive., The solar wind at Mars interacts with the extended atmosphere and small-scale crustal magnetic fields. This interaction shares elements with a variety of solar system bodies, and has direct bearing on studies of the long-term evolution of the Martian atmosphere, the structure of the upper atmosphere, and fundamental plasma processes. The magnetometer (MAG) and electron reflectometer (ER) on Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) continue to make many contributions toward understanding the plasma environment, thanks in large part to a spacecraft orbit that had low periapsis, had good coverage of the interaction region, and has been long-lived in its mapping orbit. The crustal magnetic fields discovered using MGS data perturb plasma boundaries on timescales associated with Mars' rotation and enable a complex magnetic field topology near the planet. Every portion of the plasma environment has been sampled by MGS, confirming previous measurements and making new discoveries in each region. The entire system is highly variable, and responds to changes in solar EUV flux, upstream pressure, IMF direction, and the orientation of Mars with respect to the Sun and solar wind flow. New insights from MGS should come from future analysis of new and existing data, as well as multi-spacecraft observations., Focusing of γ-rays in the nuclear-line energy regime is a feasible and promising approach for high-sensitivity γ-ray (line) studies of individual sources. This approach combines two unique advantages over ""traditional"" instrumentation for γ-ray astronomy: arcminute resolutions and a decoupling of collection and detection areas, with the corresponding potential for increased sensitivity. Laue Lenses use diffraction on lattice planes in the volume of a crystal to concentrate photons. Suitable crystals for MeV lenses exist, and lenses with &gt;100 keV bandpasses and ∼arcmin fields-of-view are feasible today. Fresnel phase shift lenses present another, longer-term possibility for γ-ray focusing. The current status of instrumentation development, lens missions under consideration, and some of the nuclear astrophysics observations such instruments could enable are described., We present optical observations of the low-luminosity Seyfert 1 nucleus of NGC 4395, as part of a multiwavelength reverberation-mapping program. Observations were carried out over two nights in 2004 April at Lick, Wise, and Kitt Peak Observatories. We obtained V- and B-band photometry, and spectra over the range 3500-6800 Å. Simultaneous Hubble Space Telescope UV and Chandra X-ray observations are presented in companion papers. Even though NGC 4395 was in an extremely low state of activity, we detect significant continuum variability of 2%-10%, increasing toward shorter wavelengths. The continuum light curves, both spectroscopic and photometric, are qualitatively similar to the simultaneous UV and X-ray light curves. Interband cross-correlations suggest that the optical continuum emission lags behind the UV continuum emission by 24<SUP>+7</SUP><SUB>-9</SUB> minutes, and that the optical continuum emission lags behind the X-ray continuum emission by 44+/-13 minutes, consistent with a reprocessing model for active galactic nucleus emission. There are also hints of Balmer emission lines lagging behind the optical continuum by an amount slightly larger than the emission-line lag detected in the UV. These results are all similar to those of other Seyfert 1 nuclei. The emission-line lag yields a mass measurement of the central black hole, which although not very significant, is consistent with the value derived from the simultaneous UV data., Previous studies have demonstrated that with the Medium Energy Neutral Atom instrument aboard the IMAGE spacecraft it is possible to remotely measure the ion temperature of the terrestrial magnetosphere during periods of strong geomagnetic activity. However, neutral atom imaging of the magnetosphere during quiet intervals is more difficult. In this work we show that by mapping neutral atom fluxes obtained over many days of observation to an equatorial plane fixed in geocentric solar magnetospheric coordinates, it is possible to construct neutral atom images of the quiet time magnetosphere. Enhanced neutral fluxes in the energy range of 1-70 keV/nucleon are observed in the quiet time premidnight region. A superposed-epoch analysis of multiple storm intervals also permits imaging of the ion temperature structure as a function of time through a geomagnetic storm. Using nearly 40 geomagnetic storms to produce average ion temperature maps as a function of storm phase, we find that there are significant differences between the spatial distribution of neutral fluxes and ion heating during the main phase of storms. Pronounced ion heating (up to 12 keV) is observed on the dayside during storm main phase from 5 to 8 Earth radii. During the early recovery phase, the ion temperature on the dayside drops to approximately 9 keV, and a colder region of approximately 6.5 keV persists near predawn. In the late recovery phase of the storm the ion temperature throughout the inner magnetosphere appears to relax to a nearly uniform 8 keV., We present a 3-D radially anisotropic S velocity model of the whole mantle (SAW642AN), obtained using a large three component surface and body waveform data set and an iterative inversion for structure and source parameters based on Non-linear Asymptotic Coupling Theory (NACT). The model is parametrized in level 4 spherical splines, which have a spacing of ~ 8°. The model shows a link between mantle flow and anisotropy in a variety of depth ranges. In the uppermost mantle, we confirm observations of regions with V<SUB>SH</SUB> &gt; V<SUB>SV</SUB> starting at ~80 km under oceanic regions and ~200 km under stable continental lithosphere, suggesting horizontal flow beneath the lithosphere. We also observe a V<SUB>SV</SUB> &gt; V<SUB>SH</SUB> signature at ~150-300 km depth beneath major ridge systems with amplitude correlated with spreading rate for fast-spreading segments. In the transition zone (400-700 km depth), regions of subducted slab material are associated with V<SUB>SV</SUB> &gt; V<SUB>SH</SUB>, while the ridge signal decreases. While the mid-mantle has lower amplitude anisotropy (&lt;1 per cent), we also confirm the observation of radially symmetric V<SUB>SH</SUB> &gt; V<SUB>SV</SUB> in the lowermost 300 km, which appears to be a robust conclusion, despite an error in our previous paper which has been corrected here. The 3-D deviations from this signature are associated with the large-scale low-velocity superplumes under the central Pacific and Africa, suggesting that V<SUB>SH</SUB> &gt; V<SUB>SV</SUB> is generated in the predominant horizontal flow of a mechanical boundary layer, with a change in signature related to transition to upwelling at the superplumes., In this paper we provide some circumstantial evidence for a holographic duality between bubble nucleation in an eternally inflating universe and a Euclidean conformal field theory (CFT). The holographic correspondence (which is different than Strominger’s de Sitter (dS)/CFT duality) relates the decay of (3+1)-dimensional de Sitter space to a two-dimensional CFT. It is not associated with pure de Sitter space, but rather with Coleman-De Luccia bubble nucleation. Alternatively, it can be thought of as a holographic description of the open, infinite, Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology that results from such a bubble. The conjectured holographic representation is of a new type that combines holography with the Wheeler-DeWitt formalism to produce a Wheeler-DeWitt theory that lives on the spatial boundary of a k=-1 FRW cosmology. We also argue for a more ambitious interpretation of the Wheeler-DeWitt CFT as a holographic dual of the entire Landscape., We calculate the thermal and dynamical evolution of the surface layers of an accreting neutron star during the rise of a superburst. For the first few hours following unstable <SUP>12</SUP>C ignition, the nuclear energy release is transported by convection. However, as the base temperature rises, the heating time becomes shorter than the eddy turnover time and convection becomes inefficient. This results in a hydrodynamic nuclear runaway, in which the heating time becomes shorter than the local dynamical time. Such hydrodynamic burning can drive shock waves into the surrounding layers and may be the trigger for the normal X-ray burst found to immediately precede the onset of the superburst in both cases in which the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer was observing., Recent global-scale observations of the postsunset equatorial O<SUP>+</SUP> airglow bands in the F region ionosphere using the IMAGE FUV and TIMED GUVI have revealed a longitudinal wave number four pattern in the magnetic latitude and concentration of the F region peak ion density when measured at a fixed local time. In a new comparison of two data sets with observations made by the OGO 4 satellite, this pattern is seen to be persistent over many days around equinox during magnetically quiet conditions close to solar maximum but can be dominated by other processes such as cross-equator winds during other periods. It is found that the longitudinal variability is created by a processes occurring in the dayside ionosphere. A longitudinal modulation of the dayside equatorial fountain is the most likely driving mechanism. Through comparison with GWSM-02 model, it is shown that the predicted modulation of the dayside thermospheric winds and temperatures at E region altitudes created by non-migrating diurnal tides can explain the modulation in the dayside equatorial fountain. This result highlights the importance of understanding the temporal variability of tropospheric weather systems on our understanding and possible predictability of the development of the F region ionosphere. It may also provide a possible further means of testing our understanding of atmospheric tides on a global scale., We show that the ratio of molecular to atomic gas in galaxies is determined by hydrostatic pressure and that the relation between the two is nearly linear. The pressure relation is shown to be good over 3 orders of magnitude for 14 galaxies, including dwarfs, H I-rich, and H<SUB>2</SUB>-rich galaxies, as well as the Milky Way. The sample spans a factor of 5 in mean metallicity. The rms scatter of individual points of the relation is only about a factor of 2 for all the galaxies, although some show much more scatter than others. Using these results, we propose a modified star formation prescription based on pressure determining the degree to which the ISM is molecular. The formulation is different in high- and low-pressure regimes, defined by whether the gas is primarily atomic or primarily molecular. This formulation can be implemented in simulations and provides a more appropriate treatment of the outer regions of spiral galaxies and molecule-poor systems, such as dwarf irregulars and damped Lyα systems., The Medium Energy Gamma-ray Astronomy Library MEGAlib is a set of software tools designed to analyze data of the next generation of Compton telescopes. The library comprises all necessary data analysis steps from data acquisition or simulation via event reconstruction to image reconstruction., PG 1115+080 is a quadruply lensed quasar at z=1.72 whose image positions are well fit by simple models of the lens galaxy (at z=0.31). At optical wavelengths, the bright close pair of images exhibits a modest flux ratio anomaly (factors of ~1.2-1.4 over the past 22 yr) with respect to these same models. We show here that as observed in X-rays with Chandra, the flux ratio anomaly is far more extreme, roughly a factor of 6. The contrasting flux ratio anomalies in the optical and X-ray band confirm the microlensing hypothesis and set a lower limit on the size of the optical continuum emission region that is ~10-100 times larger than expected from a thin accretion disk model. <P />Based on observations obtained with the Magellan Consortium's Baade and Clay Telescopes., Shortly after the prediction of the solar wind, the existence of the termination shock (TS) was proposed. Bounding the supersonic wind, the TS has long been thought as the acceleration site for anomalous cosmic rays (ACRs). On December 16th, 2004, Voyager 1 crossed the TS and entered the inner heliosheath; verifying earlier predictions of the existence of the TS. However, in sharp contrast with earlier theoretical predictions, data from Voyager 1 did not show an unfolded spectrum at the TS. Instead, the spectrum kept unfolding after crossing the shock. One possible explanation for the missing ACRs was suggested by McComas and Schwadron (2006), who argued that the deficiency in ACRs observed by Voyager 1 can be attributed to the geometry of a blunt TS. We show in this paper, with a careful consideration of the transport time scale in the inner heliosheath, that a large-scale rippling TS is necessary to apply the idea of McComas and Schwadron (2006)., Arcuate cracks, called cycloids, are ubiquitous on the surface of Europa and form as the result of diurnally-varying tidal stress. Modeling of cycloids based on tidal stress has provided evidence for non-synchronous rotation of Europa and helped to constrain its rotation rate (Hoppa et al., Science, 285:1899-1902, 1999). While fits of cycloids have improved over time, the diurnal stress model still cannot reproduce certain features, even when stress accumulated during non-synchronous rotation is taken into account. In particular, observed cycloids that are near to or crossing the equator have not been modeled successfully in previous studies. <P />Recently it has been suggested that Europa has a forced obliquity of order 0.1º (Bills, Icarus, 175(1):233-247, 2005). Hurford et al. investigated the effects of obliquity on the stress field and generated global maps of hypothetical cycloids (LPSC abstract #13.03, 2006). They found that several of the observed attributes of the global cycloidal crack pattern, which were previously not reproducible, are natural results of stress from a small amount of obliquity ( 0.1º). Here, we reexamine specific cycloids that lie near or across the equator. Previously we were unable to model these features, but inclusion of the stresses resulting from Europa's obliquity has allowed us to finally reproduce these cycloids. Our preliminary results indicate that 0.25º of obliquity is needed to fit these features. In addition, non-synchronous rotation is still required to explain how the cycloids have migrated from their formation longitudes to their current locations. Our results provide the first geologic evidence for a finite obliquity of Europa and confirm the likelihood of slow non-synchronous rotation. In order to understand the surface history of Europa, the effects of obliquity must be taken into account. When modeling cycloids, specifically, including such effects may lead to a more accurate determination of the non-synchronous rotation rate., We employ a variety of techniques to examine the timing and variability of late time x-ray flares observed in GRBs by the XRT instrument aboard the Swift spacecraft. These flares are thought to be indicative of extended activity in the central engine and produced by means similar to those which produce the prompt gamma-ray emission. We use structure function and wavelet analysis to look for an evolution of the fundamental variability time-scale between the prompt and late time emission as evidence of an expanding and cooling emitting region. We also examine the late time XRT data for pulse width evolution as evidence for internal shocks. We find tentative correlations between the flare's duration and fluence vs. the time of peak flux and examine the implications of these correlations., The Medium Energy Gamma-ray Astronomy library MEGAlib is a set of software tools for the analysis of low to medium energy gamma-ray telescopes, especially Compton telescopes. It comprises all necessary data analysis steps from simulation/measurements via event reconstruction to image reconstruction and enables detailed performance assessments. <P />In the energy range of Compton telescopes (with energy deposits from a few keV up to hundreds of MeV), the Geant Monte-Carlo software packages (Geant3 with its MGGPOD extension as well as Geant4) are widely used. Since each tool has its unique advantages, MEGAlib contains a geometry and detector description library, called Geomega, which allows to use those tools in a uniform way. It incorporates the versatile 3D display facilities available within the ROOT libraries. The same geometry, material, trigger, and detector description can be used for all simulation tools as well as for the later event analysis in the MEGAlib framework. This is done by converting the MEGAlib geometry into the Geant3 or MGGPOD format or directly linking the Geomega library into Geant4. The geometry description can handle most (and can be extended to handle all) volumes common to Geant3, Geant4 and ROOT. In Geomega a list of features is implemented which are especially useful for optimizing detector geometries: It allows to define constants, can handle mathematical operations, enables volume scaling, checks for overlaps of detector volumes, does mass calculations, etc. Used in combination with MEGAlib, Geomega enables discretization, application of detector noise, thresholds, various trigger conditions, defective pixels, etc. <P />The highly modular and completely object-oriented library is written in C++ and based on ROOT. It has been originally developed for the tracking Compton scattering and Pair creation telescope MEGA and has been successfully applied to a wide variety of telescopes, such as ACT, NuSTAR, or GRI., Detecting extragalactic radio transients will provide valuable information on several astronomical phenomena. Orphan gamma-ray burst afterglows (OGRBAs) and radio supernovae detection will be important for the theories of stellar collapse while the detection of tidal flares and variable active galactic nuclei (AGN) will provide details on massive black holes and galactic centers. In this paper we present the results of a survey we conducted using archived observations from the Very Large Array (VLA). We did not detect any transients in this set of data and from this we computed an upper limit on the rate of radio transients above 400 Jansky at 0.23 transients per square degree per year. This rules out one of several theories on the rates of OGRBAs., The distribution of a low-density hot (10^5-10^6 K) phase of the interstellar medium conveys the character and evolution of diffuse matter in the Galaxy. This, difficult to observe component of the ISM emits mainly in the far-ultraviolet (FUV) (912-1800 A) band. We present spectral maps of FUV emission lines from highly ionized species over most of the sky and discuss the ramifications. These species are likely to exist in the hot phase of the ISM. The maps were obtained using an orbital spectrometer, SPEAR (or FIMS), that was launched in 2003 and has observed the FUV sky with a spectral resolution of 500 and an angular resolution of 10'. <P />Funded NASA Grant NAG 5-5355 and by the Korean Ministry of Science and Technology., We present a map of the cosmic far-ultraviolet (FUV; 1360-1710A) continuum background over the most of the sky. The map was obtained with the ""Spectroscopy of Plasma Evolution from Astrophysical Radiation"" instruments (SPEAR/FIMS), flown aboard the STSAT-1 satellite mission. The cosmic FUV flux distribution is consistent with what is generally believed to be its dominant component, light from early-type stars scattered by interstellar dust. We report an estimate of the total FUV interstellar radiation field and compare the diffuse FUV continuum map with maps of reddening, N(HI), and H_alpha. We are developing a dust-scattering radiative transfer model to fit the FUV continuum data. The coverage and quality of our data should allow us to place simultaneous constraints on the dust and illumination parameters. <P />Funded by NASA Grant NAG 5-5355 and the Korean Ministry of Science and Technology., Laue lenses for focusing gamma rays in the energy range from roughly 100 keV up to a few MeV have been successfully demonstrated in the laboratory and on balloon flights. These telescopes concentrate gamma rays onto a small, distant focal plane detector by utilizing Bragg reflection within the volume of suitably arranged crystals. Thus collection and detection area are decoupled, enabling a significant reduction of background - which roughly scales with detector volume and constitutes the sensitivity limit of today's low to medium energy gamma-ray telescopes. <P />In order to achieve the best possible sensitivity, the focal plane instrument needs excellent background rejection capabilities, high photo-peak efficiency, and good energy resolution. Different options to achieve these goals exist, and have to be carefully balanced: For example, an active shield can be used to reduce cosmic photon background at the expense of higher background due to activation; Compton scattering can be used for background rejection, but requiring resolvable Compton scatters also reduces the photo-peak efficiency; the detector could e.g. consist of Germanium with excellent energy resolution but higher cooling requirements, or of CZT with less stringent cooling requirements but worse energy resolution. <P />We have started to explore some of the possible detector configurations, and will compare different focal plane instruments based on their narrow line, continuum, and polarization sensitivity. For this purpose simulations of the expected space radiation environment (including activation) have been performed with MGGPOD. The MEGAlib package was used to determine the achievable performance of those detectors, in an evaluation that includes each detector's individual properties such as energy and position resolution, thresholds, etc. <P />CBW thanks the Townes Fellowship at UC Berkeley for support., Calculation of the thermodynamic properties of biomolecules at high temperatures and pressures is fundamental to understanding the biogeochemistry of hydrothermal systems. Ample evidence indicates that hyperthermophilic microbes interact chemically with their mineralogical environment in these systems. Nevertheless, little is known about the thermodynamic properties of the biomolecules involved in such processes. Recent advances in theoretical biogeochemistry make it possible to calculate these properties using the limited experimental data available in the literature, together with correlation and group additivity algorithms, reference model compounds, and the revised HKF equations of state. This approach permits calculation of the standard molal thermodynamic properties of the 120 common protonated and deprotonated nucleotides and their constituent nucleic-acid bases and nucleosides as a function of temperature and pressure. The requisite equations of state parameters can be calculated from experimental standard molal heat capacities, volumes, and compressibilities reported in the literature for nucleic-acid bases and nucleosides. Because no calorimetric or densimetric data are available for the nucleotides, experimental heats of reaction taken from the literature were used together with correlation and group additivity algorithms to generate provisional values of the corresponding equations of state parameters for the nucleotides. The thermodynamic properties and revised HKF equations of state parameters generated in the present study can be used to carry out comprehensive mass transfer and Gibbs energy calculations to describe and quantify the chemical interaction of minerals and microbes in hydrothermal systems., The magnetic field topology at the coronal mass ejection (CME) source regions has been one of the major focuses of CME initiation models. While the ``breakout'' model requires a quadrupolar magnetic topology in the solar corona to enable an eruption, other models have shown that a bipolar magnetic topology can be the source region of a CME. In this paper, we use observational data and a potential field source surface model to investigate the magnetic field topology over CME productive quiescent filaments. A total of 80 quiescent filament-associated CME events during 1996-2004, spanning almost one solar cycle, with angular width &gt;=80° are selected for this study. We found both bipolar topology and quadrupolar topology at CME source regions. This observational test of the assumptions of theoretical CME models suggests that bipolar topology is more common overall and in each year. The total occurrence ratio between quadrupolar and bipolar topology is about 1:3 with this selection of events. On the rising phase of the solar cycle, there is mostly bipolar topology, but on the declining phase, there is a mixture of both bipolar and quadrupolar topology. The bipolar topology occurrence has no clear solar cycle dependence. The quadrupolar topology occurrence peaks on the declining phase in the current solar cycle 23., We present measurements of the OVI 1032Å flux from four superbubbles in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The OVI emission line was detected in spectra obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer of superbubbles N185, N186E, N51D and N57A. The locations observed were serendipitous to the extent that the primary targets in each case were stars. The stars were observed through the medium-resolution aperture, while the emission was detected in the spectra obtained through the larger low-resolution aperture. In addition, OVI emission was detected along a sight line through the LMC that did not intersect any nebula. In all cases, the OVI emission lines were centered near the LMC velocity of 275 km/s. The OVI surface brightnesses measured in these superbubble spectra lie between 11,000 and 21,000 Line Units (LU). Thus, superbubbles are brighter in OVI than hot diffuse gas both in the LMC and the Galaxy (measured surface brightnesses 1,800--9,100 LU), and fainter than supernova remnants (24,000--2,000,000 LU). <P />The detection of OVI emission implies the existence of fast shocks (velocities greater than about 160 km/s) in these superbubbles. This in turn provides supporting evidence for the presence of interior, off-center supernova remnants interacting with the superbubble shell, which are thought to be responsible for accelerating the shell and producing the bulk of the X-ray emission. We use the measured OVI surface brightnesses to place constraints on properties such as the density of the pre-shock gas and the driving pressure inside the bubbles, and we describe how these results contribute to our understanding of the energetics and evolution of superbubbles., We present the first results from three-dimensional spherical shell simulations of magnetic dynamo action realized by turbulent convection penetrating downward into a tachocline of rotational shear. This permits us to assess several dynamical elements believed to be crucial to the operation of the solar global dynamo, variously involving differential rotation resulting from convection, magnetic pumping, and amplification of fields by stretching within the tachocline. The simulations reveal that strong axisymmetric toroidal magnetic fields (about 3000 G in strength) are realized within the lower stable layer, unlike in the convection zone where fluctuating fields are predominant. The toroidal fields in the stable layer possess a striking persistent antisymmetric parity, with fields in the northern hemisphere largely of opposite polarity to those in the southern hemisphere. The associated mean poloidal magnetic fields there have a clear dipolar geometry, but we have not yet observed any distinctive reversals or latitudinal propagation. The presence of these deep magnetic fields appears to stabilize the sense of mean fields produced by vigorous dynamo action in the bulk of the convection zone., We present new high-resolution observations of Sagittarius A* at wavelengths of 17.4-23.8 cm with the Very Large Array in the A configuration with the Pie Town Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) antenna. We use the measured sizes to calibrate the interstellar scattering law and find that the major axis size of the scattering law is smaller by ~6% than previous estimates. Using the new scattering law, we are able to determine the intrinsic size of Sgr A* at wavelengths from 0.35 to 6 cm using existing results from the VLBA. The new law increases the intrinsic size by ~20% at 0.7 cm and &lt;5% at 0.35 cm. The intrinsic size is 13<SUP>+7</SUP><SUB>-3</SUB>R<SUB>S</SUB> at 0.35 cm and is proportional to λ<SUP>γ</SUP>, where γ is in the range 1.3-1.7., In the quest for precision cosmology, one must ensure that the cosmology is accurate as well. We discuss figures of merit for determining from observations whether the dark energy is a cosmological constant or dynamical, with special attention to the best determined equation of state value, at the ""pivot"" or decorrelation redshift. We show this is not necessarily the best lever on testing consistency with the cosmological constant, and moreover is subject to bias. The standard parametrization of w( a) = w<SUB>0</SUB> + w<SUB>a</SUB>(1 - a) by contrast is quite robust, as tested by extensions to higher order parametrizations and modified gravity. Combination of complementary probes gives strong immunization against inaccurate, but precise, cosmology., AU Microscopii is a 12 Myr old M dwarf that harbors an optically thin, edge-on disk of dust. The scattered light surface brightness falls with projected distance b from the star as b<SUP>-α</SUP> within b=43 AU, α~1-2, while outside 43 AU, α~4-5. We devise a theory to explain this profile. At a stellocentric distance r=r<SUB>BR</SUB>=43 AU, we posit a ring of parent bodies on circular orbits: the ``birth ring,'' wherein micron-sized grains are born from the collisional attrition of parent bodies. The ``inner disk'' at r&lt;r<SUB>BR</SUB> contains grains that migrate inward by corpuscular and Poynting-Robertson (CPR) drag. The ``outer disk'' at r&gt;r<SUB>BR</SUB> comprises grains just large enough to remain bound to the star, on orbits rendered highly eccentric by stellar wind and radiation pressure. How the vertical optical depth τ<SUB>⊥</SUB> scales with r depends on the fraction of grains that migrate inward by CPR drag without suffering a collision. If this fraction is large, the inner disk and birth ring share the same optical depth, and τ<SUB>⊥</SUB>~r<SUP>-5/2</SUP> in the outer disk. By contrast, under collision-dominated conditions, the inner disk is empty, and τ<SUB>⊥</SUB>~r<SUP>-3/2</SUP> outside. These scaling relations, which we derive analytically and confirm numerically, are robust against uncertainties in the grain size distribution. By simultaneously modeling the surface brightness and thermal spectrum, we break model degeneracies to establish that the AU Mic system is collision dominated and that its narrow birth ring contains a lunar mass of decimeter-sized bodies. The inner disk is devoid of micron-sized grains; the surface brightness at b&lt;~43 AU arises from light forward scattered by the birth ring. Inside b=43 AU, the disk's V-H color should not vary with b; outside, the disk must become bluer as ever smaller grains are probed., Both chemical weathering rates and fluid flow are difficult to measure in natural systems. However, these parameters are critical for understanding the hydrochemical evolution of aquifers, predicting the fate and transport of contaminants, and for water resources/water quality considerations. <SUP>87</SUP>Sr/ <SUP>86</SUP>Sr and ( <SUP>234</SUP>U/ <SUP>238</SUP>U) activity ratios are sensitive indicators of water-rock interaction, and thus provide a means of quantifying both flow and reactivity. The <SUP>87</SUP>Sr/ <SUP>86</SUP>Sr values in ground waters are controlled by the ratio of the dissolution rate to the flow rate. Similarly, the ( <SUP>234</SUP>U/ <SUP>238</SUP>U) ratio of natural ground waters is a balance between the flow rate and the dissolution of solids, and α-recoil loss of <SUP>234</SUP>U from the solids. By coupling these two isotope systems it is possible to constrain both the long-term (ca. 100's to 1000's of years) flow rate and bulk dissolution rate along the flow path. Previous estimates of the ratio of the dissolution rate to the infiltration flux from Sr isotopes ( <SUP>87</SUP>Sr/ <SUP>86</SUP>Sr) are combined with a model for ( <SUP>234</SUP>U/ <SUP>238</SUP>U) to constrain the infiltration flux and dissolution rate for a 70-m deep vadose zone core from Hanford, Washington. The coupled model for both ( <SUP>234</SUP>U/ <SUP>238</SUP>U) ratios and the <SUP>87</SUP>Sr/ <SUP>86</SUP>Sr data suggests an infiltration flux of 5 ± 2 mm/yr, and bulk silicate dissolution rates between 10 <SUP>-15.7</SUP> and 10 <SUP>-16.5</SUP> mol/m <SUP>2</SUP>/s. The process of α-recoil enrichment, while primarily responsible for the observed variation in ( <SUP>234</SUP>U/ <SUP>238</SUP>U) of natural systems, is difficult to quantify. However, the rate of this process in natural systems affects the interpretation of most U-series data. Models for quantifying the α-recoil loss fraction based on geometric predictions, surface area constraints, and chemical methods are also presented. The agreement between the chemical and theoretical methods, such as direct measurement of ( <SUP>234</SUP>U/ <SUP>238</SUP>U) of the small grain size fraction and geometric calculations for that size fraction, is quite good., We investigate the emission-line properties of galaxies with red rest-frame colors (compared to the g-r color bimodality) using spectra from SDSS DR4. Emission lines are detected in more than half of the red galaxies. We focus on the relationship between two emission lines commonly used as star formation rate indicators: Hα and [O II] λ3727. There is a strong bimodality in [O II]/Hα ratio in the SDSS sample that closely corresponds to the bimodality in rest-frame color. Nearly all of the line-emitting red galaxies have line ratios typical of various types of AGNs-most commonly LINERs, a small fraction of transition objects, and, more rarely, Seyferts. Only ~6% of red galaxies display star-forming line ratios. A straight line in the [O II]-Hα EW diagram separates LINER-like galaxies from other categories. Quiescent galaxies with no detectable emission lines and LINER-like galaxies combine to form a single, tight red sequence in color-magnitude-concentration space. [O II] EWs in LINER- and AGN-like galaxies can be as large as those in star-forming galaxies. Thus, unless objects with AGN/LINER-like line ratios are excluded, [O II] emission cannot be used directly as a proxy for star formation rate; this is a particular issue for red galaxies. Lack of [O II] emission is generally used to indicate a lack of star formation when poststarburst galaxies are selected at high redshift. Our results imply, however, that these samples have been cut on AGN properties, as well as star formation, and therefore may provide seriously incomplete sets of poststarburst galaxies. Furthermore, poststarburst galaxies identified in SDSS by requiring minimal Hα EW generally exhibit weak but nonzero line emission with ratios typical of AGNs; few of them show residual star formation. This suggests that most poststarburst galaxies may harbor AGNs/LINERs., A remarkable variety of particle acceleration occurs in the solar system, from lightning-related acceleration of electrons to tens of MeV energy in less than a millisecond in planetary atmospheres; to acceleration of auroral and radiation belt particles in planetary magnetospheres; to acceleration at planetary bow shocks, co-rotating interplanetary region shocks, shocks driven by fast coronal mass ejections, and possibly at the heliospheric termination shock; to acceleration in magnetic reconnection regions in solar flares and at planetary magnetopause and magnetotail current sheets. These acceleration processes often occur in conjunction with transient energy releases, and some are very efficient. Others are highly selective; for example, the acceleration in 3He-rich solar particle events enriches 3He by a factor of up to 10,000 or more relative to 4He. Unlike acceleration processes outside the solar system, the accelerated particles and the physical conditions in the acceleration region can be studied through direct in situ measurements, and/or through detailed imaging and spectroscopy. Here I review recent observations of these acceleration phenomena, our current understanding of the physics involved, and the applicability to particle acceleration elsewhere in the universe., We present here a series of numerical simulations of the development of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in a relativistically hot plasma. The physical parameters in the unperturbed state are chosen to be representative of local conditions encountered in Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe), with a main magnetic field perpendicular to a mildly relativistic shear layers. By using a numerical code for Relativistic MHD, we investigate the effect of an additional magnetic field component aligned with the shear velocity, and we follow the evolution of the instability to the saturation and turbulent regimes. Based on the resulting flow structure, we then compute synchrotron maps in order to evaluate the signature of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the emission and we investigate how the time scale and the amplitude of the synchrotron modulations depend on shear velocity and magnetic field. Finally we compare our results to the observed variable features in the Crab Nebula. We show that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability cannot account for the wisps variability, but it might be responsible for the time dependent filamentary structure observed in the main torus., I have analyzed Mount Wilson 'S' values in the California &amp; Carnegie Planet Search sample of over 1000 nearby dwarfs and subdwarfs and found correlations with evolutionary state and metallicity. In particular, among older (age &gt; 6 Gyr) stars, the minimum observed 'S' decreases with increasing [Fe/H] and increasing height above the main sequence. This effect has caused many subgiants and metal-rich dwarfs to be misidentified as ""Sun-like"" stars in a Maunder Minimum-like state. I will show how activity indicators such as R'[HK], and the canonical age-activity relation need to be revised to include the effects of metallicity and gravity on measurements of Ca II H &amp; K emission., , I discuss recent progress in the theory of the energy loss from pulsars, focusing on the advances in force free models of the magnetopshere and on dissipation in the wind, with implications of the latter for unusually models of pulsed emission. I also draw attention to the implications the new global magnetopshere models may have may have for the generation of parallel electric fields, and the implications of these for high energy emission, radio emission and the global mass loss rate through pair creation. I discuss parallel electric field formation and consequences for photon emission in scenarios with self-consistent currents, which are rather different from the standard gap models with their starvation electric fields. Finally, I remark on the importance of radiation transfer effects in unravelling the continuing mystery of pulsar radio emission., , We present Polar observations of high frequency (100 Hz $\lesssim$ f $\lesssim$ 4000 Hz) electrostatic (ES) waves at Earth's bow shock under extreme solar wind conditions. Although solitary waves are observed, the most prevalent structures in the magnetic ramp are coherent, large-amplitude (up to 80 mV/m) ES wave packets, which last 10-30 cycles, and propagate at varied obliquities relative to the magnetic field. The ES wave power is well correlated with maxima in the magnetic ramp substructure, suggesting that these maxima are important source regions. Detailed interferometric based analysis of waveforms show that they have wavelengths of a few hundred meters (e.g., ~20λ<SUB>D</SUB> ~ 0.5ρ<SUB>e</SUB>) and phase speeds at the acoustic speed, suggesting that they are ion acoustic waves (IAW)s. The IAWs, having potentials $\lesssim$1 V with no net change, are not likely to affect bulk plasma energization, though they may scatter the plasma and thus affect plasma thermalization., The <SUP>87</SUP>Sr/ <SUP>86</SUP>Sr ratios and Sr concentrations in sediment and pore fluids are used to evaluate the rates of calcite recrystallization at ODP Site 807A on the Ontong Java Plateau, an 800-meter thick section of carbonate ooze and chalk. A numerical model is used to evaluate the pore fluid chemistry and Sr isotopes in an accumulating section. The deduced calcite recrystallization rate is 2% per million years (%/Myr) near the top of the section and decreases systematically in older parts of the section such that the rate is close to 0.1/age (in years). The deduced recrystallization rates have important implications for the interpretation of Ca and Mg concentration profiles in the pore fluids. The effect of calcite recrystallization on pore fluid chemistry is described by the reaction length, L, which varies by element, and depends on the concentration in pore fluid and solid. When L is small compared to the thickness of the sedimentary section, the pore fluid concentration is controlled by equilibrium or steady-state exchange with the solid phase, except within a distance L of the sediment-water interface. When L is large relative to the thickness of sediment, the pore fluid concentration is mostly controlled by the boundary conditions and diffusion. The values of L for Ca, Sr, and Mg are of order 15, 150, and 1500 meters, respectively. L<SUB>Sr</SUB> is derived from isotopic data and modeling, and allows us to infer the values of L<SUB>Ca</SUB> and L<SUB>Mg</SUB>. The small value for L<SUB>Ca</SUB> indicates that pore fluid Ca concentrations, which gradually increase down section, must be equilibrium values that are maintained by solution-precipitation exchange with calcite and do not reflect Ca sources within or below the sediment column. The pore fluid Ca measurements and measured alkalinity allow us to calculate the in situ pH in the pore fluids, which decreases from 7.6 near the sediment-water interface to 7.1 ± 0.1 at 400-800 mbsf. While the calculated pH values are in agreement with some of the values measured during ODP Leg 130, most of the measurements are artifacts. The large value for L<SUB>Mg</SUB> indicates that the pore fluid Mg concentrations at 807A are not controlled by calcite-fluid equilibrium but instead are determined by the changing Mg concentration of seawater during deposition, modified by aqueous diffusion in the pore fluids. We use the pore fluid Mg concentration profile at Site 807A to retrieve a global record for seawater Mg over the past 35 Myr, which shows that seawater Mg has increased rapidly over the past 10 Myr, rather than gradually over the past 60 Myr. This observation suggests that the Cenozoic rise in seawater Mg is controlled by continental weathering inputs rather than by exchange with oceanic crust. The relationship determined between reaction rate and age in silicates and carbonates is strikingly similar, which suggests that reaction affinity is not the primary determinant of silicate dissolution rates in nature., , , , The point-spread function (PSF) of an adaptive optics (AO) system is often poorly known. This ignorance can lead to significant systematic errors. Since the degree of AO correction is sensitive to the observing conditions (seeing, wind speed, brightness of the wave front reference, etc.), it would be desirable to estimate the PSF from the data themselves rather than from observations of a PSF star at another time. We have developed a method to estimate the PSF delivered by an AO system in the case where the scene consists of a crowded star field. We model the modulation transfer function (MTF) of several key components of the imaging system (atmosphere filtered by an AO system, telescope pupil, and pixel array). The power spectrum of the image, even a dense star field, can be used to constrain our model, which in turn can be used to reconstruct the PSF. In the case of circularly symmetric PSFs, we demonstrate that the power spectrum of the source distribution function can be successfully removed from the measured MTF and that our fit successfully recovers input parameters from a model data set constructed from these parameters. We also show that the method yields reasonable fit parameters and a useful approximation to the PSF when applied to data from the laser guide star (LGS) AO system at the Keck Observatory. Comparison of Keck LGS AO data and Hubble Space Telescope observations with NICMOS show that photometric accuracy of a few percent can be achieved for data with Strehl ratios as low as 4%. <P />Based on observations obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory., High precision uranium isotope measurements of marine clastic sediments are used to measure the transport and storage time of sediment from source to site of deposition. The approach is demonstrated on fine-grained, late Pleistocene deep-sea sediments from Ocean Drilling Program Site 984A on the Bjorn Drift in the North Atlantic. The sediments are siliciclastic with up to 30% carbonate, and dated by δ<SUP>18</SUP>O of benthic foraminifera. Nd and Sr isotopes indicate that provenance has oscillated between a proximal source during the last three interglacial periods - volcanic rocks from Iceland - and a distal continental source during glacial periods. An unexpected finding is that the <SUP>234</SUP>U/ <SUP>238</SUP>U ratios of the silicate portion of the sediment, isolated by leaching with hydrochloric acid, are significantly less than the secular equilibrium value and show large and systematic variations that are correlated with glacial cycles and sediment provenance. The <SUP>234</SUP>U depletions are inferred to be due to α-recoil loss of <SUP>234</SUP>Th, and are used to calculate ""comminution ages"" of the sediment — the time elapsed between the generation of the small (≤ 50 μm) sediment grains in the source areas by comminution of bedrock, and the time of deposition on the seafloor. Transport times, the difference between comminution ages and depositional ages, vary from less than 10 ky to about 300 to 400 ky for the Site 984A sediments. Long transport times may reflect prior storage in soils, on continental shelves, or elsewhere on the seafloor. Transport time may also be a measure of bottom current strength. During the most recent interglacial periods the detritus from distal continental sources is diluted with sediment from Iceland that is rapidly transported to the site of deposition. The comminution age approach could be used to date Quaternary non-marine sediments, soils, and atmospheric dust, and may be enhanced by concomitant measurement of <SUP>226</SUP>Ra/ <SUP>230</SUP>Th, <SUP>230</SUP>Th/ <SUP>234</SUP>U, and cosmogenic nuclides., , , We report the final results of our study of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) with the BIMA array. Over 1000 hr of observation were dedicated to this project exploring CMB anisotropy, on scales between 1' and 2' in eighteen 6.5 arcmin FWHM fields. In the analysis of the CMB power spectrum, the visibility data are divided into two bins, corresponding to different angular scales. Modeling the observed excess power as a flat band of average multipole l<SUB>eff</SUB>=5237, we find ΔT<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>1</SUB>=220<SUP>+140</SUP><SUB>-120</SUB> μK<SUP>2</SUP> at 68% confidence and ΔT<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>1</SUB>&gt;0 μK<SUP>2</SUP> with 94.7% confidence. In a second band, with average multipole of l<SUB>eff</SUB>=8748, we find ΔT<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>2</SUB> consistent with zero and an upper limit of 880 μK<SUP>2</SUP> at 95% confidence. An extensive series of tests and supplemental observations with the VLA provide strong evidence against systematic errors or radio point sources being the source of the observed excess power. The dominant source of anisotropy on these scales is expected to be the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect in a population of distant galaxy clusters. If the excess power is due to the SZ effect, we can place constraints on the normalization of the matter power spectrum σ<SUB>8</SUB>=1.03<SUP>+0.20</SUP><SUB>-0.29</SUB> at 68% confidence. The distribution of pixel fluxes in the BIMA images is found to be consistent with simulated observations of the expected SZ background and rules out instrumental noise or radio sources as the source of the observed excess power, with confidence similar to the detection of excess power. Follow-up optical observations to search for galaxy overdensities anticorrelated with flux in the BIMA images, as might be expected from the SZ effect, proved to be inconclusive., , We discuss aspects of the problem of assigning probabilities in eternal inflation. In particular, we investigate a recent suggestion that the lowest energy de Sitter vacuum in the landscape is effectively stable. The associated proposal for probabilities would relegate lower energy vacua to unlikely excursions of a high entropy system. We note that it would also imply that the string theory landscape is experimentally ruled out. However, we extensively analyze the structure of the space of Coleman-De Luccia solutions, and we present analytic arguments, as well as numerical evidence, that the decay rate varies continuously as the false vacuum energy goes through zero. Hence, low-energy de Sitter vacua do not become anomalously stable; negative and zero-cosmological constant regions cannot be neglected., We answer the long-standing question of which production mechanism is responsible for the cataclysmic variables (CVs) in globular clusters. Arguments have been given that range from mostly primordial presence to a significant contribution of later dynamical formation in close stellar encounters. We conclude, based on a thorough analysis of a homogeneous Chandra data set, that the majority of CVs in dense globulars has a dynamical origin., We answer the long-standing question of which production mechanism is responsible for the cataclysmic variables (CVs) in globular clusters. Arguments have been given that range from mostly primordial presence to a significant contribution of later dynamical formation in close stellar encounters. We conclude, based on a thorough analysis of a homogeneous Chandra data set, that the majority of CVs in dense globular clusters have a dynamical origin., A newly discovered 1000-km scale longitudinal variation in ionospheric densities is an unexpected and heretofore unexplained phenomenon. Here we show that ionospheric densities vary with the strength of non-migrating, diurnal atmospheric tides that are, in turn, driven mainly by weather in the tropics. A strong connection between tropospheric and ionospheric conditions is unexpected, as these upward propagating tides are damped far below the peak in ionospheric density. The observations can be explained by consideration of the dynamo interaction of the tides with the lower ionosphere (E-layer) in daytime. The influence of persistent tropical rainstorms is therefore an important new consideration for space weather., Amphitheater-headed valleys on Earth and Mars are often assumed to result from erosion by emerging spring water (i.e., seepage erosion or groundwater sapping) rather than by surface runoff. The origin of such valleys has implications for landscape evolution on Earth and the hydrologic cycle and associated potential for life on other planets. In this paper we explore the evidence for seepage erosion in bedrock to address whether valley morphology can be used as a diagnostic indicator of seepage erosion. Seepage erosion is an important process in loose sediment where hydraulic forces cause grain detachment, often resulting in amphitheater-headed valleys. However, the extension of these processes to resistant rock is uncertain. In sedimentary rocks, groundwater might control the shape and rate of valley formation. It is possible, however, that seepage plays only a secondary role to runoff processes. This seems likely in basaltic valleys on Earth, where little evidence exists for seepage erosion. Since the ability of seepage to erode bedrock valleys remains unclear and because many amphitheater-headed valleys were probably carved by other processes, seepage erosion should not be inferred based solely on valley form., Several recent observations suggest that gas-poor (dissipationless) mergers of elliptical galaxies contribute significantly to the build-up of the massive end of the red sequence at z &lt;~ 1. We perform a series of major merger simulations to investigate the spatial and velocity structure of the remnants of such mergers. Regardless of orbital energy or angular momentum, we find that the stellar remnants lie on the fundamental plane defined by their progenitors, a result of virial equilibrium with a small tilt due to an increasing central dark matter fraction. However, the locations of merger remnants in the projections of the fundamental plane - the Faber-Jackson and R<SUB>e</SUB>-M<SUB>*</SUB> relations - depend strongly on the merger orbit, and the relations steepen significantly from the canonical scalings (L ~ σ<SUP>4</SUP><SUB>e</SUB> and R<SUB>e</SUB> ~ M<SUP>0.6</SUP><SUB>*</SUB>) for mergers on radial orbits. This steepening arises because stellar bulges on orbits with lower angular momentum lose less energy via dynamical friction on the dark matter haloes than do bulges on orbits with substantial angular momentum. This results in a less tightly bound remnant bulge with a smaller velocity dispersion and a larger effective radius. Our results imply that the projections of the fundamental plane - but not necessarily the plane itself - provide a powerful way of investigating the assembly history of massive elliptical galaxies, including the brightest cluster galaxies at or near the centres of galaxy clusters. We argue that most massive ellipticals are formed by anisotropic merging and that their fundamental plane projections should thus differ noticeably from those of lower mass ellipticals even though they should lie on the same fundamental plane. Current observations are consistent with this conclusion. The steepening in the L-σ<SUB>e</SUB> relation for luminous ellipticals may also be reflected in a corresponding steepening in the M<SUB>BH</SUB>-σ<SUB>e</SUB> relation for massive black holes., We present Keck optical spectra of SN 2002cx, the most peculiar known Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), taken 227 and 277 days past maximum light. Astonishingly, the spectra are not dominated by the forbidden emission lines of iron that are a hallmark of thermonuclear SNe in the nebular phase. Instead, we identify numerous P Cygni profiles of Fe II at very low expansion velocities of ~700 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which are without precedent in SNe Ia. We also report the tentative identification of low-velocity O I in these spectra, suggesting the presence of unburned material near the center of the exploding white dwarf. SN 2002cx is the prototype of a new subclass of SNe Ia, with spectral characteristics that may be consistent with recent pure deflagration models of Chandrasekhar-mass thermonuclear SNe. These are distinct from the majority of SNe Ia, for which an alternative explosion mechanism, such as a delayed detonation, may be required., We describe the Millimeter wave Anisotropy eXperiment IMaging Array (MAXIMA), a balloon-borne experiment which measured the temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) on angular scales of 10<SUP>'</SUP> to 5°. MAXIMA mapped the CMB using 16 bolometric detectors in spectral bands centered at 150, 240, and 410 GHz, with 10<SUP>'</SUP> resolution at all frequencies. The combined receiver sensitivity to CMB anisotropy was ~40 μKs. The bolometric detectors, which were cooled to 100 mK, were a prototype of the detectors which will be used on the Planck Surveyor Satellite of the European Space Agency. Systematic parasitic contributions were controlled by using four uncorrelated spatial modulations, thorough cross-linking, multiple independent CMB observations, heavily baffled optics, and strong spectral discrimination. Pointing reconstruction was accurate to 1<SUP>'</SUP>, and absolute calibration was better than 4%. Two MAXIMA flights with more than 8.5 h of CMB observations have mapped a total of 300 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of the sky in regions of negligible known foreground emission. MAXIMA results have been released in previous publications and shown to be consistent with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. MAXIMA I maps, power spectra, and correlation matrices are publicly available at http://cosmology.berkeley.edu/maxima., The ACS / HRC coronagraph has now demonstrated an unmatched capability todetect dusty debris disks around bright, nearby stars. Among the ""Big Four""debris disks discovered with IRAS twenty years ago, only Epsilon Eridani{SpT=K2V, d=3.2 pc} has yet to be targeted with ACS. Beta Pictoris,Fomalhaut and Vega have been imaged with the ACS coronagraph, with therecent detection of reflected light from Fomalhaut's dust belt {Kalas,Graham &amp; Clampin 2005}. The direct detection of dust scattered light aroundFomalhaut shows disk structure and asymmetry that can be directly linked todynamical models of planetary perturbation. Here we propose to use theACS HRC and WFC to detect Eps Eri's dust belt. A new motivation to attemptthis observations arises from recent 350 micron images that reveal two dustarcs 60 AU to the southeast and northwest of the star. Contrary to previous850 and 450 micron maps, the northwest arc is brighter than thesoutheast arc, and the northwest region has not been targeted by previousSTIS imaging at lower contrast. The optical detection of dust featuresaround Eps Eri would be significant because a high resolution optical image,together with Spitzer and sub-mm images, would help anchor dynamical modelsof Eps Eri's planetary system, in addition to providing direct visualindications of disk-planet interactions., Formation of inhomogeneous electromagnetic structures with gradients in magnetic field and intrinsic electric fields is commonly observed in magnetized plasmas. Heliospheric plasmas are susceptible to formation of localized, supersonically propagating electromagnetic inhomogeneities. Coronal relaxation may result in an emergence close to solar surface of a shock wave which traverses significant parts of the heliosphere. Shocks of solar origin may accelerate ions to high energies, and some of these ions can be trapped in quasi-stable orbits of planetary magnetospheres. The observationally deduced ion acceleration close to the Sun, at low Mach numbers and low turbulence levels, poses a dilemma regarding the energization mechanism. When the magnetic ramp of an obliquely propagating electromagnetic substructure narrows to a size of a fraction of ion skin depth, as conjectured during merging of successively propagating shocks, the trajectories of some ions exhibit strongly nonadiabatic characteristics. Subset of ions is energized while surfing along the shock due to the combined forces of magnetic fields and cross-shock electric potential gradient, forming a high-energy tail. This tail may be additionally accelerated after traversing the shock multiple times as a result of scattering and reflection due to Alfvenic wave diffusion. We follow the orbits of seed ions in a presence of a stationary, fluid-based, self-consistent model, and investigate their behavior for a variety of plasma parameters and geometries. The results indicate that (1) the energization of ions for low Mach numbers, as observed for emerging shocks close to the Sun, depends crucially on the narrowness of the electromagnetic structures, (2) the sufficiently narrow heliospheric structure can energize thermal protons and a subset of rare ions which were enriched due to impulsive coronal processes, (3) the energization is sensitive to the pitch angle of the seed population, indicating dependence on the geometry of the shock-plasma flow system, and (4) the preacceleration by surfing mechanism is a prerequisite for an additional energization due to diffusive shock acceleration. We conclude that the best configuration for an effective acceleration due to an emerging shock at small heliocentric distances and low Mach number consists of a narrow electromagnetic substructure which energizes heliospheric thermal protons directly from their thermal level, as well as trace elements which enrich the seed population due to previous coronal processes. The narrowness of the shock or its substructure and the surfing mechanism may help in explaining the observed energization when other mechanisms become inefficient due to an insufficient level of the turbulence. The energetic ion populations may have a direct profound impact on human space exploration., In the spirit of a Legacy archival program, we propose to develop apublicly-available, non-proprietary tool allowing the measurement ofthe local density of galaxies {i.e., the ""environment""} for any objectin the GOODS-N field with 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4, provided only RA, dec, andredshift. Recent studies have shown that the properties and formationhistories of galaxies depend strongly on the environment in which theyare located. By adding environment information to the uniquely deepmultiwavelength dataset available in the GOODS-N field, it will bepossible to uncover many new pieces of the galaxy evolution puzzle.Measuring environments over the entire GOODS-N field will require asmall amount of additional Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy surrounding thefield; we will make all Keck data and redshifts public as soon as theyare reduced. We can use the resulting 3d environment measurements tocalibrate the use of neighbor counts from the deep GOODS-N {original +SN search} imaging as a second measure of environment. We will usethe environment tool ourselves for two projects that utilize thenearly-unique GOODS-N HST/ACS and Chandra/ACIS data: {1} studying themorphology-density relation at z=0.5-1 down to faint luminosities; and{2} determining the typical environments of low-level AGN and testingfor relationships with host galaxy properties., During the past few years, robotic {or nearly robotic} searches for supernovae {SNe}, most notably our Lick Observatory Supernova Search {LOSS}, have found hundreds of SNe, many of them in quite nearby galaxies {cz &lt; 4000 km/s}. Most of the objects were discovered before maximum brightness, and have follow-up photometry and spectroscopy; they include some of the best-studied SNe to date. We propose to conduct a snapshot imaging survey of the sites of some of these nearby objects, to obtain late-time photometry that {through the shape of the light and color curves} will help reveal the origin of their lingering energy. The images will also provide high-resolution information on the local environments of SNe that are far superior to what we can procure from the ground. For example, we will obtain color-color and color-magnitude diagrams of stars in these SN sites, to determine the SN progenitor masses and constraints on the reddening. Recovery of the SNe in the new HST images will also allow us to actually pinpoint their progenitor stars in cases where pre- explosion images exist in the HST archive. This proposal is an extension of our successful Cycle 13 snapshot survey with ACS. It is complementary to our Cycle 15 archival proposal, which is a continuation of our long-standing program to use existing HST images to glean information about SN environments., An understanding of the processes that lead to long-term stabilization of organic matter in soils is essential to the effective implementation of strategies designed to mitigate CO <SUB>2</SUB> loss from the soil carbon reservoir in temperate climatic zones. Decomposition studies indicate that montmorillonite, a smectite that often forms with interlayers rich in Ca <SUP>2+</SUP>, greatly retards the microbial mineralization of soil organic matter. We performed a series of atomistic simulations designed to identify favorable molecular-scale organo-mineral interactions within nanoscale, hydrated complexes consisting of a humic substance and Ca-montmorillonite. Both protonated and Ca-saturated forms of the model humic molecule, representing acidic and circumneutral solution conditions, respectively, were studied within the hydrated interlayer region of a rigid-atom model of Ca-montmorillonite. The protonated humic substance formed direct hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) interactions with the clay mineral. A few polar organic groups adsorbed via water bridging interactions. The Ca-saturated humic substance adsorbed via numerous cation bridges, less numerous water bridges, and indirect H-bonding interactions mediated by water molecules. Application of molecular modeling techniques to this complex organo-mineral system thus allowed identification of interactions favorable to carbon sequestration under both acidic and circumneutral conditions., We propose to finish our Cycle 11 optical survey for nearby debris disks using the ACS/HRC coronagraph. Out of 43 orbits originally proposed for the survey, 23 orbits were allocated, leading to a survey of 22 stars, from which two new debris disks were imaged for the first time. Our analysis of the initial survey gives an empirical estimate for the detection rate of debris disks relative to heliocentric distance and dust optical depth. Our target list for Cycle 15 is now optimized to yield more frequent disk detections. Likewise our observing strategy is improved to maximize sensitivity per telescope orbit allocated. Therefore we present the most efficient survey possible. The scientific motivation is to obtain scattered light images of previously unresolved debris disks to determine their viewing geometry and physical architecture, both of which may characterize the underlying planetary system. We choose 25 debris disk targets for which we predict a detection rate of 25% ? 5%. Four targets have extrasolar planets from which the viewing geometry revealed by a disk detection will resolve the v sin{i} ambiguity in the planet masses. These targets present the remarkable opportunity of finally seeing a debris disk in system with known planets., The bright GRB 050408 was localized by HETE-2 near local midnight in the Western Hemisphere, enabling an impressive ground-based follow-up effort, as well as space-based follow-up from Swift. The Swift data from the XRT and our own optical photometry and spectrum of the afterglow provide the cornerstone for our analysis. Under the traditional assumption that the visible wave band was above the peak synchrotron frequency and below the cooling frequency, the optical photometry of 0.03-5.03 days shows an afterglow decay corresponding to an electron energy index of p<SUB>lc</SUB>=2.05+/-0.04, without a jet break as suggested by others. A break is seen in the X-ray data at early times (at ~12,600 s after the GRB). The spectral slope of the optical spectrum is consistent with p<SUB>lc</SUB> assuming a host galaxy extinction of A<SUB>V</SUB>=1.18 mag. The optical-NIR broadband spectrum is also consistent with p=2.05 but prefers A<SUB>V</SUB>=0.57 mag. The X-ray afterglow shows a break at 1.26×10<SUP>4</SUP> s, which may be the result of a refreshed shock. This burst stands out in that the optical and X-ray data suggest a large H I column density of N<SUB>HI</SUB>~10<SUP>22</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>; it is very likely a damped Lyα system, so the faintness of the host galaxy (M<SUB>V</SUB>&gt;-18 mag) is noteworthy. Moreover, we detect extraordinarily strong Ti II absorption lines with a column density through the GRB host that exceeds the largest values observed for the Milky Way by 1 order of magnitude. Furthermore, the Ti II equivalent width is in the top 1% of Mg II absorption-selected QSOs. This suggests that the large-scale environment of GRB 050408 has significantly lower Ti depletion than our Galaxy and a large velocity width (δv&gt;150 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>)., We study the mean environment of galaxies in the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey as a function of rest-frame colour, luminosity, and [OII] 3727Å equivalent width. The local galaxy overdensity for &gt;14000 galaxies at 0.75 &lt; z &lt; 1.35 is estimated using the projected third-nearest-neighbour surface density. Of the galaxy properties studied, mean environment is found to depend most strongly on galaxy colour; all major features of the correlation between mean overdensity and rest-frame colour observed in the local universe were already in place at z ~ 1. In contrast to local results, we find a substantial slope in the mean dependence of environment on luminosity for blue, star forming galaxies at z ~ 1, with brighter blue galaxies being found on average in regions of greater overdensity. We discuss the roles of galaxy clusters and groups in establishing the observed correlations between environment and galaxy properties at high redshift, and we also explore the evidence for a `downsizing of quenching' from z ~ 1 to ~0. Our results add weight to existing evidence that the mechanism(s) that result in star formation quenching are efficient in group environments as well as clusters. This work is the first of its kind at high redshift and represents the first in a series of papers addressing the role of environment in galaxy formation at 0 &lt; z &lt; 1., We present observations of 1116 current sheet crossings in the Martian magnetotail during one Martian year, as identified from magnetic field rotations measured by Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) at ~400 km altitude and 2 am local time. Crossings are observed everywhere except above strong crustal fields, and many occur in clusters, with preferred locations varying as a function of season and IMF draping direction. Magnetic polarities are consistent with day-side IMF draping directions and a two-lobe induced magnetotail. Energetic ``plasma sheet'' electrons are often absent, implying that currents can be carried by ions or low-energy electrons, with thicknesses of &lt;~100 km arguing for electrons. The presence of a thin current sheet at low altitudes, with specific seasons and IMF directions favored for some geographic locations, implies that reconnection between crustal fields and the draped IMF may play an important role in its formation and location., We have discovered an optically thick, edge-on circumstellar disk around a Herbig Ae star in the binary system PDS 144, providing the first intermediate-mass analog of HK Tau and similar T Tauri stars. This system consists of a V~13 mag primary and a fainter companion, with the spectra of both stars showing evidence for circumstellar disks and accretion; both stars were classified as Herbig Ae by the Pico dos Dias Survey. In Lick adaptive optics polarimetry, we resolved extended polarized light scattered from dust around the northern star. Follow-up Keck adaptive optics and mid-infrared observations show that this star is entirely hidden by an optically thick disk at all wavelengths from 1.2 to 11.7 μm. The disk major axis subtends ~0.8"" on the sky, corresponding to ~800 AU at a distance of 1000 pc. Bright ``wings'' extend 0.3"" above and below the disk ansae, due most likely to scattering from the edges of an outflow cavity in a circumstellar envelope. We discuss the morphology of the disk and the spectral energy distributions of the two PDS 144 stars, present preliminary disk models, and identify a number of open questions regarding this fascinating system. <P />Some of the data presented here were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation., I discuss briefly why the neutrino mass has been, is, and will be interesting as a probe to physics at very high energy scales as well as early cosmology., We report here on variable propagation effects in over 20 yr of multifrequency timing analysis of pulsar PSR B1937+21 that determine small-scale properties of the intervening plasma as it drifts through the sight line. The phase structure function derived from the dispersion measure variations is in remarkable agreement with that expected from the Kolmogorov spectrum, with a power-law index of 3.66+/-0.04, valid over an inferred scale range of 0.2-50 AU. The observed flux variation timescale and the modulation index, along with their frequency dependence, are discrepant with the values expected from a Kolmogorov spectrum with infinitesimally small inner scale cutoff, suggesting a caustic-dominated regime of interstellar optics. This implies an inner scale cutoff to the spectrum of ~1.3×10<SUP>9</SUP> m. Our timing solutions indicate a transverse velocity of 9 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> with respect to the solar system barycenter, and 80 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> with respect to the pulsar's LSR. We interpret the frequency-dependent variations of DM as a result of the apparent angular broadening of the source, which is a sensitive function of frequency (~ν<SUP>-2.2</SUP>). The error introduced by this in timing this pulsar is ~2.2 μs at 1 GHz. The timing error introduced by ``image wandering'' from the slow, nominally refractive scintillation effects is about 125 ns at 1 GHz. The error accumulated due to positional error (due to image wandering) in solar system barycentric corrections is about 85 ns at 1 GHz., The development of an ultra high energy air shower has an intrinsic energy fluctuation due both to the first interaction point and to the cascade development. Here we show that for a given primary energy this fluctuation has a lognormal distribution and thus observations will estimate the primary energy with a lognormal error distribution. We analyze the UHECR energy spectrum convolved with the lognormal energy error and demonstrate that the shape of the error distribution will interfere significantly with the ability to observe features in the spectrum. If the standard deviation of the lognormal error distribution is equal or larger than 0.25, both the shape and the normalization of the measured energy spectra will be modified significantly. As a consequence, the GZK cutoff might be sufficiently smeared as not to be seen (without very high statistics). This result is independent of the power law of the cosmological flux. As a conclusion we show that in order to establish the presence or not of the GZK feature, not only more data are needed but also that the shape of the energy error distribution has to be known well. The high energy tail and the sigma of the approximate lognormal distribution of the error in estimating the energy must be at the minimum set by the physics of showers., Laser-driven shock compression of samples precompressed to 1 GPa produces high-pressure-temperature conditions inducing two significant changes in the optical properties of water: the onset of opacity followed by enhanced reflectivity in the initially transparent water. The onset of reflectivity at infrared wavelengths can be interpreted as a semiconductor&lt;--&gt;electronic conductor transition in water, and is found at pressures above ~130 GPa for single-shocked samples precompressed to 1 GPa. Our results indicate that conductivity in the deep interior of ``icy'' giant planets is greater than realized previously because of an additional contribution from electrons., We explore the growth of supermassive black holes and host galaxy bulges in the galaxy population using the Millennium Run Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) simulation coupled with a model of galaxy formation. We find that, if galaxy mergers are the primary drivers for both bulge and black hole growth, then in the simplest picture one should expect the m<SUB>BH</SUB>-m<SUB>bulge</SUB> relation to evolve with redshift, with a larger black hole mass associated with a given bulge mass at earlier times relative to the present day. This result is independent of an evolving cold gas fraction in the galaxy population. The evolution arises from the disruption of galactic discs during mergers that make a larger fractional mass contribution to bulges at low redshift than at earlier epochs. There is no comparable growth mode for the black hole population. Thus, this effect produces evolution in the m<SUB>BH</SUB>-m<SUB>bulge</SUB> relation that is driven by bulge mass growth and not by black holes., Gallium arsenide is a promising material for large photoconductor arrays to be operated at submm wavelengths, where currently small stressed germanium arrays are used. The smaller binding energy of shallow donors in GaAs compared to Ge results in response at longer wavelengths without having to apply uniaxial stress. Use of n-type GaAs will greatly simplify the production of detector arrays and therefore allow much larger numbers of pixels. We have grown n-doped GaAs epitaxial films and demonstrated high absorption coefficients at wavelengths exceeding 300 μm. Combined with a high purity GaAs layer, a blocked impurity band (BIB) detector can be formed in order to simultaneously achieve efficient absorption and low dark currents. Recent progress in GaAs epitaxy technology allows production of such multilayer devices in wafer size. We are presenting the characterization results of our preliminary GaAs BIB structures., The globular cluster G1 (Mayall II) in M31 is the most massive (~10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>) stellar cluster in the Local Group, and it has the highest central velocity dispersion (~28 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). It has been claimed to host a central ~20,000 M<SUB>solar</SUB> black hole, but these claims have been controversial. We investigate here the XMM-Newton detection of X-ray emission from G1 at a level of L<SUB>X</SUB>~2×10<SUP>36</SUP> ergs s<SUP>-1</SUP>. This emission could be the result of Bondi-Hoyle accretion of ionized cluster gas by a central black hole, or it could be produced by a conventional low-mass X-ray binary. A precise localization of the X-ray emission, which is not possible with the current XMM data, could distinguish between these possibilities. While such a measurement may be difficult, it is of sufficient potential importance to pursue., We present radio observations of the unique, recently formed, planetary nebula (PN) associated with a very long-period OH/IR variable star V1018 Sco that is unequivocally still in its asymptotic giant branch phase. Two regions within the optical nebula are clearly detected in non-thermal radio continuum emission, with radio spectral indices comparable to those seen in colliding-wind Wolf-Rayet binaries. We suggest that these represent shocked interactions between the hot, fast stellar wind and the cold nebular shell that represents the PN's slow wind moving away from the central star. This same interface produces both synchrotron radio continuum and the optical PN emission. The fast wind is neither spherical in geometry nor aligned with any obvious optical or radio axis. We also report the detection of transient H<SUB>2</SUB>O maser emission in this nebula., The existing catalogue of Galactic supernova remnants contains only a small fraction of the true number of these stellar explosions. A different observational technique is being employed to find the missing ones., Interferometric measurements of stellar sizes in frequency bands ranging from the near-infrared to longer wavelengths give different results. Various explanations have been proposed to account for these variations in apparent size with wavelength, but none have been entirely consistent. We propose that thermal ionization in the stellar atmosphere and resulting opacity, primarily due to free-free electron-hydrogen collisions, play a significant role. Such an opacity has a quadratic dependence on photon wavelength and produces variations in the opacity of the atmosphere with wavelength, consistent with pertinent measurements. This may be particularly important for Mira-type stars, and two examples, o Ceti and W Hya, are analyzed as examples. For stars that are much smaller or with more concentrated mass, it is not likely to be significant., The large field of view (1.2 degrees), high sensitivity at ultraviolet wavelengths of 1350-2800 Å (AB magnitude about 23 in 1500 s exposure), and repeated sky coverage of the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) satellite have resulted in many serendipitous detections of variable and transient ultraviolet sources. 84 of these sources, detected during the first 12 months of the mission, have been reported in version 1.0 of the GALEX Ultraviolet Variability (GUVV) catalog by Welsh et al. (2005). Since then, new software detection tools based on aperture curves of growth, relative photometry and statistical tests have been developed that are now able to reveal many new and lower amplitude time-variable UV sources contained within the ever-expanding GALEX data archives. Here, we report on the preliminary results of implementing these variability detection tools on new data obtained with extended GALEX observations of two regions of the Hyades cluster. The cluster is known to contain many late-type M-dwarf stars that can produce highly energetic UV flares, typically of 200-1000s duration. We also report on the detection of a wide variety of other variable sources which include Seyfert Galaxies, QSOs, field flare stars and many new RR Lyrae stars, which can vary by up to 6 magnitudes in the far ultraviolet (1350-1800 Å) during their pulsation cycle. We anticipate that the RR Lyrae variables will be the predominant type of UV variable source contained in version 2.0 of the GUVV catalog., We present adaptive optics data from the Keck telescope, taken while the Huygens probe descended through Titan's atmosphere and on the days following touchdown. No probe entry signal was detected. Our observations span a solar phase angle range from 0.05° up to 0.8°, with the Sun in the west. Contrary to expectations, the east side of Titan's stratosphere was usually brightest. Compiling images obtained with Keck and Gemini over the past few years reveals that the east-west asymmetry can be explained by a combination of the solar phase angle effect and an enhancement in the haze density on Titan's morning hemisphere. While stratospheric haze was prominent over the northern hemisphere, tropospheric haze dominated the south, from the south pole up to latitudes of ~45°S. At 2.1 μm this haze forms a polar cap, while at 1.22 μm it appears in the form of a collar at 60°S. A few small clouds were usually present near the south pole, at altitudes of 30-40 km. Our narrowband J,H,K images of Titan's surface compare extremely well with that obtained by Cassini ISS, down to the small-scale features. The surface contrast between dark and bright areas may be larger at 2 μm than at 1.6 and 1.3 μm, which would imply that the dark areas may be covered by a coarser-grained frost than the bright regions and/or that there is additional 2 μm absorption there., Solar flares of GOES class M or X can produce ""super-hot"" (temperatures of 30 MK or higher) thermal plasmas. Continuum emission from such flare plasmas can dominate the X-ray spectrum up to 20-50 keV, making it difficult to separate from the non-thermal bremsstrahlung from accelerated, tens of keV electrons. Observations suggest that flare-accelerated electrons contribute significantly to heating of the thermal plasma (manifesting as the empirical ""Neupert effect""), although recent studies also suggest that other heating mechanisms may be equally significant. Accurately characterizing the thermal plasma provides information about the heating and cooling mechanisms involved, and also improves our understanding of the non-thermal emission. The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) observes solar photons with energies &gt;3 keV, with a spectral resolution of 1 keV FWHM, and is especially sensitive to flare plasmas above 10 MK. RHESSI observes both the thermal continuum and the Fe and Fe/Ni line complexes at 6.7 and 8 keV. The fluxes and equivalent widths of the line complexes are strongly temperature-dependent and are useful as probes of the thermal plasma. We present an analytical method using the ratio of the line fluxes (Fe to Fe/Ni) as a temperature diagnostic to compare with and constrain the continuum temperature measurements. We discuss results of this analysis on two X-class flares (23/Jul/2002 and 02/Nov/2003) and compare our method to the equivalent width method of Phillips et al. (2005). We also present an application of this analysis by examining the ""pre-impulsive"" phase of two flares (23/Jul/2002 and 24/Aug/2002) which both appear to show strong non-thermal emission from a coronal source., Observations of hard X-ray (HXR)/γ-ray continuum and γ-ray lines produced by energetic electrons and ions, respectively, colliding with the solar atmosphere, have shown that large solar flares can accelerate ions up to many GeV and electrons up to hundreds of MeV. Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are observed by spacecraft near 1 AU and by ground-based instrumentation to extend up to similar energies, but it appears that a different acceleration process, one associated with fast Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) is responsible. Much weaker SEP events are observed that are generally rich in electrons, <SUP>3</SUP>He, and heavy elements. The energetic particles in these events appear to be similar to those accelerated in flares. The Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) mission provides high-resolution spectroscopy and imaging of flare HXRs and γ-rays. The observations of the location, energy spectra, and composition of the flare accelerated energetic particles at the Sun strongly imply that the acceleration is closely related to the magnetic reconnection that releases the energy in solar flares. Here preliminary comparisons of the RHESSI observations with observations of both energetic electrons and ions near 1 AU are reviewed, and the implications for the particle acceleration and escape processes are discussed., FIFI LS is a far-infrared integral field spectrometer for the SOFIA airborne observatory. The instrument is designed to maximize the observing efficiency by simultaneous and nearly independent imaging of the field-of-view in two medium spectral resolution bands. We present a summary of the FIFI LS design and the current status of instrument development. Its unique features as the large far-infrared photoconductor detectors, its integral field concept, and control system will be highlighted. Special attention will be given to the Extended Observing Opportunity Program, which will allow general access to FIFI LS on SOFIA., The TEDI (TripleSpec Externally Dispersed Interferometry) is an interferometric spectrometer that will be used to explore the population of planets around the lowest mass stars. The instrument, to be deployed on the Palomar 200 Cassegrain mount, includes a stabilized Michelson interferometer combined with a medium resolution, broad band (0.8 - 2.4 micron) spectrograph, TripleSpec. We describe the instrument design and its application to Doppler velocimetry and high-resolution spectroscopy., We use argon step-release measurements to model the initial distribution of argon isotopes in 177 lunar impact spherules. The speed of modern computers permits us to approach this inverse problem in new ways, and the techniques we develop may be extended to study a wide range of samples, diffusing species, and geometries. Lunar spherules, by virtue of their simple shapes and histories, seem to be excellent candidates for inverse modeling. Nevertheless, impact spherules preserve chemical or material heterogeneities that are relics of their parent materials. As a result, we find that the distribution of argon isotopes in most impact spherules is more complex than can be meaningfully constrained by a practical number of precise measurements. The spatial distribution of argon from different sources, such as solar implantation, would be better probed in spherules by other techniques, such as stepwise etching., The Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) has observed both high-energy electron bremsstrahlung emission and nuclear gamma-ray line emission from solar flares. The gamma-ray lines are produced when energetic ions interact with the ambient medium through various processes including neutron capture and nuclear de-excitation. By comparing electron-related emission and ion-related emission in flares, one can put constraints on the acceleration mechanisms for electrons and ions. Of the gamma-ray lines, RHESSI is most sensitive to the neutron-capture line at 2.223 MeV, which is indirectly produced by protons accelerated above 30 MeV. RHESSI has observed eleven flares with significant neutron-capture line emission and can place upper limits on other flares. We compare the fluence in this line with the electron bremsstrahlung fluence above 300 keV for all RHESSI flares that extend to such energies and find a striking linear correlation between these two quantities across many orders of magnitude in fluence. This correlation implies that the mechanism that accelerates protons above 30 MeV is directly associated with the mechanism that accelerates electrons above 300 keV. On the other hand, we find only a weak correlation between neutron-capture line emission and soft X-ray emission as defined by GOES class. We also find that the correlation of the high-energy populations agrees with observations made by the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) satellite.The work at the University of California, Berkeley, was supported by NASA contract NAS 5-98033., A hybrid optical detector being developed at Berkeley has most of the attributes desired for the next generation AO wavefront sensors. The detector consists of proximity focused MCPs read out by a multi-pixel application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip developed at CERN (""Medipix2"") with individual pixels that amplify, discriminate and count input events. The detector has 256 x 256 pixels, zero readout noise (photon counting) and can be read out at 1kHz frame rates. We will report on the progress achieved after two years of our three year development effort for this detector technology funded as part of the Adaptive Optics Development Program managed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory. Details on the first vacuum tube constructed with a Medipix2 ASIC along with the fast kHz parallel electronic readout are presented. We also describe a new hybrid detector design based on HgCdTe APD arrays coupled to a Medipix2 readout that could bring zero readout noise at high frame rates to the near IR regime., The Nuclear Compton Telescope (NCT) is a balloon-borne soft gamma-ray (0.2MeV-10MeV) telescope designed to study astrophysical sources of nuclear line emission and polarization. A prototype instrument was successfully launched from Ft. Sumner, NM on June 1, 2005. The NCT prototype consists of two 3D position sensitive High-Purity-Germanium (HPGe) strip detectors fabricated with amorphous Ge contacts. The novel ultra-compact design and new technologies allow NCT to achieve high efficiencies with excellent spectral resolution and background reduction. Energy and positioning calibration data was acquired pre-flight in Fort Sumner, NM after the full instrument integration. Here we discuss our calibration techniques and results, and detector efficiencies. Comparisons with simulations are presented as well., Stray-light sources from pupil plane masks that may limit Terrestrial Planet Finder Coronagraph (TPF-C) performance are characterized <SUP>1,2</SUP> and mitigation strategies are discussed to provide a guide for future development. Rigorous vector simulation with the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method is used to characterize waveguiding effects in narrow openings, sidewall interactions, manufacturing tool-marks, manufacturing roughness, mask tilt, and cross-wavelength performance of thick Silicon mask structures. These effects cause stray-light that is not accounted for in scalar thin-mask diffraction theory, the most important of which are sidewall interactions, waveguiding effects in narrow openings, and tilt. These results have been used to improve the scalar thin-mask theory used to simulate the TPF-C with the Integrated Telescope Model. <SUP>3</SUP> Of particular interest are simulations of 100m thick vertical sidewall openings that model features typically found on Ripple masks <SUP>4</SUP> fabricated by Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) processes. <SUP>5</SUP> This paper contributes fundamental data for systematically modeling these effects in end-to-end system simulation. Leakage straight through the mask material varies greatly with wavelength, especially in Silicon (an attractive mask material due to the precision manufacturing techniques developed by the IC industry). Coating Silicon with 200nm of Chrome effectively mitigates the leakage without causing additional scattering. Thick-mask diffraction differs from the predictions of scalar thin-mask theory because diffraction spreading is confined by the mask's sidewalls. This confinement can make a mask opening look electro-magnetically larger or smaller than designed, by up to 3λ per vertical sidewall on a 50μm thick mask yet this can be reduced an order of magnitude by undercutting the sidewalls 20°. These confinement effects are sensitive to mask tilt (if light reaches the sidewalls) which can lead to an imbalance in stray-light sources and an extra wavelength of effective opening change on the illuminated sidewall., With focusing of gamma rays in the nuclear-line energy regime establishing itself as a feasible and very promising approach for high-sensitivity gamma-ray studies of individual sources, optimizing the focal plane instrumentation for gamma-lens telescopes is a prime objective. The detector of choice for a focusing nuclear-line spectroscopy mission would be the one with the best energy resolution available over the energy range of interest: Germanium. Using a Compton detector focal plane has three advantages over monolithic detectors: additional knowledge about (Compton) events enhances background rejection capabilities, the inherently finely pixellated detector naturally allows the selection of events according to the focal spot size and position and could enable source imaging, and Compton detectors are inherently sensitive to gamma-ray polarization. Suitable Ge-strip detectors that could be assembled into a sensitive high-resolution focal plane for a gamma-ray lens are available today. They have been extensively tested in the laboratory and flown on the Nuclear Compton Telescope balloon from Ft. Sumner in 2005. In the course of the ACT vision mission study, an extensive simulation and analysis package for Compton telescopes has been assembled. We leverage off this work to explore achievable sensitivities for different Ge Compton focal plane configurations - and compare them to sensitivities achievable with less complex detectors - as a step towards determining an optimum configuration., Hard X-ray (HXR) source locations in solar flares are thought to be the sites where flare-produced energetic electrons precipitate along reconnected magnetic loops and then lose their energy via collisions with ambient plasma in the lower atmosphere. According to a standard reconnection model, HXR footpoints should separate due to the successive reconnections. However, several previous studies showed that the footpoints move along ribbons or move approach to each other. To understand the characteristics of footpoint motions more systematically, a statistical survey of HXR footpoint motions in M-class and X-class flares is done using RHESSI observations. Such investigation provides a good way to test flare models., Flank-fissure eruptions involve lateral injection and propagation of magma in a volcanic edifice along pre-existing fractures in the direction of the rift zones where magma intrusion and lava flow production are concentrated over time. Thus, the identification and mapping of active fractures and faults is a fundamental aspect of studies of active volcanic systems. However, gradual dyke wedge emplacement at depth in well-fractured zones on volcano flanks and in volcanic rift zones does not necessarily trigger large amplitude deformation signals susceptible to be recorded months or even years before the actual eruption. Here we show that active and potentially eruptive areas can be detected up to 2 yrs before the arrival to the surface of the final eruptive dyke and venting of lava flows by processing satellite images applying a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) algorithm. A posteriori analysis of satellite images indeed reveals that the surficial effects of dyke wedge injection and ascent on plant growth were apparent for Mt. Etna from 2000 to 2002 and for Mt. Nyiragongo in 2001, thus months to years before they erupted., Until recently the spatial resolution of microchannel plate based photon/particle counting sensors has generally been limited by the accuracy of the readout technique. The accuracy of novel readouts, in particular cross strip anodes, have now reached the 6-10μm scale (the typical size of pores in a microchannel plate) and no longer determine the ultimate resolution limit of the detector. Although there are some issues (e.g. fixed pattern distortions seen on 5 μm scale) to be resolved for the cross strip (XS) anodes, one of the major drawbacks of the previous generation XS readouts is the low counting rate capability (10 KHz), determined by the processing electronics, in particular by the signal amplifier ASICs. In this paper we describe a new signal processing technique which should allow for high counting rates exceeding 1 MHz with the same high spatial resolution (&lt;10 μm FWHM). The slow analog sample and hold signal processing is replaced by a fully parallel signal amplification followed by digital peak detection in each output channel. The charge values in each electrode are calculated from the digitized waveforms passed into a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) where the signal peak detection and event centroiding is performed continuously. A detailed model was developed in order to optimize the digital peak detection algorithms and to determine the acceptable parameters for the electronic elements for a given spatial resolution. The results of our Monte Carlo modeling indicate that the spatial resolution of fast XS anode encoding electronics will still be better than 10 μm FWHM., We solve for the time-dependent dynamics of axisymmetric, general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic winds from rotating neutron stars. The mass-loss rate as a function of latitude is obtained self-consistently as a solution to the magnetohydrodynamics equations, subject to a finite thermal pressure at the stellar surface. We consider both monopole and dipole magnetic field geometries and we explore the parameter regime extending from low magnetization (low σ<SUB>0</SUB>), almost thermally driven winds to high magnetization (high σ<SUB>0</SUB>), relativistic Poynting-flux-dominated outflows (σ=B<SUP>2</SUP>/4πργc<SUP>2</SUP>β<SUP>2</SUP>~σ<SUB>0</SUB>/γ<SUB>∞</SUB>,β=v/c with , where ω is the rotation rate, Φ is the open magnetic flux, and is the mass flux). We compute the angular momentum and rotational energy-loss rates as a function of σ<SUB>0</SUB> and compare with analytic expectations from the classical theory of pulsars and magnetized stellar winds. In the case of the monopole, our high-σ<SUB>0</SUB> calculations asymptotically approach the analytic force-free limit. If we define the spindown rate in terms of the open magnetic flux, we similarly reproduce the spindown rate from recent force-free calculations of the aligned dipole. However, even for σ<SUB>0</SUB> as high as ~20, we find that the location of the Y-type point (r<SUB>Y</SUB>), which specifies the radius of the last closed field line in the equatorial plane, is not the radius of the Light Cylinder R<SUB>L</SUB>=c/ω (R= cylindrical radius), as has previously been assumed in most estimates and force-free calculations. Instead, although the Alfvén radius at intermediate latitudes quickly approaches R<SUB>L</SUB> as σ<SUB>0</SUB> exceeds unity, r<SUB>Y</SUB> remains significantly less than R<SUB>L</SUB>. In addition, r<SUB>Y</SUB> is a weak function of σ<SUB>0</SUB>, suggesting that high magnetizations may be required to quantitatively approach the force-free magnetospheric structure, with r<SUB>Y</SUB>=R<SUB>L</SUB>. Because r<SUB>Y</SUB> &lt; R<SUB>L</SUB>, our calculated spindown rates thus exceed the classic `vacuum dipole' rate: equivalently, for a given spindown rate, the corresponding dipole field is smaller than traditionally inferred. In addition, our results suggest a braking index generically less than 3. We discuss the implications of our results for models of rotation-powered pulsars and magnetars, both in their observed states and in their hypothesized rapidly rotating initial states., The Southern Galactic Plane Survey (SGPS) is a 1.4 GHz radio polarization and H I survey in a large part of the inner Galactic plane at a resolution of about an arcmin. Depolarization and Faraday rotation of polarized radiation from diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission, pulsars, and extragalactic sources can be used to infer information about the strength and structure of the Galactic magnetic field. Here, we discuss early results of the polarization data from the SGPS. We show from statistical analysis of rotation measures of polarized extragalactic sources that fluctuations in the magneto-ionized medium of the spiral arms are probably mainly caused by H II regions, while the rotation measure fluctuations in the interarm regions may be connected to the interstellar turbulent cascade. Furthermore, the variations of rotation measure with Galactic longitude enable modeling of the large-scale component of the Galactic magnetic field, including determination of the number and location of magnetic field reversals. Finally, the SGPS is an excellent way to study subparsec-scale structure in the ionized interstellar medium by way of depolarization studies in H II regions., Laboratory studies, numerical simulations, and desert field tests indicate that aeolian dust transport can generate atmospheric electricity via contact electrification or ""triboelectricity."" In convective structures such as dust devils and dust storms, grain stratification leads to macroscopic charge separations and gives rise to an overall electric dipole moment in the aeolian feature, similar in nature to the dipolar electric field generated in terrestrial thunderstorms. Previous numerical simulations indicate that these storm electric fields on Mars can approach the ambient breakdown field strength of ~25 kV/m. In terrestrial dust phenomena, potentials ranging from ~20 to 160 kV/m have been directly measured. The large electrostatic fields predicted in martian dust devils and storms can energize electrons in the low pressure martian atmosphere to values exceeding the electron dissociative attachment energy of both CO<SUB>2</SUB> and H<SUB>2</SUB>O, which results in the formation of the new chemical products CO/O and OH/H, respectively. Using a collisional plasma physics model, we present calculations of the CO/O and OH/H reaction and production rates. We demonstrate that these rates vary geometrically with the ambient electric field, with substantial production of dissociative products when fields approach the breakdown value of ~25 kV/m. The dissociation of H<SUB>2</SUB>O into OH/H provides a key ingredient for the generation of oxidants; thus electrically charged dust may significantly impact the habitability of Mars., Independent Okhotsk and Amurian microplate motions are tested using velocities from 123 GPS sites (80 from within the proposed OKH and AMU plate boundaries) used to constrain the plate kinematics of northeast Asia. A block modeling approach is used to incorporate both rigid block rotation and near-boundary elastic strain accumulation effects in a formal inversion of the GPS velocities. Models include scenarios with and without independent OKH and AMU plate motion. Our modeling favors scenarios with independent OKH and AMU motion, based on the application of F-test statistics. The independent OKH plate rotates 0.231 deg/Myr clockwise with respect to North America about a pole located north of Sakhalin. The modeled AMU plate rotates 0.298 deg/Myr counterclockwise with respect to NAM about a pole located west of the Magadan region. The plate-motion parameters of the independent plates are consistent with the kinematics inferred from earthquake focal mechanism solutions along their boundaries., Recent Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of distant quasars have shown strong local (z~0) X-ray absorption lines from highly ionized gas, primarily He-like oxygen. The nature of these X-ray absorbers, i.e., whether they are part of the hot gas associated with the Milky Way or part of the intragroup medium in the Local Group, remains a puzzle due to the uncertainties in the distance. We present in this paper a survey of 20 AGNs with Chandra and XMM-Newton archival data. About 40% of the targets show local O VII He α absorption with column densities around 10<SUP>16</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>; in particular, O VII absorption is present in all the high-quality spectra. We estimate that the sky covering fraction of this O VII-absorbing gas is at least 63%, at 90% confidence, and likely to be unity given enough high-quality spectra. On the basis of (1) the expected number of absorbers along sight lines toward distant AGNs, (2) joint analysis with X-ray emission measurements, and (3) mass estimation, we argue that the observed X-ray absorbers are part of the hot gas associated with our Galaxy. Future observations will significantly improve our understanding of the covering fraction and provide robust tests of this result., Spatially resolved near-infrared spectra of Titan, which simultaneously cover two CH<SUB>4</SUB> absorption bands (from 1.45 to 2.45 μm), have been obtained using the SINFONI integral-field spectrometer with adaptive optics at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) of the European Southern Observatory. We observe the enhancement in 2 μm surface albedo of the ``5 μm bright spot'' at 80°W and 24°S, and find an analogously bright region at 2 μm near 88°W and 6°S. Surface albedos are recovered at ~60 mas (375 km) resolution in both 1.5 and 2.0 μm windows using a two-stream, plane-parallel, radiative transfer model to fit the observed spectra. The surface albedos near the center of the disk range from 8 to 15% at 1.5 μm and are generally ~2% lower at 2.0 μm. Vertical (altitude) profiles of aerosol extinction that are consistent with the Huygens/DISR measurements are used to model these observations, and we retrieve latitudinal trends in both stratospheric and tropospheric aerosol extinction. On 28 February 2005 UT, the stratospheric aerosol extinction is measured to increase linearly at a rate of 0.65 +/- 0.05% per degree latitude from 40°S to 60°N. Meanwhile, the tropospheric haze near the south pole is confined to southern latitudes above 40°S and is enhanced in extinction by a factor of ~1.7 relative to the extinction measured at 10°S, the latitude where the Huygens probe landed., Diffuse far-UV emission arising from the edge of the Orion-Eridanus superbubble has been observed with the SPEAR imaging spectrometer, revealing numerous emission lines arising from both atomic species and H<SUB>2</SUB>. Spatial variations in line intensities of C IV, Si II, and O VI, in comparison with soft X-ray, Hα, and dust data, indicate that these ions are associated with processes at the interface between hot gas inside the bubble and the cooler ambient medium. Thus our observations probe the physical conditions of an evolved thermal interface in the interstellar medium., In this paper, we investigate the energy spectra produced by a simple test particle X-point model of a solar flare for different configurations of the initial electromagnetic field. We find that once the reconnection electric field is larger than 1 Vm<SUP>-1</SUP> the particle distribution transits from a heated one to a partially accelerated one. As we close the separatrices of the X-point and the angle in the inflow direction widens we find that more particles are accelerated out of the thermal distribution and this power-law component extends to lower energies. When we introduce a guiding magnetic field component we find that more particles are energised, but only up to a maximum energy dictated primarily by the reconnection electric field. Despite being able to accelerate particles to observable energies and demonstrate behaviour in the energy spectra that is consistent with observations, this single X-line model can only deliver the number fluxes required for microflares., We present SPEAR/FIMS far-ultraviolet observations near the north ecliptic pole. This area, at b~30° and with intermediate H I column, seems to be a fairly typical line of sight that is representative of general processes in the diffuse interstellar medium. We detect a surprising number of emission lines of many elements at various ionization states, representing gas phases from the warm neutral medium to the hot ionized medium. We also detect fluorescence bands of H<SUB>2</SUB>, which may be due to the ubiquitous diffuse H<SUB>2</SUB> previously observed in absorption., The ``Spectroscopy of Plasma Evolution from Astrophysical Radiation'' (SPEAR, also known as the ``Far-Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph'') instruments, flown aboard the STSAT-1 satellite mission, have provided the first large-area spectral mapping of the cosmic far-ultraviolet (FUV; 900-1750 Å) background. We describe the mission and its science motivation, the mission data and their processing, and the effects of mission performance on the science data. We present the first map of the cosmic FUV background (1360-1710 Å) over most of the sky as an example of the mission results. These SPEAR data reveal diffuse radiation from warm and hot (10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>6</SUP> K) plasma, molecular hydrogen fluorescence, and dust-scattered starlight. They allow for an unprecedented characterization of the spectral emission from a variety of environments, including the general interstellar medium (ISM), molecular clouds, supernova remnants, and superbubbles., The SPEAR (or ``FIMS'') instrumentation has been used to conduct the first large-scale spectral mapping of diffuse cosmic far-ultraviolet (FUV; 900-1750 Å) emission, including important diagnostics of interstellar hot (10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>6</SUP> K) and photoionized plasmas, H<SUB>2</SUB>, and dust-scattered starlight. The instrumentation's performance has allowed for the unprecedented detection of astrophysical diffuse FUV emission lines. A spectral resolution of λ/Δλ~550 and an imaging resolution of 5' is achieved on-orbit in the Short (900-1150 Å) and Long (1350-1750 Å) bandpass channels within their respective 4.0d×4.6 arcmin and 7.4d×4.3 arcmin fields of view. We describe the SPEAR imaging spectrographs, their performance, and the nature and handling of their data., We present a complete survey of CO (1--&gt;0) emission in the Local Group dwarf irregular IC 10. The survey, conducted with the BIMA interferometer, covers the stellar disk and a large fraction of the extended H I envelope with the sensitivity and resolution necessary to detect individual giant molecular clouds (GMCs) at the distance of IC 10 (950 kpc). We find 16 clouds with a total CO luminosity of 1×10<SUP>6</SUP> K km s<SUP>-1</SUP> pc<SUP>2</SUP>, equivalent to 4×10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> of molecular gas using the Galactic CO-to-H<SUB>2</SUB> conversion factor. Observations with the ARO 12 m find that BIMA may resolve out as much as 50% of the CO emission, and we estimate the total CO luminosity as ~2.2×10<SUP>6</SUP> K km s<SUP>-1</SUP> pc<SUP>2</SUP>. We measure the properties of 14 GMCs from high-resolution OVRO data. These clouds are very similar to Galactic GMCs in their sizes, line widths, luminosities, and CO-to-H<SUB>2</SUB> conversion factors, despite the low metallicity of IC 10 (Z~1/5 Z<SUB>solar</SUB>). Comparing the BIMA survey to the atomic gas and stellar content of IC 10, we find that most of the CO emission is coincident with high surface density H I. IC 10 displays a much higher star formation rate per unit molecular (H<SUB>2</SUB>) or total (H I+H<SUB>2</SUB>) gas than most galaxies. This could be a real difference or may be an evolutionary effect-the star formation rate may have been higher in the recent past., The remnant of the supernova of 1006 AD, the remnant first showing evidence for the presence of X-ray synchrotron emission from shock-accelerated electrons, was observed for ~1000 ks with INTEGRAL in order to study electron acceleration to very high energies. The aim of the observation was to characterize the synchrotron emission and attempt to detect nonthermal bremsstrahlung using the combination of IBIS and JEM-X spatial and spectral coverage. The source was detected with JEM-X between the 2.4 and 8.4 keV bands and was not detected with either ISGRI or SPI above 20 keV. The ISGRI upper limit is about a factor of 4 above current model predictions, but confirms the presence of steepening in the power law extrapolated from lower energies (&lt;4 keV)., We examine the pattern of star birth in the Orion Nebula cluster (ONC), with the goal of discerning the cluster's formation mechanism. Outside the Trapezium, the distribution of stellar masses is remarkably uniform and is not accurately described by the field-star initial mass function. The deconvolved, three-dimensional density of cluster members peaks at the Trapezium stars, which are truly anomalous in mass. Using theoretical pre-main-sequence tracks, we confirm the earlier finding that star formation has accelerated over the past 10<SUP>7</SUP> yr. We further show that the rate of acceleration has been the same for all masses. Thus, there is no correlation between stellar age and mass, contrary to previous claims. Finally, the acceleration has been spatially uniform throughout the cluster. <P />Our reconstruction of the parent molecular cloud spawning the cluster shows that it had a mass of 6700 M<SUB>solar</SUB> prior to its destruction by the Trapezium. If the cloud was supported against self-gravity by mildly dissipative turbulence, then it contracted in a quasi-static but accelerating manner. We demonstrate this contraction theoretically through a simple energy argument. The mean turbulent speed increased to its recent value, which is reflected in the present-day stellar velocity dispersion. <P />The current ONC will be gravitationally unbound once cloud destruction is complete, and is destined to become a dispersing OB association. We hypothesize that similarly crowded groups seen at the centers of distant OB associations are also unbound and do not give rise to the Galactic population of open clusters. Finally, accelerating star formation implies that most clumps within giant molecular complexes should have relatively low formation activity. Sensitive infrared surveys could confirm this hypothesis., The Advanced Compton Telescope (ACT), the next major step in gamma-ray astronomy, will probe the fires where chemical elements are formed by enabling high-resolution spectroscopy of nuclear emission from supernova explosions. During the past two years, our collaboration has been undertaking a NASA mission concept study for ACT. This study was designed to (1) transform the key scientific objectives into specific instrument requirements, (2) to identify the most promising technologies to meet those requirements, and (3) to design a viable mission concept for this instrument. We present the results of this study, including scientific goals and expected performance, mission design, and technology recommendations., We present far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectral imaging observations of the Vela supernova remnant (SNR) obtained with the SPEAR/FIMS instrument. The Vela SNR extends ~8° in the FUV, and its global spectra are dominated by shock-induced emission lines. We find that the global FUV line luminosities can exceed the 0.1-2.5 keV soft X-ray luminosity by an order of magnitude. The global O VI:C III ratio shows that the Vela SNR has a relatively large fraction of slower shocks compared with the Cygnus Loop., We examine the outer Galactic H I disk for deviations from the b=0<SUP>deg</SUP> plane by constructing maps of disk surface density, mean height, and thickness. We find that the Galactic warp is well described by a vertical offset plus two Fourier modes of frequency m=1 and 2, all of which grow with galactocentric radius. Adding the m=2 mode accounts for the large asymmetry between the northern and southern warps. We use a Morlet wavelet transform to investigate the spatial and frequency localization of higher frequency modes; these modes are often referred to as ``scalloping.'' We find that the m=10 and 15 scalloping modes are well above the noise, but localized; this suggests that the scalloping does not pervade the whole disk, but only local regions., Recent observations of quasi-steady magnetic reconnection in the solar wind provide an important new environment to study the physical processes related to reconnection in the collisionless plasma. Strong wave activity in reconnection regions covering a broad frequency range has been detected in laboratory experiments and in the Earth's magnetosphere and the scattering of particles by electron plasma waves has been suggested as a source of anomalous resistivity. Using observations by the WIND spacecraft we have conducted a statistical study of the plasma wave activity associated with the solar wind reconnection events identified as intervals of accelerated plasma flows in magnetic field reversal regions. The TNR (Thermal Noise Receiver) and TDS (Time Domain Sampler) experiments on WIND provide measurements to investigate in detail different plasma wave modes. In particular TDS samples electric field waveforms at rates up to 120 000 samples/s. Three different wave modes are frequently identified within and at the boundaries of the reconnection regions: Electron solitary waves, ion acoustic waves and Langmuir waves. We will present examples of typical solar wind reconnection events and discuss the characteristic and location of the associated plasma waves. We also discuss the variations in the emission intensity at low frequencies and at the plasma frequency as a function of the distance from the X-line and the distance from the separatrices., A wide variety of vacua, and their cosmological realization, may provide an explanation for the apparently anthropic choices of some parameters of particle physics and cosmology. If the probability on various parameters is weighted by volume, a flat potential for slow-roll inflation is also naturally understood, since the flatter the potential the larger the volume of the subuniverse. However, such inflationary landscapes have a serious problem, predicting an environment that makes it exponentially hard for observers to exist and giving an exponentially small probability for a moderate universe like ours. A general solution to this problem is proposed, and is illustrated in the context of inflaton decay and leptogenesis, leading to an upper bound on the reheating temperature in our subuniverse. In a particular scenario of chaotic inflation and nonthermal leptogenesis, predictions can be made for the size of CP violating phases, the rate of neutrinoless double beta decay and, in the case of theories with gauge-mediated weak-scale supersymmetry, for the fundamental scale of supersymmetry breaking., The RHESSI (Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager) mission detects solar flare hard X-ray/gamma- ray bremsstrahlung continuum and gamma-ray line emissions produced by energetic electrons and ions, respectively, colliding with the solar atmosphere. I review here the comparisons of the timing, location, and spectra of energetic electrons and ions at the Sun, inferred from the RHESSI observations; with the timing, location and spectra of energetic electrons and ions in impulsive and gradual SEP events directly observed in situ near 1 AU by Wind, ACE, and other near-earth spacecraft. Generally, scattering of the SEPs in their interplanetary propagation to 1 AU produces a diffusive time profile that masks the acceleration/injection near the Sun. A few impulsive events exhibit nearly scatter -free propagation (especially for electrons) so they can be accurately traced back to the Sun. These events show two electron injections, one for the &lt;~1 - 10 keV electrons, early enough to produce the type III solar radio burst; and a second injection for &gt;~10-15 keV electrons about ten minutes later. Energetic ions in these impulsive events appear to be injected even later. These impulsive events often lack a flare, but appear to be related to small, &gt;~600km/s coronal mass ejections., A model is presented that simulates anisotropy development in a subducting slab from the upper-lower mantle boundary (661 km) to the core-mantle boundary (2891 km). Two phases are considered: orthorhombic MgSiO <SUB>3</SUB>-perovskite and cubic magnesiowuestite (Mg,Fe)O. Single crystal elastic properties at mantle conditions are obtained from existing density functional theory calculations and quasiharmonic approximation. It is assumed that deformation is accommodated by slip. A polycrystal plasticity model predicts strong texture development for perovskite and weaker texture for magnesiowuestite. When averaging single crystal elastic properties with the orientation distribution this results for both phases in weak P-wave anisotropy and shear wave splitting in the upper part of the lower mantle but pronounced anisotropy near the core-mantle boundary (up to 4% for V<SUB>p</SUB> and 7% for V<SUB>s</SUB>). The anisotropy pattern is complex and asymmetric and local heterogeneity is expected. These predictions are consistent with seismic observations., Propagating disturbances in the tropical atmosphere exhibiting characteristics of linear equatorial waves have been shown to be ``coupled'' to convection. In some cases, a rain event at a specific location can be associated with a particular wave of sufficiently large amplitude. Rain events spanning three years at Kwajalein Atoll, Republic of the Marshall Islands, 8.72°N 167.73°E, are classified by associated wave type (i.e. Kelvin or mixed Rossby-gravity (MRG)) using space-time spectral-filtered outgoing longwave radiation (OLR). Contoured frequency by altitude diagrams (CFADs) of radar for the classified dates were compared between the two groups. The Kelvin wave accumulated CFAD has a distribution shifted to lower reflectivities compared to MRG suggesting that Kelvin storms likely contain a larger fraction of stratiform to convective area compared to MRG storms., Ground-based robotic telescopes have proven essential in the first 6 months of Swift operation. The robotic optical 0.7m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT) and the robotic infra-red 1.3m Peters Automated Infrared Imaging Telescope (PAIRITEL) have contributed important observations during this period, and we discuss efforts to leverage the capabilities of each system to perform rapid, joint observations in the optical and infra-red. An autonomously paired KAIT/PAIRITEL system offers the potential to rapidly discover highly dust extincted bursts or bursts occurring at high redshifts (z &gt;~ 5) as near-IR dropouts., The precession of the Polar spacecraft orbit has placed its apogee (~9 Re) near the equator during 2000- 2003, allowing correlative studies of electric fields and plasmas between Polar and the satellites of the Cluster constellation (apogee ~19 Re). This has allowed us to preview the sorts of radial and azimuthal alignments planned for the inner satellites of the THEMIS mission, and to better understand the relationships between the in-situ plasma and field measurements and the ground-based signatures of substorm onset. A particularly clear example of correlated, rapid, and large-amplitude electric field fluctuations associated with strong plasma flows and ground signatures of substorm onset was observed on Polar and Cluster on 20 September 2003. This particular event has features that suggest important macro- and micro-scale ramifications of the electromagnetic fluctuations associated with substorm onset in the tail. The onset of electromagnetic fluctuations and strong flows at both Polar and Cluster are close to simultaneous, indicating a onset occurring between the two spacecraft, near 13 Re downtail. Ion flows as measured by Cluster/CIS are a few hundred km/s in magnitude in a relatively high-temperature environment (~14 keV). ExB flows derived from both Polar EFI and Cluster EFW indicate much higher speed flows (several thousand km/s), consistent with the observed time delays between Polar and Cluster (The discrepancy between the CIS flows and ExB flows arise primarily from instrumental background effects in the CIS data). Significant cross-tail flows at both Polar and Cluster suggest flow diversions even over the relatively short streamlines between the onset site and the spacecraft positions., The Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) is planned for launch in late Summer 2006. STEREO will study the Sun with two spacecraft in orbit around the Sun moving on opposite sides of Earth. The primary science goal is to understand the nature of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). This presentation will focus on one of the informal education efforts of our E/PO program for the IMPACT instrument suite aboard STEREO. We will share our participation in NASA's Sun-Earth Day event which is scheduled to coincide with a total solar eclipse in March and is titled In a Different Light. We will show how this live eclipse Webcast, which reaches thousands of science center attendees, can inspire the public to observe, understand and be part of the Sun-Earth-Moon system. We will present video clips of STEREO-IMPACT team members Janet Luhmann and Nahide Craig participating in the Exploratorium's live Webcast of the 2006 solar eclipse on location from Side, Turkey, and the experiences and remarks of the other STEREO scientist from the path of totality from Africa., The unique ability to record photon X,Y,T high fidelity information has advantages for high speed recording devices for some important time dependent applications. For microchannel plate sensors our most commonly used readout configuration is the cross delay line anode. We have achieved resolutions of &lt; 25 μm in tests over 65 mm x 65 mm (&gt;2.5k x 2.5k resolution elements) with excellent linearity for random photon rates of &gt; 500 kHz, while time tagging events using the MCP output signal to better than 100 ps. Open face and sealed tube microchannel plate cross delay line detectors of this kind have been built and used for observation of flare stars, orbital satellites and space debris with the GALEX satellite, time resolved imaging of the Crab Pulsar with a telescope as small as 1m, biological fluorescence imaging and synchrotron diagnostics. To achieve better efficiency, higher counting rate and extended lifetime we are now developing cross strip anode readouts. These have already demonstrated 5μm resolution at &lt;10x lower gain than the cross delay line schemes, and high speed electronics for the cross strip are currently in development., During the magnetospheric disturbances of January 21, 2005 the MINIS balloon campaign observed intense X- ray bursts at three locations separated in L-shell and local time. These X-rays are bremsstrahlung radiation produced by highly relativistic (~1MeV) electrons precipitating out of the outer radiation belt. We will present a brief background on single-point observations from previous balloon campaigns and show the unique structure revealed by the MINIS multi-point observations. We then model the bremsstrahlung production and atmospheric scattering to obtain the energy spectrum and flux of precipitating electrons as a function of time at each of the balloon locations. This talk will focus on the spectral shape and the temporal variability of the spectra at each balloon., We report initial results from an automated XRT spectral pipeline running at Berkeley. The data are fit in near real time and searched for emission lines. For the period between GRBs 050401 and 051117B, there are nearly 12 Msec of XRT data, which can be divided into 67 spectra each with &gt; 500 cts. We discuss limits on Fe line emission for the bursts with measured redshifts. We find no highly significant emission lines as outliers in the overall population. However, there are interesting outliers in terms of the continuum fit parameters. From this we find evidence for thermal emission components in some of the bright XRT flares. Our automated software performs a blind search for emission lines and appears to also trigger on these regions of particularly soft spectra. This may indicate that some of the soft flare emission is in the form of lines., We present some useful ways to visualize the nature of dark energy and the effects of the accelerating expansion on cosmological quantities. Expansion probes such as Type Ia supernovae distances and growth probes such as weak gravitational lensing and the evolution of large scale structure provide powerful tests in complementarity. We present a ''ladder'' diagram, showing that in addition to dramatic improvements in precision, next generation probes will provide insight through an increasing ability to test assumptions of the cosmological framework, including gravity beyond general relativity., Fluxes of relativistic (~MeV) electrons in the Earth's radiation belts are highly variable on time scales from a few hours to months. Even similar geomagnetic storms show variability, either increasing or decreasing the measured relativistic electron flux. This variability in flux represents a dynamic balance between acceleration of new electrons to high energies and losses of the existing population. Losses set the boundaries for the belts and can be strong enough to deplete relativistic electron populations in the belts on the order of a day. This talk will review direct observations of losses as well as those inferred from flux dropouts and we will examine the proposed source of these losses including adiabatic motion, drift out the magnetopause, outward radial diffusion, and scattering into the atmosphere by resonance with EMIC, whistler mode waves and plasmaspheric hiss. The ability to identify and quantify the time and space dependent importance of these loss processes is essential to understanding the flux variability of radiation belt relativistic electrons., The upcoming STEREO mission's IMPACT and PLASTIC investigations will provide the first opportunity for long duration, detailed observations of 1 AU magnetic field structures, plasma ions and electrons, suprathermal electrons, and energetic particles at points bracketing Earth's heliospheric location. Stereoscopic/3D information from the STEREO SECCHI imagers and SWAVES radio experiment will make it possible to use both multipoint and quadrature studies to connect interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICME) and solar wind structures to CMEs and coronal holes observed at the Sun. To fully exploit these unique data sets, tight integration with similarly equipped missions at L1 will be essential, particularly WIND and ACE. The STEREO mission is building novel data analysis tools to take advantage of the mission's scientific potential. These tools will require reliable access and a well-documented interface to the L1 data sets. Such an interface already exists for ACE through the ACE Science Center. We plan to provide a similar service for the WIND mission that will supplement existing CDAWeb services. Building on tools also being developed for STEREO, we will create a SOAP application program interface (API) which will allow both our STEREO/WIND/ACE interactive browser and third-party software to access WIND data as a seamless and integral part of the STEREO mission. The API will also allow for more advanced forms of data mining than currently available through other data web services. Access will be provided to WIND-specific data analysis software as well. The development of cross-spacecraft data analysis tools will allow a larger scientific community to combine STEREO's unique in-situ data with those of other missions, particularly the L1 missions, and, therefore, to maximize STEREO's scientific potential in gaining a greater understanding of the heliosphere., Using WIND/3DP electron data from 1996 through 2005, we investigate the injection at the Sun of nine scatter- free impulsive electron events with good count statistics, the electron energy range from ~1keV to above 60 keV and the simple association with the solar and interplanetary type III radio burst observed by WIND/WAVES. Taking into account the effects of interplanetary propagation and instrumental response, we find that the observed time profiles of electron fluxes at all energies fit quite well to triangular injections at the Sun with equal rise and fall times. We find double injections: One for &lt;~ 1 to 6-9 keV electrons begins 4.6± 2.6 min before the start of type III burst and lasts for an averaged duration of 90 min, while a second for electrons above 9-13 keV starts 6.9±0.7 min after the start of the type III burst and lasts for an average of 24 min. Electrons of low-energy injection are likely to be the source of the type III burst. The majority of events might have a B or C class GOES SXR flare related to the start of low-energy electron injection, three might have a B or C class SXR flare related to the start of high-energy injection, and five might have a west- limb CME with the velocity &lt;~600km/s., The Mars Odyssey spacecraft carries two experiments that are capable of detecting cosmic gamma-ray bursts and soft gamma repeaters. Since 2001 April they have detected over 275 bursts and, in conjunction with the other spacecraft of the interplanetary network, localized many of them rapidly and precisely enough to allow sensitive multiwavelength counterpart searches. We present the Mars Odyssey mission and describe the burst capabilities of the two experiments in detail. We explain how the spacecraft timing and ephemeris have been verified in-flight using bursts from objects whose precise positions are known by other means. Finally, we show several examples of localizations and discuss future plans for the Odyssey mission and the network as a whole., We estimate the luminosity evolution and formation rate for more than 900 GRBs by using redshift and luminosity data calculated by Band, Norris, &amp; Bonnell via the lag-luminosity correlation. By applying maximum likelihood techniques, we are able to infer the true distribution of the parent GRB population's luminosity function and density distributions in a way that accounts for detector selection effects. We find that after accounting for data truncation, there still exists a significant correlation between the average luminosity and redshift, indicating that distant GRBs are on average more luminous than nearby counterparts. This is consistent with previous studies showing strong source evolution and also recent observations of underluminous nearby GRBs. We find no evidence for beaming angle evolution in the current sample of GRBs with known redshift, suggesting that this increase in luminosity cannot be due to an evolution of the collimation of gamma-ray emission. The resulting luminosity function is well fit with a single power law of index L<SUP>'-1.5</SUP>, which is intermediate between the values predicted by the power-law and Gaussian structured jet models. We also find that the GRB comoving rate density rises steeply, with a broad peak between 1=z=2 followed by a steady decline above z&gt;3. This rate density qualitatively matches the current estimates of the cosmic star formation rate, favoring a short-lived massive star progenitor model or a binary model with a short delay between the formation of the compact object and the eventual merger., AMANDA is a high energy neutrino telescope consisting of 677 optical modules at 1.5-2 km depth in glacial ice at the south pole. We summarize AMANDA results for observation of atmospheric neutrinos and searches of extraterrestrial neutrinos from point sources, gamma ray bursts and diffuse fluxes. Upper limits at 90%CL are presented. The status of IceCube, the 1 km<SUP>3</SUP> successor to AMANDA currently under construction is presented., The pursuit of the progenitors of short duration-hard spectrum gamma-ray bursts (SHBs) draws strongly upon similar quests for the origin of supernovae (SNe) and long duration-soft spectrum GRBs (LSBs). Indeed the notion that, in the absence of smoking guns, the progenitors of cosmic explosions betray their identities both on the global and local scale, motivates the study of SHB redshifts, host galaxies, and locations with respect to hosts. To this end, we suggest both a historical and emergent physical analogy of GRBs with SNe: long-soft GRBs are to core-collapsed supernovae as short-hard GRBs are to Type Ia supernovae (``LSB:CC::SHB:Ia''). Still, the SHB progenitor pursuit is just beginning and we caution that while there are some substantive differences between observations of LSBs and SHBs on large-scales, particularly in host demographics, neither the offset nor the redshift distributions of SHBs are yet (statistically) distinct with those of LSBs., Precise radial velocity measurements have led to the discovery of ~170 extrasolar planetary systems. Understanding the uncertainties in the orbital solutions will become increasingly important as the discovery space for extrasolar planets shifts to planets with smaller masses and longer orbital periods. The method of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) provides a rigorous method for quantifying the uncertainties in orbital parameters in a Bayesian framework (Paper I). The main practical challenge for the general application of MCMC is the need to construct Markov chains that quickly converge. The rate of convergence is very sensitive to the choice of the candidate transition probability distribution function (CTPDF). Here we explain one simple method for generating alternative CTPDFs that can significantly speed convergence by 1-3 orders of magnitude. We have numerically tested dozens of CTPDFs with simulated radial velocity data sets to identify those that perform well for different types of orbits and suggest a set of CTPDFs for general application. In addition, we introduce other refinements to the MCMC algorithm for radial velocity planets, including an improved treatment of the uncertainties in the radial velocity observations, an algorithm for automatically choosing step sizes, an algorithm for automatically determining reasonable stopping times, and the use of importance sampling for including the dynamical evolution of multiple-planet systems. Together, these improvements make it practical to apply MCMC to multiple-planet systems. We demonstrate the improvements in efficiency by analyzing a variety of extrasolar planetary systems., We report a fortuitous two-spacecraft conjunction when Geotail and Wind observed the occurrence of reconnection simultaneously at the subsolar and dawn tail flank magnetopause during stable B<SUB>y</SUB> dominated IMF. Furthermore, bi-directional jets were observed by Geotail which indicate the presence of an X-line in the subsolar region. These observations are consistent with the presence of a tilted X-line hinged near the subsolar point and spanning the entire dayside (from subsolar to X<SUB>GSE</SUB> = -10 R<SUB>E</SUB>) magnetopause, as expected from component reconnection. In addition, our observations do not reveal any thickening of the boundary layer down the flanks, the plasma boundary layer being confined to the reconnecting magnetopause current layer. This suggests that reconnection dominates over diffusive entry or Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the low latitude magnetopause even when the IMF clock angle is 90°., We present Keck spectropolarimetry of the unusual Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2005hk several days before maximum light. An analysis of the high signal-to-noise ratio total-flux spectrum shows the object's extreme similarity to the peculiar SN 2002cx. SN 2005hk has an optical spectrum dominated by Fe III lines and only weak lines of intermediate-mass elements, unlike a normal SN Ia at this epoch. The photospheric velocity measured from the minima of strong absorption lines is very low for an SN Ia (~6000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), solidifying the connection to SN 2002cx. The spectrum-synthesis code SYNOW was used to identify the presence of iron-peak elements, intermediate-mass elements, and possibly unburned carbon at similar velocities in the outer ejecta of SN 2005hk. Many weak spectral features remain unidentified. The spectropolarimetry shows a low level of continuum polarization (~0.4%) after correction for the interstellar component, and only a weak Fe III line feature is detected. The level of continuum polarization is normal for an SN Ia, implying that the unusual features of SN 2005hk cannot be readily explained by large asymmetries., Although N-body simulations of cosmic structure formation suggest that dark matter halos have density profiles shallower than isothermal at small radii and steeper at large radii, whether observed galaxy clusters follow this profile is still ambiguous. We use one such density profile, the asymmetric Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, to model the mass distributions of 10 galaxy clusters with gravitational arcs observed by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We characterize the galaxy lenses in each cluster as NFW ellipsoids, each defined by an unknown scale convergence, scale radius, ellipticity, and position angle. For a given set of values of these parameters, we compute the arcs that would be produced by such a lens system. To define the goodness of fit to the observed arc system, we define a χ<SUP>2</SUP> function encompassing the overlap between the observed and reproduced arcs, as well as the agreement between the predicted arc sources and the observational constraints on the source system. We minimize this χ<SUP>2</SUP> to find the values of the lens parameters that best reproduce the observed arc system in a given cluster. Here we report our best-fit lens parameters and corresponding mass estimates for each of the 10 lensing clusters. We find that cluster mass models based on lensing galaxies defined as NFW ellipsoids can accurately reproduce the observed arcs and that the best-fit parameters to such a model fall within the reasonable ranges defined by simulations. These results assert NFW profiles as an effective model for the mass distributions of observed clusters., We compared near-infrared observations of the recently discovered outer rings of Uranus with Hubble Space Telescope results. We find that the inner ring, R/2003 U 2, is red, whereas the outer ring, R/2003 U 1, is very blue. Blue is an unusual color for rings; Saturn's enigmatic E ring is the only other known example. By analogy to the E ring, R/2003 U 1 is probably produced by impacts into the embedded moon Mab, which apparently orbits at a location where nongravitational perturbations favor the survival and spreading of submicron-sized dust. R/2003 U 2 more closely resembles Saturn's G ring, which is red, a typical color for dusty rings., The Radio Astronomy Laboratory of the University of California, Berkeley is developing a 1 W at 80 K pulse tube refrigerator driven by a clearance seal linear compressor for use on the Allen Telescope Array. Second generation refrigerators show improved performance compared to the first generation, now achieving cooling power fairly close to model predictions. Compressors for the second-generation refrigerators are compact, electron-beam welded packages. One refrigerator was operated for 3070 hours, giving steady performance. For the third generation refrigerators we are hoping to better understand performance variations from one unit to another and to further improve the performance. Third generation units will have the reservoir integrated into the compressor and incorporate changes aimed at easier manufacturing., Hydrogeological systems are earth systems influenced by water. Their behaviors are governed by interacting processes, including flow of fluids, deformation of porous materials, chemical reactions, and transport of matter and energy. Here, coupling among three of these processes is considered: flow of water, heat, and deformation, each of which is represented by a diffusion-type of partial differential equation. One side of the diffusion-type equation relates to motion of matter or energy, while the other relates to temporal changes of state variables at a given location. The coupling arises from processes that govern motion as well as those that relate to change of state. In this work, attention is devoted to coupling arising from changes in state. Partial derivatives of equations of state constitute the capacitance terms of diffusion-type equations. Of the many partial derivatives that are mathematically possible in physical systems characterized by several variables, only a few are physically significant. Because the state variables are related to each other through an equation of state, the partial derivatives must collectively satisfy a closure criterion. This framework offers a systematic way of developing the coupled set of equations that govern hydrogeological systems involving the flow of water, heat, and deformation. Such systems are described in terms of four variables, and the associated partial derivatives. The physical import of these derivatives are discussed, followed by a description of partial derivatives that are of practical interest. These partial derivatives are then used as the basis to develop a set of coupled equations. A brief discussion is presented on coupled equations from a perspective of energy optimization, We consider the question of asymptotic observables in cosmology. We assume that string theory contains a landscape of vacua, and that metastable de Sitter regions can decay to a zero cosmological constant by bubble nucleation. The asymptotic properties of the corresponding bounce solution should be incorporated in a nonperturbative quantum theory of cosmology. A recent proposal for such a framework defines an S matrix between the past and future boundaries of the bounce. We analyze in detail the properties of asymptotic states in this proposal, finding that generic small perturbations of the initial state cause a global crunch. We conclude that late-time amplitudes should be computed directly. This would require a string theory analog of the no-boundary proposal., We have measured the profiles of the Ca II H and K chromospheric emission lines in 147 main-sequence stars of spectral type M5-K7 (masses 0.30-0.55 M<SUB>solar</SUB>) using multiple high-resolution spectra obtained during 6 years with the HIRES spectrometer on the Keck I telescope. Remarkably, the average FWHM, equivalent widths, and line luminosities of Ca II H and K increase by a factor of 3 with increasing stellar mass over this small range of stellar masses. We fit the Ca II H and K lines with a double-Gaussian model to represent both the chromospheric emission and the non-LTE central absorption. Most of the sample stars display a central absorption that is typically redshifted by ~0.1 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> relative to the emission. This implies that the higher level, lower density chromospheric material has a smaller outward velocity (or higher inward velocity) by 0.1 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> than the lower level material in the chromosphere, but the nature of this velocity gradient remains unknown. The FWHM of the Ca II H and K emission lines increase with stellar luminosity, reminiscent of the Wilson-Bappu effect in FGK-type stars. Both the equivalent widths and FWHM exhibit modest temporal variability in individual stars. At a given value of M<SUB>V</SUB>, stars exhibit a spread in both the equivalent width and FWHM of Ca II H and K, due both to a spread in fundamental stellar parameters, including rotation rate, age, and possibly metallicity, and to the spread in stellar mass at a given M<SUB>V</SUB>. The K line is consistently wider than the H line, as expected, and its central absorption is more redshifted, indicating that the H and K lines form at slightly different heights in the chromosphere where the velocities are slightly different. The equivalent width of Hα correlates with Ca II H and K only for stars having Ca II equivalent widths above ~2 Å, suggesting the existence of a magnetic threshold above which the lower and upper chromospheres become thermally coupled. <P />Based on observations obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated jointly by the University of California and the California Institute of Technology. Keck time has been granted by both NASA and the University of California., We determine the disk mass distribution around 336 stars in the young (~1 Myr) Orion Nebula cluster by imaging a 2.5 arcinm × 2.5 arcmin region in 3 mm continuum emission with the Owens Valley Millimeter Array. For this sample of 336 stars, we observe 3 mm emission above the 3 σ noise level toward 10 sources, six of which have also been detected optically in silhouette against the bright nebular background. In addition, we detect 20 objects in 3 mm continuum emission that do not correspond to known near-IR cluster members. Comparisons of our measured fluxes with longer wavelength observations enable rough separation of dust emission from thermal free-free emission, and we find substantial dust emission toward most objects. For the sample of 10 objects detected at both 3 mm and near-IR wavelengths, eight exhibit substantial dust emission. Excluding the two high-mass stars (θ<SUP>1</SUP> Ori A and the BN object) and assuming a gas-to-dust ratio of 100, we estimate circumstellar masses ranging from 0.13 to 0.39 M<SUB>solar</SUB>. For the cluster members not detected at 3 mm, images of individual objects are stacked to constrain the mean 3 mm flux of the ensemble. The average flux is detected at the 3 σ confidence level and implies an average disk mass of 0.005 M<SUB>solar</SUB>, comparable to the minimum-mass solar nebula. The percentage of stars in Orion surrounded by disks more massive than ~0.1 M<SUB>solar</SUB> is consistent with the disk mass distribution in Taurus, and we argue that massive disks in Orion do not appear to be truncated through close encounters with high-mass stars. Comparison of the average disk mass and number of massive dusty structures in Orion with similar surveys of the NGC 2024 and IC 348 clusters is used to constrain the evolutionary timescales of massive circumstellar disks in clustered environments., Located in the northwestern United States, the Newberry Hotspot Track consists of a sequence of age-progressive silicic volcanic domes and lava flows, showing a monotonic age progression from east to west ending at the Newberry Caldera. While mantle plumes are often called upon to explain hotspot tracks, the Newberry track cannot be the direct product of plate motion over a stationary mantle source as its orientation is ∼120° to plate motion, making it a good case study for alternative causal mechanisms of hotspot tracks. Four end-member tectonic models have been proposed: (1) subduction counterflow, (2) gravitational flow along the base of the lithosphere, (3) lithospheric faulting, and (4) extension of the Basin and Range. To get fabric information about the asthenosphere and constrain the possible flow fields beneath the Newberry track, SKS splitting measurements were made for 27 events at 12 stations of the Oregon Array for Teleseismic Study (OATS) along the track. A gradual rotation of the fast direction is observed from ENE-WSW at the northwest end of the array to E-W to the southeast and the delay times average 1.65 s. We infer that the SKS splits are the product of anisotropy in the asthenosphere and the anisotropy orientation does not vary with depth beneath the track. The average fast directions ENE-WSW to the northwest are consistent with generation by mantle shear parallel to the subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate, and the more E-W fast directions to the east are perhaps due to shear caused by the Basin and Range extension. Since the observed fast directions are not parallel to the Newberry track, as the subduction counterflow model or the gravitational flow model suggests, the age-progressive volcanism is unlikely a direct product of asthenospheric flow. Instead, we propose that the Newberry track is the product of lithosphere-controlled processes., We use Lunar Prospector data to identify 990 magnetic enhancements, previously termed ``limb shocks'' or ``limb compressions'', external to the lunar wake. We find that they are clearly associated with lunar crustal sources, and sometimes occur far upstream from the limb at altitudes of ~100 km. This is inconsistent with compressional disturbances convecting downstream with the solar wind, and implies that crustal fields are sometimes strong and coherent enough to produce a fluid-like interaction where compressional waves steepen to form a shock extending upstream from their source. The likelihood of observing enhancements partly depends on upstream solar wind conditions, with low proton gyroradius and low β particularly favored. Low Mach numbers, implying a larger shock standoff distance, are also favored for observations which suggest shock-like behavior., The Dst index is predicted on the basis of the solar wind for the years 1995-2002 using an update of the previous Temerin and Li [2002] prediction model for Dst. The updated model is based on additional data from the years 2000-2002 corresponding to the maximum of the solar cycle and includes several large magnetic storms. For this 8-year period, the linear correlation between the model and the Dst index is 0.956, the prediction efficiency is 0.914, and the RMS error of the prediction is 6.65 nT (nanoTesla). An analysis of some of the error in the model indicates that at least 25% of the remaining error is due to the effect on the Dst index of a portion of the Sq ionospheric current system and that close to 99% of the variance of Dst index due to magnetospheric currents is predictable. An examination of 10-day intervals around the six largest magnetic storms for which there is good solar wind data shows prediction efficiencies between 0.93 and 0.98 and linear correlation coefficients between 0.96 and 0.99. It is suggested that the annual variation in the Dst index is mainly due to magnetopause and ring currents and the location of the magnetometer stations used to calculate the Dst index. The dependence of the model on the solar wind implies that magnetospheric activity depends on the solar wind approximately in proportion to the square root of the density, square of the velocity, and linearly with the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). In addition, there is strong dependence on the direction of IMF such that magnetic activity depends approximately on the sixth power of the sine of half the IMF clock angle, where the IMF clock angle is angle of the IMF in the plane perpendicular to the solar wind velocity measured from the northward direction. The model has also strong dependence on the angle between the dipole axis and the solar wind velocity which explains, in part, the seasonal dependence of magnetospheric activity. Overall, the updated model further demonstrates that the large-scale currents that affect the Dst index are well controlled by solar wind variations., This study examines how the asymmetry in the low-latitude geomagnetic field evolves during sheath and magnetic cloud domains of interplanetary coronal mass ejections using the Dst, SYMH and ASYH indices. For all investigated storms the station that contributed most to Dst was located in the dusk sector while the smallest disturbance field was concentrated around dawn. We found that sheath region storms are associated with larger morning/afternoon asymmetry than magnetic cloud storms. For sheath storms the station in the dusk sector contributed almost four times as much to Dst as the station in the dawn sector. Furthermore, the disturbance field is strongly variable during sheath storms. The results of this study suggest that for magnetic cloud storms the asymmetry arises mainly from ions drifting on open trajectories whereas in a case of a sheath driven storm the sudden intensifications of the substorm associated current systems add significantly to the asymmetry., We have surveyed field-aligned electrons at the lobe/plasma sheet boundary and their association with reconnection in the distant magnetotail where reconnection is quasi-steady and large scale. Asymmetric (in energy) counterstreaming electrons are detected in ~30% of the boundary crossings when high-speed flows are present in the plasma sheet. In 98% of the electron beam cases the low-energy electrons are directed toward and the higher-energy electrons directed away from the X-line. The well-organized (by the signs of B<SUB>x</SUB> and V<SUB>x</SUB>) quadrupolar pattern of the electrons indicates that these electrons are associated with reconnection. The low-energy electrons could be the outer part of the Hall current loop, similar to previous reports in the near-Earth region. The mean electron energy in the distant tail is a factor of ten lower than in the near-Earth tail. Our observations suggest that the Hall effect can be detected even at large distances from the diffusion region., Distance redshift data can impose strong constraints on dark energy models even when the equation of state is oscillatory. Despite the double integral dependence of the distance on the equation of state, precision measurement of the distance redshift relation for z = 0 2 is more incisive than the linear growth factor, CMB last scattering surface distance, and the age of the universe in distinguishing oscillatory behavior from an average behavior. While oscillating models might help solve the coincidence problem (since acceleration occurs periodically), next generation observations will strongly constrain such possibilities., We use interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) analysis in eastern Taiwan to study reverse creep on the Longitudinal Valley fault (LVF). A stack of the three highest-quality image pairs spanning 1997-2000 shows sharp range change offsets along the eastern side of the Longitudinal Valley, suggesting 11-35 mm/yr of surface creep between 23 and 23.4°N. No shallow slip was observed along the northern or southern ends of the valley, nor on mapped fault traces on the western edge of the valley. The width of the zone of deformation varied, suggesting distributed shear in shallow sediments above the creeping fault in some places. The InSAR results support the view that although surface creep is rapid in certain locations, significant portions of the LVF are locked and thus represent a substantial seismic hazard., A mathematical model is presented that describes the effects of pore fluid aqueous diffusion and reaction rate on the isotopic exchange between fluids and rocks in reactive geo-hydrological systems where flow is primarily through fractures. The model describes a simple system with parallel equidistant fractures, and chemical transport in the matrix slabs between fractures by aqueous diffusion through a stagnant pore fluid. The solid matrix exchanges isotopes with pore fluid by solution-precipitation at a rate characterized by a time constant, R (yr <SUP>-1</SUP>), which is an adjustable parameter. The effects of reaction on the isotopes of a particular element in the fracture fluid are shown to depend on the ratio of the diffusive reaction length for that element ( L) to the fracture spacing ( b). The reaction length depends on the solid-fluid exchange rate within the matrix, the partitioning of the element between the matrix pore fluid and the matrix solid phase, the porosity and density of the matrix, and the aqueous diffusivity. For L/ b &lt; 0.3, fluid-rock isotopic exchange is effectively reduced by a factor of 2 L/ b relative to a standard porous flow (single porosity) model. For L/ b &gt; 1, the parallel fracture model is no different from a porous flow model. If isotopic data are available for two or more elements with different L values, it may be possible to use the model with appropriate isotopic measurements to estimate the spacing of the primary fluid-carrying fractures in natural fluid-rock systems. Examples are given using Sr and O isotopic data from mid-ocean ridge (MOR) hydrothermal vent fluids and Sr isotopes in groundwater aquifers hosted by fractured basalt. The available data for MOR systems are consistent with average fracture spacing of 1-4 m. The groundwater data suggest larger effective fracture spacing, in the range 50-500 m. In general, for fractured rock systems, the effects of fracture-matrix diffusive exchange must be considered when comparing isotopic exchange effects for different elements, as well as for estimating water age using radioactive and cosmogenic isotopes., We have discovered &gt;10<SUP>8</SUP> microbial cells/cm<SUP>3</SUP> attached to clay grains in the bottom 13 m of the GISP2 (Greenland Ice Sheet Project) ice core. Their concentration correlates with huge excesses of CO<SUB>2</SUB> and CH<SUB>4</SUB>. We show that Fe-reducing bacteria produce most of the excess CO<SUB>2</SUB> and methanogenic archaea produce the excess CH<SUB>4</SUB>. The number of attached cells per clay grain is proportional to grain perimeter rather than to area, which implies that nutrients are accessed at grain edges. We conclude that Fe-reducing microbes immobilized on clay surfaces metabolize via ""shuttle"" molecules that transport electrons to grain edges, where they reduce Fe(III) ions at edges to Fe(II) while organic acid ions are oxidized to CO<SUB>2</SUB>. Driven by the concentration gradient, electrons on Fe(II) ions at grain edges ""hop"" to Fe(III) ions inward in the same edges and oxidize them. The original Fe(III) ions can then attach new electrons from shuttle molecules at the edges. Our mechanism explains how Fe-reducers can reduce essentially all Fe(III) in clay minerals. We estimate that the Fe(III) in clay grains in the GISP2 silty ice can sustain Fe-reducing bacteria at the ambient temperature of -9°C for ~10<SUP>6</SUP> years. F <SUB>420</SUB> autofluorescence imaging shows that &gt;2.4% of the cells are methanogens, which account for the excess methane., This study presents the first measurement of <SUP>39</SUP>Ar recoil ejection loss from individual, dimensionally characterized mineral grains due to neutron irradiation, and reveals the extent to which this recoil loss is problematic for <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar dating. Using the well-characterized biotite standard GA1550, known to have between grain reproducibility of <SUP>40</SUP>Ar*/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar <SUB>K</SUB> of order 0.1%, we measured the thicknesses (3-210 μm) and surface areas (0.07-0.90 mm <SUP>2</SUP>) of 159 grains selected to span the dimensional range represented in the aliquot. Thinner grains with high surface area/volume (SA/V) reveal elevated <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar, as much as 26% higher than thicker grains expected to suffer proportionately negligible depletion. Although the thinner grains yield intrinsically less precise measurements due to small <SUP>39</SUP>Ar ion beams, a regular decrease in net recoil loss with increasing biotite grain thickness is clear for grains thinner than ca. 50 μm. Grains thicker than 50 μm reveal essentially no <SUP>39</SUP>Ar loss within analytical uncertainties. The measured <SUP>39</SUP>Ar loss spectrum is significantly higher than predicted by previous modeling approaches. These results suggest a practical threshold of ca. 50 μm grain thickness for biotites, and probably other phyllosilicates, irradiated with <SUP>235</SUP>U fission spectrum neutrons in order to avoid recoil artifacts. Poor agreement between our data and simulation results indicates that recoil displacement models should be revisited in order to resolve the discrepancy. Further empirical work to determine the recoil loss of <SUP>39</SUP>Ar in other minerals is important not only for routine age measurements, but also to shed more light on the role of recoil in multi-diffusion domain theory and other thermochronologic applications exploiting variable diffusion radii and/or grain size effects., In sudden flux increases at synchronous altitude the lower energy channels often show progressively more delay or dispersion. It is usually assumed that the dispersion is caused by a simultaneous injection of particles of all energies at some location, and by the subsequent drift of these particles to the synchronous altitude measurement site ``downstream'' of the injection event. In this paper we present a method for timing and locating the injections from proton auroral precipitation inferred by the Lyman α emission data from the IMAGE FUV instrument. We compare the timing of the proton flux increases observed by the Los Alamos National Laboratory synchronous altitude satellites to the time delay predicted by a model describing the longitudinal drift of particles in the magnetosphere. We present comparisons for eleven substorm particle injections and find that the observed azimuthal drift times are reasonably consistent with those calculated by a simple model using the Tsyganenko 89 magnetic and Volland electric field models as input. This consistency supports the concept that the proton auroral intensification at substorm onset and the proton injection in the magnetosphere occur at the same magnetic local time (longitude)., Multiwavelength observations of Galactic black hole transients during outburst decay are instrumental for our understanding of the accretion geometry and the formation of outflows around black hole systems. H1743-322, a black hole transient observed intensely in X-rays and also covered in the radio band during its 2003 decay, provides clues about the changes in accretion geometry during state transitions and also the general properties of X-ray emission during the intermediate and low-hard states. In this work, we report on the evolution of spectral and temporal properties in X-rays and the flux in the radio band, with the goal of understanding the nature of state transitions observed in this source. We concentrate on the transition from the thermal dominant state to the intermediate state that occurs on a timescale of 1 day. We show that the state transition is associated with a sudden increase in power-law flux. We determine that the ratio of the power-law flux to the overall flux in the 3-25 keV band must exceed 0.6 for us to observe strong timing noise. Even after the state transition, once this ratio was below 0.6, the system transited back to the thermal dominant state for 1 day. We show that the emission from the compact radio core does not turn on during the transition from the thermal dominant state to the intermediate state but does turn on when the source reaches the low-hard state, as seen in 4U 1543-47 and GX 339-4. We find that the photon index correlates strongly with the QPO frequency and anticorrelates with the rms amplitude of variability. We also show that the variability is more likely to be associated with the power-law emission than the disk emission., Iron is the most abundant redox-active metallic element on the earth's surface. Quinones, a term that encompasses dihydroxybenzenes (catechol and hydroquinone), semiquinone radicals, and benzoquinones, are abundant moieties within natural organic matter. Separately or in concert, iron species (both dissolved and precipitated) and quinones are believed to be key participants in a wide range of environmental redox reactions. Here, we investigate how pH, quinone structure, and iron speciation impose thermodynamic constraints on possible reactions. The steps outlined in this work must be followed to evaluate whether postulated redox processes involving iron and quinones are energetically feasible., Historical Type Ia supernovae are a leading candidate as the source of positrons observed through diffuse annihilation emission in the Galaxy. However, a search for annihilation emission from individual Type Ia supernovae was not possible before the improved sensitivity of INTEGRAL. The total 511 keV annihilation flux from individual SNe Ia, as well as their contribution to the overall diffuse emission, depends critically on the escape fraction of positrons produced in <SUP>56</SUP>Co decays. Late optical light curves suggest that this fraction may be as high as 5%. We have searched for positron annihilation radiation from the historical Type Ia supernova SN 1006 using the SPI instrument on INTEGRAL. We did not detect significant 511 keV line emission, with a 3 σ flux upper limit of 0.59 ×10<SUP>-4</SUP> photons cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> for ~1 Ms exposure time, assuming a FWHM of 2.5 keV. This upper limit corresponds to a 7.5% escape fraction, 50% higher than the expected 5% escape scenario, and rules out the possibility that Type Ia supernovae produce all of the positrons in the Galaxy (~12% escape fraction), if the mean positron lifetime is less than 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. Future observations with INTEGRAL will provide stronger limits on the escape fraction of positrons, the mean positron lifetime, and the contribution of Type Ia supernovae to the overall positron content of the Galaxy., We use a simplified version of the halo model with a power law power spectrum to study scale dependence in galaxy bias at the very large scales relevant to baryon oscillations. In addition to providing a useful pedagogical explanation of the scale dependence of galaxy bias, the model provides an analytic tool for studying how changes in the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) impact the scale dependence of galaxy bias on scales 10 &lt; k<SUP>-1</SUP> &lt; 1000 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc, which is useful for interpreting the results of complex N-body simulations. We find that changing the mean number of galaxies per halo of a given mass will change the scale dependence of the bias, but that changing the way the galaxies are distributed within the halo has a smaller effect on the scale dependence of bias at large scales. We use the model to explain the decay in amplitude of the baryon oscillations as k increases, and generalize the model to make predictions about scale dependent galaxy bias when redshift space distortions are introduced., The Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) is expected to make precise astrometric measurements that can be used to detect low-mass planets around nearby stars. Since most nearby stars are members of multiple-star systems, many of them will have a measurable acceleration due to their companion, which must be included when solving for astrometric parameters and searching for planetary perturbations. In addition, many of the stars with one radial velocity planet show indications of additional planets. Therefore, astrometric surveys such as SIM must be capable of detecting planets and measuring orbital parameters in systems with multiple stellar and/or planetary companions. We have conducted Monte Carlo simulations to investigate how the presence of multiple companions affects the sensitivity of an astrometric survey such as SIM. We find that the detection efficiency for planets in wide binary systems is relatively unaffected by the presence of a binary companion if the planetary orbital period is less than half the duration of the astrometric survey. For longer orbital periods, there are significant reductions in the sensitivity of an astrometric survey. In addition, we find that the signal required to detect a planet can be increased significantly due to the presence of an additional planet orbiting the same star. Fortunately, adding a modest number of precision radial velocity observations significantly improves the sensitivity for many multiple-planet systems. Thus, the combination of radial velocity observations and astrometric observations by SIM will be particularly valuable for studying multiple-planet systems., We survey the subject of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), emphasizing knowledge available prior to about 2003, as a synopsis of the phenomenology and its interpretation., We have used new and archival infrared and radio observations to search for a dwarf galaxy associated with the high-velocity cloud (HVC) known as `complex H.' Complex H is a large (Ω&gt;~400 deg<SUP>2</SUP>) and probably nearby (d=27 kpc) HVC whose location in the Galactic plane has hampered previous investigations of its stellar content. The H I mass of the cloud is 2.0×10<SUP>7</SUP>(d/27 kpc)<SUP>2</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>, making complex H one of the most massive HVCs if its distance is more than ~20 kpc. Virtually all similar H I clouds in other galaxy groups are associated with low surface brightness dwarf galaxies. We selected mid-infrared sources observed by the MSX satellite in the direction of complex H that appeared likely to be star-forming regions and observed them at the wavelength of the CO J=1--&gt;0 rotational transition in order to determine their velocities. Of the 60 observed sources, 59 show emission at Milky Way velocities, and we detected no emission at velocities consistent with that of complex H. We use these observations to set an upper limit on the ongoing star formation rate in the HVC of &lt;~5×10<SUP>-4</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. We also searched the 2MASS database for evidence of any dwarf-galaxy-like stellar population in the direction of the HVC and found no trace of a distant red giant population, with an upper limit on the stellar mass of ~10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>. Given the lack of evidence for either current star formation or an evolved population, we conclude that complex H cannot be a dwarf galaxy with properties similar to those of known dwarfs. Complex H is therefore one of the most massive known H I clouds that does not contain any stars. If complex H is self-gravitating, then this object is one of the few known dark galaxy candidates. These findings may offer observational support for the idea that the cold dark matter substructure problem is related to the difficulty of forming stars in low-mass dark matter halos; alternatively, complex H could be an example of a cold accretion flow onto the Milky Way., The structure of the dark energy equation of state phase plane holds important information on the nature of the physics. We explain the bounds of the freezing and thawing models of scalar field dark energy in terms of the tension between the steepness of the potential vs the Hubble drag. Additionally, we extend the phase plane structure to modified gravity theories, examine trajectories of models with certain properties, and categorize regions in terms of scalar field hierarchical parameters, showing that dark energy is generically not a slow roll phenomenon., We present the first high-resolution (R~31,000) spectra of the cool L subdwarf (sdL) 2MASS 0532+8246 and what was originally identified as an early-type sdL, LSR 1610-0040. Our work, in combination with contemporaneous work by Cushing and Vacca, makes it clear that the latter object is more likely a mid-M dwarf with an unusual composition that gives it some subdwarf spectral features. We use the data to derive precise radial velocities for both objects and to estimate space motion; both are consistent with halo kinematics. We measure the projected rotational velocities, revealing a very slow rotation for the old sd?M6 object LSR 1610-0040. The object 2MASS 0532+8246 exhibits a rapid rotation of vsini=65+/-15 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, consistent with the behavior of L dwarfs. This means that the braking time for L dwarfs is extremely long, or that perhaps they never slow down. A detailed comparison of the atomic Rb and Cs lines with spectra of field L dwarfs shows that the spectral type 2MASS 0532+8246 is consistent with being mid- to late-L. The Rb I and K I lines of LSR 1610-0040 are like those of an early-L dwarf, but the Cs I line is like that of a mid-M dwarf. The appearance of the Ca II triplet in absorption in this object is very hard to understand if it is not at least as warm as M6. We explain these effects in a consistent way using a mildly metal-poor mid-M model. M subdwarfs have weak metal oxides and enhanced metal hydrides relative to normal M dwarfs. LSR 1610-0040 exhibits metal hydrides like an M dwarf but metal oxides like a subdwarf. The same explanation that resolves the atomic-line discrepancy explains this as well. Our spectra cover the spectral region around a previously unidentified absorption feature at 9600 Å and the region around 9400 Å in which detection of TiH has been claimed. We identify the absorption around 9600 Å as being due to atomic lines of Ti and a small contribution of FeH, but we cannot confirm a detection of TiH in the spectra of cool sdLs. In 2MASS 0532+8246, both metal oxides and metal hydrides are extremely strong relative to normal L dwarfs. It may be possible to explain the strong oxide features in 2MASS 0532+8246 by invoking effects due to inhibited dust formation. High-resolution spectroscopy has aided in beginning to understand the complex molecular chemistry and spectral formation in metal-deficient and ultracool atmospheres and the properties of early ultra-low-mass objects., Using observations from the FAST small explorer spacecraft, we present fields and plasma observations above the dayside auroral oval showing the erosion of ionospheric plasmas from the topside ionosphere by the action of Alfvén waves. Using interferometric techniques, the waves are shown to approximately obey the expected dispersion for Alfvén waves with transverse scales extending from greater than electron inertial lengths down to ion gyroradii. Measurements of the plasma density where these waves are observed show that over latitudinal widths exceeding 100 km total depletion of the cold ionospheric plasma can occur. These depleted regions or cavities are populated by magnetosheath plasmas, upgoing transversely accelerated ionospheric ions, and downgoing field-aligned electrons. The ionospheric ions and field-aligned electrons are distributed as conics and beams, respectively. Poynting flux observations on the density gradients comprising the cavity walls show that these waves are directed downward and focused inward toward regions of lower density. Wave phase velocity measurements, while subject to significant uncertainty, show that the wave vector is directed transversely outward from the cavity. These observations suggest a feedback model for Alfvén wave focusing and ion heating on density gradients that can lead to intense ion outflow from the ionosphere and subsequent depletion of ionospheric plasmas., The Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) instrument includes a ""white light"" imaging capability with novel characteristics. Many flares with such white-light emission have been detected, and this paper provides an introductory overview of these data. These observations have 0.5″ pixel size and use the full broad-band response of the CCD sensor; the images are not compromised by ground-based seeing and have excellent pointing stability as well as high time resolution. The spectral response of the TRACE white-light passband extends into the UV, so these data capture, for the first time in images, the main radiative energy of a flare. This initial survey is based on a sample of flares observed at high time resolution for which the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) had complete data coverage, a total of 11 events up to the end of 2004. We characterize these events in terms of source morphology and contrast against the photosphere. We confirm the strong association of the TRACE white-light emissions - which include UV as well as visual wavelengths - with hard X-ray sources observed by RHESSI. The images show fine structure at the TRACE resolution limit, and often show this fine structure to be extended over large areas rather than just in simple footpoint sources. The white-light emission shows strong intermittency both in space and in time and commonly contains features unresolved at the TRACE resolution. We detect white-light continuum emission in flares as weak as GOES C1.6. limited by photon statistics and background solar fluctuations, and support the conclusion of Neidig (1989) that white-light continuum occurs in essentially all flares., The localization of the short-duration, hard-spectrum gamma-ray burst GRB 050509b by the Swift satellite was a watershed event. We report the discovery of the probable host galaxy, a bright elliptical galaxy at z=0.2248. This is the first known redshift and host of a short-hard GRB and shows that at least some short-hard GRBs are cosmological in origin. We began imaging the GRB field 8 minutes after the burst and continued for 8 days. We present a reanalysis of the XRT afterglow and report the absolute position of the GRB. Based on positional coincidences, the GRB and the elliptical are likely to be physically related, unlike any known connection between a long-duration GRB and an early-type galaxy. Similarly unique, GRB 050509b likely also originated from within a rich cluster of galaxies with detectable diffuse X-ray emission. We demonstrate that while the burst was underluminous, the ratio of the blast wave energy to the γ-ray energy is consistent with that of long-duration GRBs. Based on this analysis, on the location of the GRB (40+/-13 kpc from the putative host), on the galaxy type (elliptical), and the lack of a coincident supernova, we suggest that there is now observational support for the hypothesis that short-hard bursts arise during the merger of a compact binary. We limit the properties of any Li-Paczyński ``minisupernova'' that is predicted to arise on ~1 day timescales. Other progenitor models are still viable, and new Swift bursts will undoubtedly help to further clarify the progenitor picture., Two classes of natural solid media, glacial ice and salt domes, are under consideration as media in which to deploy instruments for detection of neutrinos with energy ≥10<SUP>18</SUP> eV. Though insensitive to 10<SUP>11</SUP> to 10<SUP>16</SUP> eV neutrinos for which observatories (e.g., AMANDA and IceCube) that utilize optical Cherenkov radiation detectors are designed, radio and acoustic methods are suited for searches for the very low fluxes of neutrinos with energies &gt;10<SUP>17</SUP> eV. This is because owing to the very long attenuation lengths of radio and acoustic waves produced by interactions of such neutrinos in ice and salt, detection modules can be spaced at horizontal distances ∼1 km, in contrast to the 0.12 km distances between strings of IceCube modules. In this paper, I calculate the absorption and scattering coefficients as a function of frequency and grain size for acoustic waves in glacial ice and salt domes and show that experimental measurements on laboratory samples and in glacial ice and salt domes are consistent with theory. For South Pole ice with grain size ∼0.2 cm at depths ≤600 m, scattering lengths are calculated to be 2000 and 25 km at frequencies 10 and 30 kHz, respectively; for grain size ∼0.4 cm at 1500 m (the maximum depth to be instrumented acoustically), scattering lengths are calculated to be 250 and 3 km. These are within the range of frequencies where most of the energy of the acoustic wave is concentrated. The absorption length is calculated to be 9 ± 3 km at all frequencies above ∼100 Hz. For NaCl (rock salt) with grain size 0.75 cm, scattering lengths are calculated to be 120 and 1.4 km at 10 and 30 kHz, and absorption lengths are calculated to be 3 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> and 3300 km at 10 and 30 kHz. Existing measurements are consistent with theory. For ice, absorption is the limiting factor; for salt, scattering is the limiting factor. Both media would be suitable for detection of acoustic waves from ultrahigh-energy neutrino interactions., We investigate the injection at the Sun for three scatter-free impulsive electron events (7 August 1999, 28 June and 22 August 2000) observed from ~0.4 to 300 keV by the WIND 3DP instrument. Taking into account the interplanetary scatter-free propagation and instrumental effects, we find that the observed time profiles of electron fluxes at all energies fit well to triangular injections at the Sun with equal rise and fall times. We find two distinct injections: that of ~0.4 to 6-9 keV electrons begins 9.1 +/- 4.7 min before the start of the type III radio burst and lasts for 50-300 min, while that of ~13 to 300 keV electrons starts 7.6 +/- 1.3 min after the start of the type III burst and lasts for a factor of 5-10 times shorter. Electrons of the low-energy injection are likely to be the source of the type III radio bursts, and the delayed high-energy injection occurs when the associated CME passes altitudes of ~1-6 R<SUB>$\odot$</SUB>. The observed electron energy spectra fit to double power-law with a downward break at ~40-50 keV, but exhibit a smooth power-law across the transition (~6-13 keV) between the two injections, suggesting the low-energy injection may provide the seed electrons for the high-energy injection., We study the clustering properties of groups and of galaxies in groups in the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey data set at z~1 in three separate fields covering a total of 2 deg<SUP>2</SUP>. Four measures of two-point clustering in the DEEP2 data are presented: (1) the group correlation function for 460 groups with estimated velocity dispersions of σ&gt;=200 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> (2) the galaxy correlation for the full DEEP2 galaxy sample, using a flux-limited sample of 9800 objects in the range 0.7&lt;=z&lt;=1.0 (3) the galaxy correlation for galaxies in groups or in the field; and (4) the group-galaxy cross-correlation function. Our results are compared with mock group and galaxy catalogs produced from ΛCDM simulations. Using the observed number density and clustering amplitude of the DEEP2 groups, the estimated minimum group dark matter halo mass is M<SUB>min</SUB>~6×10<SUP>12</SUP> h<SUP>-1</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>. Groups are more clustered than galaxies in the DEEP2 data, with a relative bias of b=1.17+/-0.04 on scales r<SUB>p</SUB>=0.5-15 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc. The correlation function of galaxies in groups has a steeper slope (γ~2.12+/-0.06) than for the full galaxy sample (γ~1.74+/-0.03), and both samples can be fit by a power law on scales r<SUB>p</SUB>=0.05-20 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc. We empirically measure the contribution to the projected correlation function, w<SUB>p</SUB>(r<SUB>p</SUB>), for galaxies in groups from a ``one-halo'' term and a ``two-halo'' term. The projected cross-correlation between group centers and the full galaxy sample shows that red galaxies are more centrally concentrated in groups than blue galaxies at z~1. DEEP2 galaxies in groups appear to have a shallower radial distribution than that of mock galaxy catalogs made from N-body simulations, which assume a central galaxy surrounded by satellite galaxies with an NFW profile. Using simulations with different halo model parameters, we show that the clustering of galaxies in groups can be used to place tighter constraints on the halo model than can be gained from using the usual galaxy correlation function alone., We request three nights of gray time on the MMT red channel spectrograph to search for companion quasars around the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) high redshift (z &gt; 3) quasar sample. Our quasar pair selection technique has been tremendously successful at finding low redshift quasar pairs (0.7 &lt; z &lt; 3.0), allowing us to make the first measurement of the quasar correlation function on scales 10 hkpc &lt; R &lt; 1 hmpc. With three nights at the MMT, we will be able to make a similar measurement at z &gt; 3. Our group has discovered the only two known sub-arcminute binary quasars at z &gt; 4, and the existence of these objects provides circumstantial evidence that quasars cluster much more strongly that galaxies at high redshift. Our MMT observations will put this speculation on solid statistical footing. A by product of our proposed observations, is that we will also discover several physically unassociated projected pairs of high redshift quasars, which will provide new extremely rare sightlines which cna be used to characterize the transverse proximity effect at high redshifts., We have obtained high S/N moderate and high resolution Gemini and Keck spectra of the Ly(alpha) forests of a large sample of projected pairs of quasars with z&gt; 2 and sub-arcminute separations. In these extremely rare sightlines, Ly(alpha) absorption, as measured in the background quasar spectrum, can be used to study the environment, emission geometry, and radiative history of the foreground quasar, provided that the systemic redshift of the foreground quasar is known accurately. We propose to obtain low dispersion (R 1700) H- band spectra of 24 sub-arcminute z &gt; 2 projected pairs of quasars, with NIRI and GNIRS to determine systemic redshifts from the narrow [OIII] (lambda) 5008 emission line accurate to &lt; 100km s^-1. This will eliminate the current 5 hmpc uncertainty in the foreground quasars' radial position, resolving transverse length scales as small as 25hkpc. We will then be able to characterize the transverse proximity effect, measure the cross-correlation function of quasars with neutral gas, constrain the isotropy of quasar emission, and the emission history of the quasars on timescales from 8 × 10^4 to 3 × 10^6 years, as well as gain insights into the fluorescent recombination radiation emitted by Lyman limit systems illuminated by ultraviolet photons., Chemical weathering rates for landscapes are difficult to quantify because the timescales over which weathering occurs are often unknown. In this study, we use timescales defined by prior cosmogenic nuclide analyses and a suite of geochemical measurements to calculate weathering rates in saprolite and soil and to determine how these rates vary across an eroding hillslope. We also estimate the relative contributions of solute and erosional mass loss to landscape lowering. Analyses were conducted on a soil-mantled hillslope developed on a granodiorite pluton in southern NSW, Australia. Mass loss in solution accounts for 35% to 55% of the total mass loss from the hillslope. Saprolite close to the soil-saprolite boundary is less weathered at the ridge than at distance from the ridge. The calculated flux of silica from the saprolite is 5 tons km <SUP>- 2 </SUP> yr <SUP>- 1 </SUP> and does not vary with distance from the ridge or overlying soil thickness. The assumption of steady state, but spatially variable erosion rates with a temporally constant thickness of soil and saprolite allows us to calculate the downslope variation in the rate of solute losses. Soil silica weathering rates initially increase from ∼12 tons km <SUP>- 2 </SUP> yr <SUP>- 1 </SUP> at the ridge crest to ∼20 tons km <SUP>- 2 </SUP> yr <SUP>- 1 </SUP> on the convex region of the hillslope, and then decrease to 13 tons km <SUP>- 2 </SUP> yr <SUP>- 1 </SUP> by the time soils have been transported 45-50 m. Soils closer to the surface are more weathered than deeper soils. This geochemical stratification suggests that the soil column does not become thoroughly vertically mixed as soils move down slope. Dependence of solute loss on transport distance may explain the previously noted discrepancy between the observed soil thickness and that predicted based on curvature. Variation of solute loss with transport distance may also contribute to the linear dependence of soil thickness on distance from the ridge., I investigate the processes at work in the cancellation of normal magnetic flux in solar magnetograms and study the relationships between cancellation and the budget of free magnetic energy in the coronal magnetic field that can power solar flares and CMEs. After defining cancellation mathematically, I derive equations that quantify the evolution of free magnetic energy in response to arbitrary plasma flows on the boundary, including flows consistent with cancellation. While cancellation can reduce the magnetic energy in both the actual coronal field and the potential field matching the same normal field boundary condition, cancellation can, in the process, increase the difference between the two; i.e., cancellation can increase the free magnetic energy in the corona. By making simple assumptions based upon typical observed field configurations in filament channels, I show that cancellation tends to add free energy to these fields. Finally, I discuss the implications of this fact, as well as wider applications of the free energy flux formalism developed here. I also briefly address related issues, including the relationship of cancellation to Taylor's hypothesis., We have performed the first polarimetry of solar flare emission at γ-ray energies (0.2-1 MeV). These observations were performed with the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) for two large flares: the GOES X4.8-class solar flare of 2002 July 23 and the X17-class flare of 2003 October 28. We have marginal polarization detections in both flares, at levels of 21%+/-9% and -11%+/-5%, respectively. These measurements significantly constrain the levels and directions of solar flare γ-ray polarization and begin to probe the underlying electron distributions., We propose to use the high angular resolution provided by NIRI/ALTAIR to follow-up the orbits of binary main-belt systems already discovered (121 Hermione, 130 Elektra, 379 Huenna, 762 Pulcova, 1509 Esclangona) to improve their orbital elements. Determination of the precise orbital elements of the secondary can be done by multiple observations spanning large periods of time (on several years). Our group developed two independent visual methods to separate the geometrical orbit determination from the dynamical one including secular variations of the orbital plane and the pericenter. Without any assumptions, they led to the determination of the main orbital elements (a, P, e, i) of binary systems (see Marchis et al., 2004, 2005bcd). Additional observations will allow to detect unambiguously the precession of their orbit and constrain the distribution of mass in their interior (density, mass, porosity) giving direct insights on their formation processes. The recent discovery of two moonlets orbiting 87 Sylvia (Marchis et al.,2005e) indicates that multiple systems exist and should be discovered with large AO campaign., This thesis presents several studies of molecular gas in nearby dwarf irregular galaxies. These galaxies harbor environments distinct from those found in large spiral galaxies like the Milky Way. They therefore offer an opportunity to study the effect of environment on star formation. This thesis has four main parts: a survey studying how molecular gas content relates to other galaxy parameters; case studies of two very nearby dwarf galaxies, IC 10 and the SMC; and a detailed look at the methodology used to measure properties of giant molecular clouds (GMCs). <P />We searched nearby dwarf galaxies for CO emission, the most commonly used tracer of molecular gas. We increase the number of dwarfs with measured CO emission by 50% and find very little variation in the normalized CO content of a galaxy with mass down to about the mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Further, the molecular gas in dwarfs forms stars at about the same rate as molecular gas in large galaxies, as measured by the ratio of radio continuum emission to CO emission. <P />Local Group dwarf galaxies show much lower normalized CO contents than large spiral galaxies or the dwarfs that we detect. Selection effects may skew the results of these surveys towards dwarf starbursts. We conduct detailed case studies of two of the Local Group irregulars: (1) we map the entire CO content of IC 10, the nearest dwarf starburst galaxy, with the resolution to distinguish individual GMCs: and (2) we use data from the Spitzer Survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud to study the dust and molecular gas in the nearest low metallicity galaxy, the Small Magellanic Cloud. Studying the CO, we find little variation between the properties of GMCs in dwarf galaxies and those in large spirals. However, using the dust as a tracer of the molecular gas in the SMC, we find substantially more H 2 than we would predict from CO. In dwarf galaxies stars may form out of an environment similar to Galactic GMCs, the CO emitting regions, but there may be an abundance of CO-free H 2 beyond these cores., In 2005 May-June, the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) observed the Be/X-ray binary system A0535+26 during a giant outburst, during which time its hard X-ray intensity reached several crab. This bright source presented a unique opportunity to search for redshifted neutron-capture lines from the surface of the neutron star. Such lines, if discovered, would strongly constrain the neutron star equation of state, motivating this search. An upper limit on the narrow, unredshifted line has been set at 6.5×10<SUP>-4</SUP> photons cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP>, while width-dependent limits on a broadened, redshifted line are set in the range of (4.0-10.5)×10<SUP>-4</SUP> photons cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP>. To our knowledge, these are the first measured upper limits on redshifted 2.2 MeV emission from an accreting neutron star., We present Keck Interferometer observations of TW Hya that spatially resolve its emission at 2 μm wavelength. Analyzing these data together with existing K-band veiling and near-infrared photometric measurements, we conclude that the inner disk consists of optically thin, submicron-sized dust extending from ~4 AU to within 0.06 AU of the central star. The inner disk edge may be magnetospherically truncated. Even if we account for the presence of gas in the inner disk, these small dust grains have survival times against radiation blowout that are orders of magnitude shorter than the age of the system, suggesting continual replenishment through collisions of larger bodies., Many of the known extrasolar planets are ``hot Jupiters,'' giant planets with orbital periods of just a few days. We use the observed distribution of hot Jupiters to constrain the location of its inner edge in the mass-period diagram. If we assume a slope corresponding to the classical Roche limit, then we find that the edge corresponds to a separation close to twice the Roche limit, as expected if the planets started on highly eccentric orbits that were later circularized. In contrast, any migration scenario would predict an inner edge right at the Roche limit, which applies to planets approaching on nearly circular orbits. However, the current sample of hot Jupiters is not sufficient to provide a precise constraint simultaneously on both the location and the slope of the inner edge., We present results of optical follow-up observations of candidate ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). Using Keck optical spectroscopy, 17 of the candidates from the Colbert and Ptak [Colbert, E.J.M., Ptak, A.F. A catalog of candidate intermediate-luminosity X-ray objects. ApJS 143, 25-45, 2002] catalog have been identified; this is one of the largest sets of optical identifications of such objects thus far. Fifteen are background active galactic nuclei (AGN); two are foreground stars in our Galaxy. These findings are consistent with background and foreground object expectations, as derived from log N-log S relations. Also, the results are briefly discussed in terms of the spiral-galaxy/ULX connection., This thesis is devoted to the expansion of the technique of electron reflectometry from its prior purpose in mapping lunar crustal magnetic fields to the same purpose at Mars, where the presence of a substantial atmosphere considerably complicates matters. <P />Previous work, using magnetometer data from the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft, established the existence of surprisingly strong crustal remanent magnetic fields and placed important constraints both upon the properties of the crustal magnetic sources responsible for the fields and upon the timing and orientation of Mars's ancient core dynamo. <P />To build upon this work, I have analyzed pitch angle distributions of magnetically reflecting solar wind electrons measured by the MGS Magnetometer/ Electron Reflectometer (MAG/ER) to create a map of Martian crustal magnetic fields at ~195 km altitude, giving greater spatial resolution and sensitivity than was previously possible using magnetometer data alone. <P />Low magnetic fields measured above most volcanoes indicate thermal demagnetization of the crust by magmatism and underplating after the cessation of the core dynamo, while relatively high fields measured above the Hadriaca Patera volcano imply that Martian volcanism predates this cessation and is significantly older than any exposed volcanic surface. <P />The geographic and size distribution of demagnetization signatures of impact craters and the suggested presence of magnetic edge effects, indicates that (1) crustal magnetization occurs at typically shallower depths in the northern Martian lowlands than in the southern highlands and (2) the typical crustal magnetic coherence scale, is &gt;100 km. <P />A comparison of crater retention ages with magnetic signatures of some of the oldest impact basins on Mars confirms that Mars's core dynamo ceased operating early in the planet's history, &gt;4 billion years ago. Significant differences in magnetization between geologically contemporary basins suggests that the dynamo's final weakening and death may have taken place over as little as 10-30 million years. <P />An unintended benefit of this analysis has been a modification of the ER technique to produce measurements of mass densities in the Martian upper thermosphere (~200 km), which show that variations in extreme ultraviolet flux likely affect interannual variability of these densities, particularly near aphelion and that the effects of global lower atmospheric dust storms do not appear to propagate to these altitudes., We present high quality images of the uranian ring system, obtained in August 2002, October 2003, and July 2004 at 2.2 μm with the adaptive optics camera NIRC2 on the Keck II telescope. Using these data, we report the first detection in backscattered light of a ring (which we refer to as the ζ ring) interior to Uranus' known rings. This ring consists of a generally uniform sheet of dust between 37,850 and 41,350 km with an equivalent width EW=250±20m (in 2004; or μEW≈50m), and extends inward to 32,600 km at a gradually decreasing brightness. This ring might be related to the Voyager ring R/1986 U 2, although both its location and extent differ. This could be attributed to a difference in observing wavelength and/or solar phase angle, or perhaps to temporal variations in the ring. Through careful modeling of the I/F of the individual rings at each ansa, we reveal the presence of narrow (few 100 km wide) sheets of dust between the δ and ɛ rings, and between rings 4 and α. We derived a typical anisotropy factor g≈0.7 in the scattering behavior of these particles. The spatial distribution and relative intensity of these dust sheets is different than that seen in Voyager images taken in forward scattered light, due either to a difference in observing wavelength, and/or solar phase angle or to changes over time. We may have detected the λ ring in one scan at μEW≈15m, but other scans provided upper limits below this value. A single detection, however, would be consistent with azimuthal asymmetries known to exist in this ring. We further demonstrate the presence of azimuthal asymmetries in all rings. We confirm the eccentricity of ∼0.001 in rings 4, 5, 6, which in 2004 are ∼70 km closer to Uranus in the north (near periapse; lower I/F) than in the south. We find a global optical depth of τ∼0.3 in the main rings, and of τ=0.25±0.05 in the ɛ ring., Anisotropy in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) encodes a wealth of information about the early universe. Measurements of the power spectra of CMB anisotropy currently support an inflationary universe with cold dark matter and a flat geometry, and this model is now the standard model of cosmology. <P />MAXIPOL is the polarization-sensitive extension of the successful balloon-borne MAXIMA instrument that measured the power spectrum of the CMB temperature anisotropy. MAXIPOL is designed to measure the CMB E polarization power spectrum between spherical multipoles of 300 &lt; l &lt; 1000 using a continuously rotating half wave plate (HWP) and an array of 12 140 GHz bolometers. MAXIPOL employs 4 410 GHz bolometers for the characterization of polarized dust foregrounds. <P />This thesis describes the experimental work done to enhance the MAXIMA instrument for polarization observations, and it describes the analysis of data from the successful May 24, 2003 flight of MAXIPOL. <P />The MAXIPOL data is shown to be free of systematic errors, including any HWP- synchronous systematics, to the level of 150 m K 2 in the polarization power spectra E and B. An upper limit is set on the CMB E spectrum of 25 m K 2 in the band from 0 &lt; l &lt; 232 and 356 m K 2 in the band from 233 &lt; l &lt; 694. An upper limit on the dust polarized intensity in the Polaris region is set at 300% of the intensity extrapolated from the IRAS 100 mm map. <P />The upper limits on E and polarized dust do not further constrain the standard cosmological model or the standard dust foreground model. However, the successful implementation of the HWP technique free of systematic errors is an important precedent for future B spectrum experiments., This thesis presents the development of a sensitive near-infrared differential imaging polarimeter, and its subsequent use, combined with mid infrared imaging, to survey circumstellar dust around 110 Herbig Ae/Be stars. Planets are born in dusty circumstellar disks around young stars. By imaging such disks we can learn about the environment and physical processes that assemble planets from primordial dust and gas. But these observations are challenging on account of the high angular resolution and high dynamic range necessary to detect the disk's faint reflected light against a far brighter background of stellar light. One powerful method for obtaining the necessary contrast is the use of differential polarimetry to separate polarized dust-scattered light from unpolarized starlight. For this reason, I have developed a differential polarimetry mode for IRCAL, the adaptive optics science camera at Lick Observatory, which uses a YLF Wollaston prism beamsplitter to attenuate 98-99% of stellar light. I describe this instrument, summarize the data reduction and image analysis algorithms employed, and discuss lessons learned for future high-contrast imaging systems. A second strategy for high contrast science is to obtain observations at mid-infrared wavelengths, where dust is bright and stellar light is comparatively faint. These two techniques are complementary, respectively probing scattered and thermal light, and their multiwavelength combination can help constrain numerical models of circumstellar disks and envelopes. I have obtained near-IR adaptive optics imaging polarimetry and mid-IR imaging of a large sample of Herbig Ae/Be stars; 110 targets were observed with AO polarimetry and 61 with mid-IR imaging. Of these stars, 40 are found to have extended polarized nebulosity arising from scattered light. The dust geometry is highly variable, ranging from circumstellar disks to envelopes split by bipolar outflow cavities to complex arcs and lanes of dust spiraling around and between stars. I present detailed studies of a subset of these objects, including laser guide star AO observations of disks and envelopes around the stars LkHalpha 198 and LkHalpha 233; the discovery of the first resolved edge-on circumstellar disk around a Herbig Ae/Be star, PDS 144 N; and integral field spectroscopy of a narrowly collimated bipolar outflow from LkHalpha 233. I conclude by discussing future prospects for advances in the studies of circumstellar disks with the coming generation of high contrast instruments., We describe the design, development, and demonstration of a frequency-domain multiplexed readout technology for superconducting transition-edge sensors (TESs). This technology enables us to deploy large-scale bolometer arrays for ultra-sensitive observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). <P />Each sensor is biased with a sinusoidal voltage at a unique frequency. As the sensor impedance changes due to absorbed radiation, it amplitude-modulates its bias. The modulated sensor currents are summed and measured with a single superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) array. The 100-element SQUID array is operated with custom shunt feedback electronics that have a bandwidth of 1MHz and a slew rate of 1.2 × 10 7 F 0 /s. Separate warm demodulation electronics recover the sky signal from each sensor. <P />Our eight-channel demonstration of readout multiplexing showed a multiplexer readout noise of &lt; 7 pA/[Special characters omitted.] (as referred to the input of the SQUID), well below the sensor noise of 15 pA/[Special characters omitted.] . Crosstalk between multiplexed channels is well below our design limit of 1% and demodulated noise spectra from multiplexed sensors show the expected sensor noise levels and are white at frequencies down to 200 mHz. <P />The current frequency-domain multiplexing technology will be used on several experiments designed to observe the CMB: APEX-SZ, the South Pole Telescope, Polarbear, and EBEX. Extensions to the technology are described that will enhance the performance of the system and allow multiplexing of ~ 10 2 detectors., We present an analysis of the rotation measures (RMs) of polarized extragalactic point sources in the Southern Galactic Plane Survey. This work demonstrates that the statistics of fluctuations in RM differ for the spiral arms and the interarm regions. Structure functions of RM are flat in the spiral arms, while they increase in the interarms. This indicates that there are no correlated RM fluctuations in the magnetoionized interstellar medium in the spiral arms on scales larger than ~0.5d, corresponding to ~17 pc in the nearest spiral arm probed. The nonzero slopes in interarm regions imply a much larger scale of RM fluctuations. We conclude that fluctuations in the magnetoionic medium in the Milky Way spiral arms are not dominated by the mainly supernova-driven turbulent cascade in the global ISM but are probably due to a different source, most likely H II regions., The Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) on board Swift has the capability to provide critical insight into the physics of the early afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). But without precise calibration of the UVOT to standard photometric systems, it is impossible to leverage late-time, ground-based follow-up data to the early-time UVOT observations. In this paper, we present a calibration of the Swift UVOT photometry to the standard Johnson UBV system for the UVOT U, B, and V filters, and a step-by-step photometry recipe for analyzing these data. We base our analysis on aperture photometry performed on the ground-based and UVOT observations of the local standard stars in the fields of supernovae (SNe) 2005am and 2005cf and a number of Landolt standard stars. We find that the optimal photometry aperture radius for UVOT data is small (2.5"" for unbinned data, 3.0"" for 2×2 binned data), and we show that the coincidence-loss (C-loss) correction is important even for relatively faint magnitudes (16-19 mag). Based on a theoretically motivated model, we fit the C-loss correction with two parameters, the photometric zero point (ZP) and the saturation magnitude (m<SUB>∞</SUB>), and derive tight constraints for both parameters [σ(ZP)=0.01 mag and σ(m<SUB>∞</SUB>)=0.02 mag)]. We find that the color-term correction is not necessary for the UVOT B and V filters but that it is necessary for the U filter for blue objects [(U-V)&lt;0.4 mag]. We analyze the UVOT UBV photometry of SN 2005am and find that the UVOT photometry is generally consistent with the ground-based observations but that a difference of up to 0.5 mag is found when the SN became faint. We also apply our calibration results to the UVOT observations of GRB 050603. There is a scatter of ~0.04-0.08 mag in our final UVOT photometry, the cause of which is unclear, but it may be partly due to the spatial variation in the pixel sensitivity of the UVOT detector., Mid-infrared observations of IK Tau have been made at 11.15 μm with the three-telescope Infrared Spatial Interferometer on Mount Wilson and also using individual segments of the Keck telescope for multiple-aperture interferometry on the Keck telescope at 10.7 μm. Both experiments provided closure phase and show temporal variations and asymmetries in the surrounding dust, with a difference of about 15% in intensity between two sides of the star. Asymmetries have been previously observed in the distribution of SiO masers closely surrounding the star. Comparison with earlier interferometric measurements shows substantial reduction in dust surrounding the star over the last decade. Several asymmetric dust models are investigated and simple images constructed., We have performed one-dimensional full particle simulations of perpendicular shocks and found that an electron cyclotron microinstability can develop in the foot during the self-reformation phase of low β<SUB>i</SUB> supercritical shocks. The instability is excited by the beam of reflected ions interacting with the incoming electrons. It exhibits a rapid growth, and propagates along the shock normal towards upstream. This instability, which does not require high Mach number, has a frequency comparable to the electron cyclotron frequency and a wavelength shorter than the electron inertia length. It basically results from the coupling of electron Bernstein waves with an ion beam mode carried by the reflected ions. Dispersion properties in the foot are analysed. We discuss the effects of varying parameters, in particular as the fake ion-to-electron mass ratio used in the simulations converges to more realistic values. Comparison with other microinstabilities evidenced in recent full particle simulations of shocks is outlined., To date, 10 stars are known which harbor two or three planets. These systems reveal secular and mean motion resonances in some systems and consist of widely separated, eccentric orbits in others. Both of the triple planet systems, namely Upsilon And and 55 Cancri, exhibit evidence of resonances. The two planets orbiting GJ 876 exhibit both mean-motion and secular resonances and they perturb each other so strongly that the evolution of the orbits is revealed in the Doppler measurements. The common occurrence of resonances suggests that delicate dynamical processes often shape the architecture of planetary systems. Likely processes include planet migration in a viscous disk, eccentricity pumping by the planet-disk interaction, and resonance capture of two planets. We find a class of ""hierarchical"" double-planet systems characterized by two planets in widely separated orbits, defined to have orbital period ratios greater than 5 to 1. In such systems, resonant interactions are weak, leaving high-order interactions and Kozai resonances plausibly important. We compare the planets that are single with those in multiple systems. We find that neither the two mass distributions nor the two eccentricity distributions are significantly different. This similarity in single and multiple systems suggests that similar dynamical processes may operate in both. The origin of eccentricities may stem from a multi-planet past or from interactions between planets and disk. Multiple planets in resonances can pump their eccentricities pumping resulting in one planet being ejected from the system or sent into the star, leaving a (more massive) single planet in an eccentric orbit. The distribution of semimajor axes of all known extrasolar planets shows a rise toward larger orbits, portending a population of gas-giant planets that reside beyond 3 AU, arguably in less perturbed, more circular orbits., Disks represent a crucial stage in the formation of stars and planets. They are novel astrophysical systems with attributes intermediate between the interstellar medium and stars. Their physical properties are inhomogeneous and are affected by hard stellar radiation and by dynamical evolution. Observing disk structure is difficult because of the small sizes, ranging from as little as 0.05 AU at the inner edge to 100-1000 AU at large radial distances. Nonetheless, substantial progress has been made by observing the radiation emitted by the dust from near infrared to mm wavelengths, i.e., the spectral energy distribution of an unresolved disk. Many fewer results are available for the gas, which is the main mass component of disks over much of their lifetime. The inner disk gas of young stellar objects (henceforth YSOs) have been studied using the near infrared rovibrational transitions of CO and a few other molecules, while the outer regions have been explored with the mm and sub-mm lines of CO and other species. Further progress can be expected in understanding the physical properties of disks from observations with sub-mm arrays like SMA, CARMA and ALMA, with mid infrared measurements using Spitzer, and near infrared spectroscopy with large ground-based telescopes. Intense efforts are also being made to model the observations using complex thermal-chemical models. After a brief review of the existing observations and modeling results, some of the weaknesses of the models will be discussed, including the absence of good laboratory and theoretical calculations for essential microscopic processes., Spectral observations of highly ionized elements in the solar corona indicate temperatures of order 10 6 K, nearly three orders of magnitude larger than photospheric temperatures. Numerous competing theories have proposed plausible mechanisms for sustaining these temperatures, but no consensus has yet been reached. I use satellite observations from the Yohkoh Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) to provide observational constraints on possible heating mechanisms. <P />I take a forward-modeling approach, using a parameterized approximation for existing coronal heating theories to predict soft X-ray emissions from individual observed solar active regions. Theories that predict observed emissions well are favored over theories that make poor predictions. <P />The forward model begins with a photospheric vector magnetic field measurement of an active region. To solve for the coronal magnetic field, I use a non- constant-alpha force-free field model. I choose several thousand magnetic fieldlines to represent the loop-like structures along which plasma is observed in the solar corona. Along each loop, I solve steady-state equations of mass, momentum, and energy conservation to determine thermodynamic quantities such as temperature and density. Taking into account satellite location and instrument response, I use these results to predict the expected coronal emissions from the active region in question, as observed by SXT. I evaluate 10 case study active regions using 4 heating parameterizations. <P />I find that the predictions of a volumetric heating rate that scales proportionally with average loop field strength and inversely with loop length come closest to matching observed emissions. This parameterization is most similar to the steady-state scaling of two proposed heating mechanisms: van Ballegooijen's ""current layers"" theory, taken in the AC limit where loop footpoint motions are rapid compared to Alfven travel times, and Parker's ""critical angle"" mechanism, taken in the case where the angle of misalignment is a twist angle. Although this parameterization best matches the observations, it does not match well enough to make a definitive statement on the nature of coronal heating. Nevertheless, I conclude that my method is a promising approach for studying heating in the absence of direct observational signatures, and I outline the improvements needed to make further progress., We are continuing EBIT measurements of line lists in the EUV region for use as astrophysical diagnostics and have recently measured the same transitions in much denser plasma of the NSTX tokamak. This allows us to calibrate density-sensitive line ratios at their upper limits. We compare our observations at low and high density with calculations from the Flexible Atomic Code., Observations of energetic ions of solar origin in the heliosphere suggest the existence of two main energization sites with different physical mechanisms: (1) impulsive mechanism on the flaring coronal magnetic field - via resonant interaction, presumably with low-frequency electromagnetic waves; (2) gradual mechanism around the propagating, interplanetary shock - by interaction with quasi-static inhomogeneous electromagnetic structure and low-frequency Alfvenic turbulence. While the coronal process enhances a subset of rare elements, the interplanetary interaction energizes most of the elements of coronal/solar wind origin. In the impulsive events, according to recent models, a significant fraction of heavy elements which reside on the active flaring flux rope is energized; the resonant interaction operates mainly on Fe and other heavy elements with high charge states. In the gradual events main energization occurs close to the Sun at low Mach numbers; significant interplanetary enhancement of energetic ion fluxes requires a narrow scale length in the propagating shock. Coupling of both processes results in the final heliospheric distribution function of the heavy elements. The enhanced energetic heavy ion population may have a profound impact on human space exploration in the interplanetary space as well as in the resulting trapped radiation in the magnetosphere., Astrophysical neutrinos at ~EeV energies promise to be an interesting source of information for astrophysics and particle physics. Detecting the predicted cosmogenic (""GZK"") neutrinos at 10<SUP>16</SUP> - 10<SUP>20</SUP> eV would test models of cosmic ray production at these energies and probe particle physics at ~100 TeV center-of-mass energy. While IceCube could detect ~1 GZK event per year, it is necessary to detect 10 or more events per year in order to study temporal, angular, and spectral distributions. The IceCube observatory may be able to achieve such event rates with an extension including optical, radio, and acoustic receivers. We present results from simulating such a hybrid detector., We report results from a Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) survey of interstellar molecular hydrogen (H<SUB>2</SUB>) along 45 sight lines to AGNs at high Galactic latitudes (b&gt;20<SUP>deg</SUP>). Most (39 out of 45) of the sight lines show detectable Galactic H<SUB>2</SUB> absorption from Lyman and Werner bands between 1000 and 1126 Å, with column densities ranging from N<SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB></SUB>=10<SUP>14.17</SUP> to 10<SUP>19.82</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. In the northern Galactic hemisphere, we identify many regions of low N<SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB></SUB> (&lt;=10<SUP>15</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) between l=60<SUP>deg</SUP> and 180° and at b&gt;54<SUP>deg</SUP>. These ``H<SUB>2</SUB> holes'' provide valuable, uncontaminated sight lines for extragalactic UV spectroscopy, and a few may be related to the ``Northern Chimney'' (low Na I absorption) and the ``Lockman Hole'' (low N<SUB>HI</SUB>). A comparison of high-latitude H<SUB>2</SUB> with 139 OB star sight lines surveyed in the Galactic disk suggests that high-latitude and disk H<SUB>2</SUB> clouds may have different rates of heating, cooling, and UV excitation. For rotational states J=0 and 1, the mean excitation temperature at high latitude, &lt;T<SUP>hl</SUP><SUB>01</SUB>&gt;=124+/-8 K, is somewhat higher than that in the Galactic disk, &lt;T<SUP>disk</SUP><SUB>01</SUB>&gt;=86+/-20 K. For J&gt;=2, the mean &lt;T<SUB>exc</SUB>&gt;=498+/-28 K, and the column-density ratios, N(3)/N(1), N(4)/N(0), and N(4)/N(2), indicate a comparable degree of UV excitation in the disk and low halo for sight lines with N<SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB></SUB>&gt;=10<SUP>18</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. The distribution of molecular fractions at high latitude shows a transition at lower total hydrogen column density (logN<SUP>hl</SUP><SUB>H</SUB>~20.38+/-0.13) than in the Galactic disk (logN<SUP>disk</SUP><SUB>H</SUB>~20.7). If the UV radiation fields are similar in disk and low halo, this suggests an enhanced H<SUB>2</SUB> (dust-catalyzed) formation rate in higher density, compressed clouds, which could be detectable as high-latitude, sheetlike infrared cirrus., We present a sample of 221 new quasar pairs with proper transverse separations R<SUB>prop</SUB>&lt;1 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc over the redshift range 0.5&lt;z&lt;3.0, discovered from an extensive follow-up campaign to find companions around the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 2dF QSO Redshift Survey quasars. This sample includes 26 new binary quasars with separations R<SUB>prop</SUB>&lt;50 h<SUP>-1</SUP> kpc (θ&lt;10<SUP>''</SUP>), more than doubling the number of such systems known. We define a statistical sample of binaries selected with homogeneous criteria and compute its selection function, taking into account sources of incompleteness. The first measurement of the quasar correlation function on scales 10 h<SUP>-1</SUP> kpc&lt;R<SUB>prop</SUB>&lt;400 h<SUP>-1</SUP> kpc is presented. For R<SUB>prop</SUB>&lt;~40 h<SUP>-1</SUP> kpc, we detect an order of magnitude excess clustering over the expectation from the large-scale (R<SUB>prop</SUB>&gt;~3 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc) quasar correlation function, extrapolated down as a power law (γ=1.53) to the separations probed by our binaries. The excess grows to ~30 at R<SUB>prop</SUB>~10 h<SUP>-1</SUP> kpc and provides compelling evidence that the quasar autocorrelation function gets progressively steeper on submegaparsec scales. This small-scale excess can likely be attributed to dissipative interaction events that trigger quasar activity in rich environments. Recent small-scale measurements of galaxy clustering and quasar-galaxy clustering are reviewed and discussed in relation to our measurement of small-scale quasar clustering., Landscapes are shaped by the uplift, deformation and breakdown of bedrock and the erosion, transport and deposition of sediment. Life is important in all of these processes. Over short timescales, the impact of life is quite apparent: rock weathering, soil formation and erosion, slope stability and river dynamics are directly influenced by biotic processes that mediate chemical reactions, dilate soil, disrupt the ground surface and add strength with a weave of roots. Over geologic time, biotic effects are less obvious but equally important: biota affect climate, and climatic conditions dictate the mechanisms and rates of erosion that control topographic evolution. Apart from the obvious influence of humans, does the resulting landscape bear an unmistakable stamp of life? The influence of life on topography is a topic that has remained largely unexplored. Erosion laws that explicitly include biotic effects are needed to explore how intrinsically small-scale biotic processes can influence the form of entire landscapes, and to determine whether these processes create a distinctive topography., We combine data from our recent FUSE survey of interstellar molecular hydrogen absorption toward 50 high-latitude AGNs with COBE-corrected IRAS 100 μm emission maps to study the correlation of infrared cirrus with H<SUB>2</SUB>. A plot of the H<SUB>2</SUB> column density versus IR cirrus intensity shows the same transition in molecular fraction, f<SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB></SUB>, as seen with total hydrogen column density, N<SUB>H</SUB>. This transition is usually attributed to H<SUB>2</SUB> ``self-shielding,'' and it suggests that many diffuse cirrus clouds contain H<SUB>2</SUB> in significant fractions, f<SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB></SUB>~1%-30%. These clouds cover ~50% of the northern sky at b&gt;30<SUP>deg</SUP>, at temperature-corrected 100 μm intensities D<SUP>T</SUP><SUB>100</SUB>&gt;=1.5 MJy sr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The sheetlike cirrus clouds, with hydrogen densities n<SUB>H</SUB>&gt;=30 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, may be compressed by dynamical processes at the disk-halo interface, and they are conducive to H<SUB>2</SUB> formation on grain surfaces. Exploiting the correlation between N<SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB></SUB> and 100 μm intensity, we estimate that cirrus clouds at b&gt;30<SUP>deg</SUP> contain ~3000 M<SUB>solar</SUB> in H<SUB>2</SUB>. Extrapolated over the inner Milky Way, the cirrus may contain 10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> of H<SUB>2</SUB> and 10<SUP>8</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> in total gas mass. If elevated to 100 pc, their gravitational potential energy is ~10<SUP>53</SUP> ergs., Imaging observations are generally affected by a fluctuating background of speckles, a particular problem when detecting faint stellar companions at small angular separations. These speckles can be created by both short-lived atmospheric aberrations and slowly changing distortions in the optical system. Over the course of a long-exposure image, the combination of many independent realizations of speckle patterns forms a halo in the point-spread function (PSF) of characteristic scale Δθ~λ/r<SUB>0</SUB> (where r<SUB>0</SUB> is the coherence length in the pupil). While adaptive optics can increase the achievable image contrast, speckle noise remains a major source of random error, which decreases the sensitivity of companion detection observations near the diffraction limit. Knowing the distribution of the speckle intensities at a given location in the image plane is therefore important for understanding the noise limits of companion detection. The speckle noise limit in a long-exposure image is characterized by the intensity variance and the speckle lifetime. In this paper we address the former quantity through the distribution function of speckle intensity. Previous theoretical work has predicted a form for this distribution function at a single location in the image plane. We developed a fast readout mode to take short exposures of stellar images corrected by adaptive optics at the ground-based UCO/Lick Observatory, with integration times of 5 ms and a time between successive frames of 14.5 ms (λ=2.2 μm). These observations temporally oversample and spatially Nyquist sample the observed speckle patterns. We show, for various locations in the image plane, that the observed distribution of speckle intensities is consistent with the predicted form. In addition, we demonstrate a method by which I<SUB>c</SUB> and I<SUB>s</SUB> can be mapped over the image plane. As the quantity I<SUB>c</SUB> is proportional to the PSF of the telescope free of random atmospheric aberrations, this method can be used for PSF calibration and reconstruction., On 1 June 2005, the prototype Nuclear Compton Telescope (NCT) flew on a high altitude balloon from Fort Sumner, New Mexico. NCT is a balloon-borne soft γ-ray (0.2-10 MeV) telescope for studying astrophysical sources of nuclear line emission and γ- ray polarization. Our program is designed to develop and test technologies and analysis techniques crucial for the Advanced Compton Telescope; however, our detector design and configuration is also well matched to the focal plane requirements for focusing Laue lenses. The NCT prototype utilizes two, 3D imaging germanium detectors (GeDs) in a novel, ultra-compact design optimized for nuclear line emission in the 0.5-2MeV range. Our prototype flight provides a critical test of the novel detector technologies, analysis techniques, and background rejection procedures developed for high resolution Compton telescopes., We report observations by Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) of thousands of peaked electron energy spectra similar to terrestrial auroral electrons. They are observed on the Martian nightside, near strong crustal magnetic sources. The spectra have peak energies ranging from 100 eV - 2.5 keV, and fluxes near the peak are 10-10000 times higher than typical nightside spectra. They occur on magnetic field lines that connect the shocked solar wind to crustal magnetic fields, and on adjacent closed field lines. Their detection is directly controlled by the solar wind, suggesting that magnetic reconnection is required for their observation. We calculate that the most energetic distributions could produce atmospheric emission with intensity comparable to that recently reported from the Mars Express (MEX) spacecraft. Half of the most energetic examples occur during the passage of space weather events past Mars, suggesting that a disturbed plasma environment is favorable for electron acceleration along magnetic field lines., We present the first scattered light images of debris disks around a K star (HD 53143) and an F star (HD 139664) using the coronagraphic mode of the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). With ages of 0.3-1 Gyr, these are among the oldest optically detected debris disks. HD 53143, viewed ~45° from edge-on, does not show radial variation in disk structure and has a width &gt;55 AU. HD 139664 is seen close to edge-on and has a beltlike morphology with a dust peak 83 AU from the star and a distinct outer boundary at 109 AU. We discuss evidence for significant diversity in the radial architecture of debris disks that appears unconnected to stellar spectral type or age. HD 139664 and possibly the solar system belong in a category of narrow belts 20-30 AU wide. HD 53143 represents a class of wide-disk architecture with a characteristic width &gt;50 AU., The discovery of the first gravitationally redshifted spectral line from a neutron star (NS) by Cottam et al. has triggered theoretical studies of the physics of atomic line formation in NS atmospheres. Chang et al. showed that the hydrogenic Fe Hα line formed above the photosphere of a bursting NS is intrinsically broad. We now include rotational broadening within general relativity and compare the resulting profile to that observed during type I bursts from EXO 0748-676. We show that the fine-structure splitting of the line precludes a meaningful constraint on the radius. Our fitting of the data show that the line-forming Fe column is log(N<SUB>Fe,n=2</SUB>/cm<SUP>-2</SUP>)=17.9<SUP>+0.27</SUP><SUB>-0.42</SUB> and gravitational redshift 1+z=1.345<SUP>+0.005</SUP><SUB>-0.008</SUB> with 95% confidence. We calculate the detectability of this spectral feature for a large range of spins and inclinations, assuming that the emission comes from the entire surface. We find that at 300 and 600 Hz only 10%-20% and 5%-10% of NSs would have spectral features as deep as those seen in EXO 0748-676., I discuss the problem of finding the fundamental parameters (mass, temperature, gravity, radius, and age) of ultra low-mass objects when they are very young. This is the part of parameter space where theoretical evolutionary models, which typically are used to extract the difficult parameters of age, mass, and radius from more observationally direct parameters like luminosity and spectral type, are expected to be least reliable. Studying binaries is one way to get around this problem; determining fundamental parameters from high resolution spectra is another (which is applicable to single stars). All these methods have their advantages and problems, and it is essential to make comparisons between them to develop trust in any of their answers. <P />Workshop ``Ultralow-mass star formation and evolution'', see AN 326, No. 10, We model weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structure by ray tracing through N-body simulations. The algorithms are described with particular attention paid to numerical convergence and potential artifacts. We explore how well several standard assumptions and approximations commonly assumed in lensing hold, especially near large peaks in the projected mass. A semi- analytic description of the resolution of the resulting simulated maps is developed, so that we are able to predict the fidelity of the resulting data as a function of computational cost. We explicitly demonstrate the feasibility of creating large suites of simulations using automated routines with minimal user input, and in the process create the first simulated maps of the lensing shear and convergence for dark energy models. The simulated maps are used to model the effect of seeing and extinction modulations in weak lensing surveys, and find that these give rise to fluctuations in the shear E-mode signal, which is poorly tracked by the corresponding induced B-modes. Exquisite control of such systematics will be required in the era of precision cosmology. <P />We then investigate the prospect of measuring galaxy cluster mass profiles from simulated lensed maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). We examine the efficacy of several techniques of cluster mass reconstruction using CMB lensing information, and estimate the level of success for a fiducial survey. We perform a similar analysis on larger scales using an optimal quadratic estimator to reconstruct the projected mass distribution from the time of last scattering up to the current era, and to estimate the corresponding power spectrum. In both cases, we also study contamination by the kinetic Sunyaev- Zel'dovich effect, which is spectrally indistinguishable from lensed CMB anisotropies., Pore water chemistry and <SUP>234</SUP>U/ <SUP>238</SUP>U activity ratios from fine-grained sediment cored by the Ocean Drilling Project at Site 984 in the North Atlantic were used as constraints in modeling in situ rates of plagioclase dissolution with the multicomponent reactive transport code Crunch. The reactive transport model includes a solid-solution formulation to enable the use of the <SUP>234</SUP>U/ <SUP>238</SUP>U activity ratios in the solid and fluid as a tracer of mineral dissolution. The isotopic profiles are combined with profiles of the major element chemistry (especially alkalinity and calcium) to determine whether the apparent discrepancy between laboratory and field dissolution rates still exists when a mechanistic reactive transport model is used to interpret rates in a natural system. A suite of reactions, including sulfate reduction and methane production, anaerobic methane oxidation, CaCO <SUB>3</SUB> precipitation, dissolution of plagioclase, and precipitation of secondary clay minerals, along with diffusive transport and fluid and solid burial, control the pore fluid chemistry in Site 984 sediments. The surface area of plagioclase in intimate contact with the pore fluid is estimated to be 6.9 m <SUP>2</SUP>/g based on both grain geometry and on the depletion of <SUP>234</SUP>U/ <SUP>238</SUP>U in the sediment via α-recoil loss. Various rate laws for plagioclase dissolution are considered in the modeling, including those based on (1) a linear transition state theory (TST) model, (2) a nonlinear dependence on the undersaturation of the pore water with respect to plagioclase, and (3) the effect of inhibition by dissolved aluminum. The major element and isotopic methods predict similar dissolution rate constants if additional lowering of the pore water <SUP>234</SUP>U/ <SUP>238</SUP>U activity ratio is attributed to isotopic exchange via recrystallization of marine calcite, which makes up about 10-20% of the Site 984 sediment. The calculated dissolution rate for plagioclase corresponds to a rate constant that is about 10 <SUP>2</SUP> to 10 <SUP>5</SUP> times smaller than the laboratory-measured value, with the value depending primarily on the deviation from equilibrium. The reactive transport simulations demonstrate that the degree of undersaturation of the pore fluid with respect to plagioclase depends strongly on the rate of authigenic clay precipitation and the solubility of the clay minerals. The observed discrepancy is greatest for the linear TST model (10 <SUP>5</SUP>), less substantial with the Al-inhibition formulation (10 <SUP>3</SUP>), and decreases further if the clay minerals precipitate more slowly or as highly soluble precursor minerals (10 <SUP>2</SUP>). However, even several orders of magnitude variation in either the clay solubility or clay precipitation rates cannot completely account for the entire discrepancy while still matching pore water aluminum and silica data, indicating that the mineral dissolution rate conundrum must be attributed in large part to the gradual loss of reactive sites on silicate surfaces with time. The results imply that methods of mineral surface characterization that provide direct measurements of the bulk surface reactivity are necessary to accurately predict natural dissolution rates., I have characterized the orbits of over 100 exoplanets using precision radial velocity (RV) measurements from the California &amp; Carnegie and Anglo-Australian Planet Searches. Proper estimates of the errors on orbital elements require a thorough understanding of the sources and nature of uncertainties in the RV data, which is a function of the amount of stellar magnetic activity on a stars surface. <P />I have measured stellar magnetic activity in 1200 Planet Search program stars using the chromospheric Ca II H and K emission cores from the same spectra used to make precision RV measurements. I have reduced these data to Mount Wilson S indices and used the canonical age-activity relation to derive ages for these stars. <P />I find that this age-activity relation breaks down for very inactive and slightly evolved stars, yielding, for instance, erroneously large ages for subgiants. This is because the calibration of the relation ignores the effects of evolution and abundance in its conversion of S -indices to [Special characters omitted.] values. This miscalibration has resulted in some confusion over the nature of some evolved stars, leading to their misclassification in the literature as examples of stars in extraordinary states of inactivity analogous to the solar Maunder Minimum. <P />I have analyzed the RV time series for stars observed at Keck Observatory to determine the magnitude of astrophysical and instrumental RV noise, jitter, as a function of color, activity level, and evolution. I quantify the increase in jitter with activity and decrease in B-V. <P />I have used this jitter formula and the latest RV measurements to recalculate the orbits of 100 previously known exoplanets, updating and improving their orbital parameters and error estimates. I have combined this information with data I compiled on all other known nearby exoplanets to create the Catalog of Nearby Exoplanets. This catalog contains stellar properties, orbital parameters, and RV data or references for all 172 known exoplanets, including 5 previously unreported planets. <P />I have also used the jitter formula to measure false alarm probabilities for the existence of additional companions orbiting planet-bearing stars, and discuss constraining the orbital parameters of planets with incomplete orbits., We use simulated maps to investigate the ability of high resolution, low noise (roughly 10 μK-arcmin beam) surveys of the CMB to create catalogues of clusters of galaxies by detecting the characteristic signature imprinted by the Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect. We compute the completeness and efficiency of the catalogues in our simulations for several survey strategies, and find that while the primary CMB anisotropy does not degrade this effort, point source confusion is a more significant problem, which may necessitate the use of either multi-frequency observations or a single frequency at which the effect is likely to be relatively small. We also evaluate the relative merit of some Fourier and wavelet based filtering techniques, and find that simple frequency-space filtering is at least as good as wavelet techniques for the purpose of creating complete and efficient catalogues of clusters., Merging is the fundamental process in the growth of cosmological structures and is central to galaxy formation and evolution. We use numerical simulations to investigate the effects of mergers on dark matter halos and elliptical galaxies and to understand the role of black holes in the merger process. <P />We first explore mergers of dark matter halos and show that the central properties of a merger remnant are primarily determined by those of its progenitors: mergers of two cuspy halos result in a cuspy remnant, while mergers of two cored halos yield a cored remnant. Halo substructure can have a significant effect on halo structure, however. Massive subhalos sink to the halo center by dynamical friction, heating the halo center, and lose mass due to tidal stripping. The balance between heating and mass deposition determines whether the central density cusp flattens or steepens. <P />Next, we study major mergers of elliptical galaxies and show that the fundamental plane relation is preserved for all configurations of merger orbits. The projections of the fundamental plane, however, do depend on orbit; this dependence allows us to predict that massive elliptical galaxies, including brightest cluster galaxies, likely formed in dissipationless mergers on relatively radial orbits. The invariance of the fundamental plane is a manifestation of virial equilibrium while the orbital dependence of the projections is due to varying amounts of energy loss from dynamical friction for different orbits. <P />We also consider minor mergers of ellipticals and the roles dark matter and black holes play in setting the properties of the remnant. Mergers onto a galaxy with a central supermassive black hole generally result in the destruction of the satellite galaxy, preserving the inner structure of the host galaxy. Including dark matter in the galaxies deepens the potential well, increasing the orbital velocities and the amount of tidal heating and stripping of the satellite galaxies. Finally, we investigate how galactic nuclei respond to gravitational radiation recoil, which results from a merger of an unequal- mass black hole binary system. A generic effect of this recoil is to create a core in the galaxy's central density., This thesis presents an extensive observational study of the Lynds dark cloud L1551 with the goal of understanding the past, present, and future star formation in the region. This is achieved by considering the connection between the diverse phenomena observed within the cloud and the cloud environment. Roughly 140 [Special characters omitted.] of total mass at ~15 K lies within a 0.9 pc projected radius, and the dispersion in molecular line emission is close to what is expected from a virialized cloud. <P />Roughly 35 pre-main sequence stars comprise the L1551 association which has a spread in mass ~0.1--1.5 [Special characters omitted.] and a spread in age of more than 6 times the dynamical time of the present day cloud. The older stars are more spatially dispersed and may be slightly more massive than the recently formed stars. <P />A pre-stellar core discovered in L1551 is evidence that there will be at least one more star or stellar system to form in the cloud. This ~2 [Special characters omitted.] cold core, named L1551-MC, is likely to collapse in [Special characters omitted.] 1 Myr. Asymmetric molecular line profiles toward L1551-MC suggest that it is building up mass via accretion and no sign of gravitational collapse is seen. L1551-MC also appears chemically young through the comparison of emission from several molecular species. <P />A high-resolution, wide-field mosaic of L1551 using the BIMA interferometer is combined with single-dish data to construct fully sampled maps in both 13 CO(1 - 0) and C 18 O(1 - 0). The 13 CO emission shows clear evidence for the destruction of the cloud by the embedded stars while the line wings trace the boundaries between outflows and ambient gas. The C 18 O emission is optically thin and is used to characterize the turbulence in L1551 which may be due to stellar feedback. No other significant input of energy is seen. <P />The derived quantities in this thesis along with auxiliary information from the literature are used to construct a comprehensive picture of star formation in L1551. The timeline of events is inconsistent with purely dynamical models and is most consistent with a scenario where stellar feedback mediates star formation. Magnetic field measurements within L1551 are needed to quantify their role in the evolution of the cloud., We present UBVRI photometry of 44 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observed from 1997 to 2001 as part of a continuing monitoring campaign at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. The data set comprises 2190 observations and is the largest homogeneously observed and reduced sample of SNe Ia to date, nearly doubling the number of well-observed, nearby SNe Ia with published multicolor CCD light curves. The large sample of U-band photometry is a unique addition, with important connections to SNe Ia observed at high redshift. The decline rate of SN Ia U-band light curves correlates well with the decline rate in other bands, as does the U-B color at maximum light. However, the U-band peak magnitudes show an increased dispersion relative to other bands even after accounting for extinction and decline rate, amounting to an additional ~40% intrinsic scatter compared to the B band., Biofilm-embedded Mn oxides exert important controls on trace metal cycling in aquatic and soil environments. The speciation and mobility of Zn in particular has been linked to Mn oxides found in streams, wetlands, soils, and aquifers. We investigated the mechanisms of Zn sorption to a biogenic Mn oxide within a biofilm produced by model soil and freshwater Mn <SUP>II</SUP>-oxidizing bacteria Pseudomonas putida. The biogenic Mn oxide is a c-disordered birnessite with hexagonal layer symmetry. Zinc adsorption isotherm and Zn and Mn K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy experiments were conducted at pH 6.9 to characterize Zn sorption to this biogenic Mn oxide, and to determine whether the bioorganic components of the biofilm affect metal sorption properties. The EXAFS data were analyzed by spectral fitting, principal component analysis, and linear least-squares fitting with reference spectra. Zinc speciation was found to change as Zn loading to the biosorbent [bacterial cells, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and biogenic Mn oxide] increased. At low Zn loading (0.13 ± 0.04 mol Zn kg <SUP>-1</SUP> biosorbent), Zn was sorbed to crystallographically well-defined sites on the biogenic oxide layers in tetrahedral coordination to structural O atoms. The fit to the EXAFS spectrum was consistent with Zn sorption above and below the Mn <SUP>IV</SUP> vacancy sites of the oxide layers. As Zn loading increased to 0.72 ± 0.04 mol Zn kg <SUP>-1</SUP> biosorbent, Zn was also detected in octahedral coordination to these sites. Overall, our results indicate that the biofilm did not intervene in Zn sorption by the Mn-oxide because sorption to the organic material was observed only after all Mn vacancy sites were capped by Zn. The organic functional groups present in the biofilm contributed significantly to Zn removal from solution when Zn concentrations exceeded the sorption capacity of the biooxide. At the highest Zn loading studied, 1.50 ± 0.36 mol Zn kg <SUP>-1</SUP> biosorbent, the proportion of total Zn sorption attributed to bioorganic material was 38 mol%. The maximum Zn loading to the biogenic oxide that we observed was 4.1 mol Zn kg <SUP>-1</SUP> biogenic Mn oxide, corresponding to 0.37 ± 0.02 mol Zn mol <SUP>-1</SUP> Mn. This loading is in excellent agreement with previous estimates of the content of cation vacancies in the biogenic oxide. The results of this study improve our knowledge of Zn speciation in natural systems and are consistent with those of Zn speciation in mineral soil fractions and ferromanganese nodules where the Mn oxides present are possibly biogenic., Magnetic reconnection in a current sheet converts magnetic energy into particle energy, a process that is important in many laboratory, space and astrophysical contexts. It is not known at present whether reconnection is fundamentally a process that can occur over an extended region in space or whether it is patchy and unpredictable in nature. Frequent reports of small-scale flux ropes and flow channels associated with reconnection in the Earth's magnetosphere raise the possibility that reconnection is intrinsically patchy, with each reconnection X-line (the line along which oppositely directed magnetic field lines reconnect) extending at most a few Earth radii (R<SUB>E</SUB>), even though the associated current sheets span many tens or hundreds of R<SUB>E</SUB>. Here we report three-spacecraft observations of accelerated flow associated with reconnection in a current sheet embedded in the solar wind flow, where the reconnection X-line extended at least 390R<SUB>E</SUB> (or 2.5 × 10<SUP>6</SUP>km). Observations of this and 27 similar events imply that reconnection is fundamentally a large-scale process. Patchy reconnection observed in the Earth's magnetosphere is therefore likely to be a geophysical effect associated with fluctuating boundary conditions, rather than a fundamental property of reconnection. Our observations also reveal, surprisingly, that reconnection can operate in a quasi-steady-state manner even when undriven by the external flow., More than 600 high resolution spectra of stars with spectral type F and later were obtained in order to search for signatures of differential rotation in line profiles. In 147 stars the rotation law could be measured, with 28 of them found to be differentially rotating. Comparison to rotation laws in stars of spectral type A reveals that differential rotation sets in at the convection boundary in the HR-diagram; no star that is significantly hotter than the convection boundary exhibits the signatures of differential rotation. Four late A-/early F-type stars close to the convection boundary and at v sin{i} ≈ 100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> show extraordinarily strong absolute shear at short rotation periods around one day. It is suggested that this is due to their small convection zone depth and that it is connected to a narrow range in surface velocity; the four stars are very similar in T<SUB>eff</SUB> and v sin{i}. Detection frequencies of differential rotation α = ΔΩ/Ω &gt; 0 were analyzed in stars with varying temperature and rotation velocity. Measurable differential rotation is more frequent in late-type stars and slow rotators. The strength of absolute shear, ΔΩ, and differential rotation α are examined as functions of the stellar effective temperature and rotation period. The highest values of ΔΩ are found at rotation periods between two and three days. In slower rotators, the strongest absolute shear at a given rotation rate ΔΩ<SUB>max</SUB> is given approximately by ΔΩ<SUB>max</SUB> ∝ P<SUP>-1</SUP>, i.e., α<SUB>max</SUB> ≈ const. In faster rotators, both α<SUB>max</SUB> and ΔΩ<SUB>max</SUB> diminish less rapidly. A comparison with differential rotation measurements in stars of later spectral type shows that F-stars exhibit stronger shear than cooler stars do and the upper boundary in absolute shear ΔΩ with temperature is consistent with the temperature-scaling law found in Doppler Imaging measurements., We present results from a new simulation code that accounts for the evolution of the reservoirs of carbon dioxide on Mars, from its early years to the present. We establish a baseline model parameter set that produces results compatible with the present (i.e., P≃6.5 mbar with permanent CO <SUB>2</SUB> ice cap) for a wide range of initial inventories. We find that the initial inventory of CO <SUB>2</SUB> broadly determines the evolutionary course of the reservoirs of CO <SUB>2</SUB>. The reservoirs include the atmosphere, ice cap, adsorbed CO <SUB>2</SUB> in the regolith, and carbonate rocks. We track the evolution of the free inventory: the atmosphere, ice cap and regolith. Simulations begin at 4.53 Gyr before present with a rapid loss of free inventory to space in the early Noachian. Models that assume a relatively small initial inventory (≲5 bar) have pronounced minima in the free inventory of CO <SUB>2</SUB> toward the end of the Noachian. Under baseline parameters, initial inventories below ∼4.5 bar result in a catastrophic loss of the free inventory to space. The current free inventory would be then determined by the balance between outgassing, sputtering losses and chemical weathering following the end of the late bombardment. We call these ""thin"" models. They generically predict small current free inventories in line with expectations of a small present CO <SUB>2</SUB> ice cap. For ""thick"" models, with initial inventories ≳5 bar, a surplus of 300-700 mbar of free CO <SUB>2</SUB> remains during the late-Noachian. The histories of free inventory in time for thick models tend to converge within the last 3.5 Gyr toward a present with an ice cap plus atmospheric inventory of about 100 mbar. For thick models, the convergence is largely due to the effects of chemical weathering, which draws down higher free inventories more rapidly than the low. Thus, thick models have ≳450 mbar carbonate reservoirs, while thin models have ≲200 mbar. Though both thick and thin scenarios can reproduce the current atmospheric pressure, the thick models imply a relatively large current CO <SUB>2</SUB> ice cap and thin models, little or none. While the sublimation of a massive cap at a high obliquity would create a climate swing of greenhouse warming for thick models, under the thin model, mean temperatures and pressures would be essentially unaffected by increases in obliquity., Several two-ribbon X-class flares which occurred near the solar disk center are investigated in this study. Some specific sub-regions within an active region are selected to estimate the change in magnetic flux from pre-flare to post-flare states. The high-cadence (1-min averaged) MDI magnetogram provides comprehensive photospheric magnetic measurement during these flares. The extreme ultraviolet observations in the wavelengths of 171, 195, and 1600 nm obtained by TRACE are used to search for the correlation of magnetic changes in the corona and transition region. We also used the RHESSI data to identify the hard X-ray source regions and compare them with the magnetic observations. We found that the magnetic fluxes within or in the vicinity of ribbons can change permanently after a flare eruption. Transient magnetic changes are also found in sub-regions. The characteristics of these X-class flares will be discussed in detail in this presentation., Solar impulsive electron events (SIEEs) are often related to radio type III bursts and are thought to be accelerated in the solar corona. It is therefore expected that they should produce X-rays through bremmsstrahlung whose flux is dependent on the height of the accelerator. Previous studies have shown that low energy SEIIs appear to be the source of type III radio bursts. The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) provides unique sensitivity in the 3-15 keV energy range, with an effective area ~100 times larger than similar past instruments. RHESSI is therefore uniquely suited to study small events. The 3-D Plasma and Energetic Particle Instrument (3DP) on the WIND spacecraft measures in-situ energetic particles with energies from ~0.4 to 300 keV. WIND has observed a total of 547 SIEEs since the launch of RHESSI. A total of 303 of these events have simultaneous RHESSI observations and 444 events show an associated type III radio burst. We concentrate on low energy events as observed by 3DP (SEIIs energy &lt; 20 keV) with an associated radio type III and simulatenous RHESSI observations. We find a total of 68 such events. We compare the X-ray producing and SEII particle populations and the expected to observed X-ray flux based on the acceleration height derived from the starting frequency of the metric type III observations. This work was supported by GSRP Grant NNM-05ZA12H and NASA contract NAS5-98033., We investigate the emission-line properties of galaxies with red rest-frame colors (compared to the g-r color bimodality) using spectra from Data Release 2 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Emission lines are detected in more than half of the red galaxies. We focus on the relationship between two emission lines commonly used as star formation rate indicators: Hα and [OII] λ 3727. Since [OII] is the principal proxy for Hα at z ∼1, the correlation between them is critical for comparison between low-z and high-z galaxy surveys. We find strong bimodality in [OII]/Hα ratio in the SDSS sample, which closely corresponds to the bimodality in rest-frame color. Based on standard line diagnostics, we find that most of the line-emitting red galaxies would be classified as LINERs, with a small fraction of Seyferts and some intermediate objects. [OII] emission in LINERs can be as strong as that in star-forming galaxies. Thus, without a careful pre-selection of galaxy samples to remove red/quiescent galaxies, it can not be used directly as a proxy for star formation rate. Lack of [OII] emission is generally used to indicate lack of star formation when post-starburst galaxies are selected at high redshift. Our results imply, however, that these samples have been cut on LINER/AGN properties as well as star formation, and therefore may provide seriously incomplete sets of post-starburst galaxies. In fact, post-starburst galaxies identifed in SDSS by requiring minimal Hα equivalent width often have strong [OII] emission, which suggest they harbor AGNs., THEMIS is a 5 spacecraft (probe) mission to launch in Fall of 2006. Its near equatorial probes will align once per 4 days to provide measurements along the tail between 10 and 30 Earth Radii, in order to distinguish between competing substorm theories. Over 180hrs of alignments will be possible each year. A ground network of white-light imagers and magnetomers in Canada and Alaska will ensure that the relevant alignments (at onset meridian) will qualify as prime candidates for extensive analysis. Particular emphasis is placed in determining current disruption and reconnection onset times, in relation to ground onset times. Current disruption and reconnection locations, onset times and speeds are determined using a variety of techniques: Energetic ion sounding or remote sensing, flow speeds, ExB speeds and dipolarization-front time-delays from one probe to another. It is expected that about twenty substorms will measured at their onset meridian during the 2-year nominal lifetime. This number will permit studies of onset mechanism dependence on external factors such as solar wind triggers, precursor pseudobreakups or ionospheric conditions. Interpretational challenges and ancillary datasets augmenting this mission beyond what was originally envisioned will also be discussed., RHESSI observations often show hard x-ray emission from non-flaring active regions. The objective of this work is to search for hard x-ray emission that is not associated with active regions. There are a number of potential sources for such emission, some of which are relevant to coronal heating. With its shutters open RHESSI has greater sensitivity in the 5-25 keV range than previous missions. It uses a set of 9 rotating modulation collimators to image sources with size scales from 2 arcseconds to 3 arcminutes. However, since the quiet Sun sources may be well-dispersed spatially across the disk, RHESSI's normal imaging technique is not well suited to the task. An alternate observational technique involves pointing RHESSI slightly away from the Sun. Then the time-dependent transmission of the thick individual grids (whose field of view is 1 degree) chops the integrated solar signal at ~0.5 Hz to provide effective background suppression. This paper describes the technique and initial results from a period of offpointing observations (19-July-05 to 25-July-05) acquired when the GOES background level dropped to below A2 and there were no active regions visible on the disk., We have mapped the amplitude of Mars' crustal magnetic field at 170 km altitude (B170) using electron reflection data from the MAG/ER experiment onboard Mars Global Surveyor. The increased sensitivity and nearly complete sampling of this new map reveal numerous weak magnetic sources in the northern lowlands. A partial ring of enhanced B170 values surrounds the Utopia basin. This magnetic ring lies just outside of the 3200-km-diameter main topographic rim and coincides with an annulus of increased crustal thickness derived from MGS gravity and altimetry [Neumann et al., JGR 109, E08002, 2004]. The southeastern part of the ring is missing, although it could have been thermally demagnetized by the Elysium volcanic region. There is no evidence for magnetic sources inside the ring. The ring could consist of magnetized crust that survived the Utopia impact. The survival of magnetic sources just outside of the main topographic rim would be consistent with the demagnetization signatures of Hellas and Argyre. Alternatively, the annulus of increased crustal thickness could mark the location of an inner ring that was remagnetized after the Utopia impact. A larger 4070-km-diameter ring for the Utopia basin was proposed on the basis that it fits the dichotomy boundary from 70 to 120 degrees east [Frey and Schultz, GRL 15, 229, 1988]. If this ring is interpreted as the main rim, then the magnetic annulus would be at 0.9 basin radii, where part of the crust could have been shock heated above the Curie temperature. An even larger ring, 5250 km in diameter, is defined by a 120-degree arc of magnetic sources to the north and west of the basin that is roughly concentric with the main topographic rim. This largest ring intersects several additional magnetic sources east of the basin. Whether the annulus of increased crustal thickness surrounding Utopia was magnetized before or just after the impact, its existence reveals the presence of magnetized early Noachian crust in the northern lowlands., A sample of hundreds of simulated galaxy clusters is used to study the statistical properties of galaxy cluster formation. Individual assembly histories are discussed, the degree of virialization is demonstrated and various commonly used formation times are measured and inter-compared. In addition, the fraction of clusters which have ""recently"" undergone a major merger or significant mass jump is calculated as a function of lookback time and interval. The fraction of three- and four-body mergers is also studied., It has been proposed that Ca isotope fractionation is produced mainly by biological processes, and hence that Ca isotope effects may be a tracer of biological activity in the geologic records of both Earth and Mars. However, Ca isotope fractionation has been produced for rapid precipitation of calcite and aragonite in laboratory experiments, and this fractionation is interpreted to be kinetic% by some investigators and equilibrium by others. Whether the experimental results apply to natural conditions is unknown. To investigate whether there is Ca isotope fractionation in natural inorganic processes, we have measured evaporite minerals precipitated in the Badwater salt pan, Death Valley, California. Death Valley is the hottest and driest desert in North America. Average summer temperatures are 37.8° C with a maximum record of 56.7° C and an annual average of 26° C. Potential evaporation is about 3.8~m/yr, which is 100 times average precipitation. A continuous 200,000-year record of closed-basin calcite and sulfate precipitation is available from a 186-meter sediment core into Badwater Basin. The δ18O and δD variations of fluid inclusion waters in halite are consistent with flooding-dissolution-evaporation cycles (Yang et al., 1995; 1997). The δ18O records of calcite and sulfate reflect the timing and driving forces of late Quaternary paleoclimatic changes (Yang et al., 1998; 2005). The longer-term (96,000, 39,000 and 21,000 years) fluctuations match Milankovitch orbital forcing, and are likely to be global in origin; the shorter-term (14,000 and 8,000 years) fluctuations probably reflect regional climatic and/or hydrologic forcing. Excursions in calcite δ18O are similar to those of δ18O in sulfate in the Death Valley core, and mimic those in marine carbonate (SPECMAP) and polar ice in the Summit ice core (GRIP), Greenland. Preliminary study of Ca isotopes in the calcite and sulfate minerals from the Badwater saline sediment core shows no significant variations through the core, regardless of the evaporation-dissolution-flooding cycles indicated by O and D isotopes, evaporative chemical evolution of the saline lake waters, mineralogy, depositional environment and glacial-interglacial climatic periods. The δ44Ca value of both carbonates and sulfates (-0.3‰~ relative to bulk Earth Ca or -1.2‰~ relative to seawater) is also nearly identical to that expected for dissolved Ca in local runoff. These results indicate that the Ca isotope fractionation factor associated with precipitation of both carbonate and sulfate under natural conditions is very close to unity, that is, α = 1.0000~ ± ~0.0001. This suggests that the fractionation factor of approximately 0.9985 observed for the formation of bone and shell in both vertebrates and invertebrates is not an equilibrium thermodynamic effect., The strength and orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) has a strong effect on the high latitude plasma convection pattern, thereby influencing the speed and direction of thermospheric winds. The possibility of similar IMF control over the compositional response of the thermosphere during geomagnetic disturbances has not been fully investigated. This study finds that the y-component of the IMF (IMF By) exerts significant control over the development and subsequent transport of composition disturbances during periods of heightened geomagnetic activity. This is accomplished using global-scale far-ultraviolet images from the first 3 weeks of the Dynamics Explorer 1 mission, and thermospheric modeling using the NCAR-TIMEGCM for this period. The images reveal changes in the relative thermospheric column abundance of O vs. N2 (σO/N2). These changes are reproduced by the model, incorporating variable IMF strength and orientation as inputs. It is found that simple reversal of IMF By leads to subsequent changes in σO/N2 at middle latitudes by as much as 30%. Multiple occurrences of strong IMF By influence at middle latitudes are found in the study period, suggesting that they are common in nature. The study confirms an earlier hypothesis that IMF-By effects on middle-latitude thermospheric composition are important, however it suggests that the effect of By is opposite of that suggested in the earlier report. The study also provides a powerful illustration of the value of global-scale imaging in validating 3-D global simulations., The GOES-class X4.8 event on 23 July 2002 exhibits significant hard X-ray emission prior to the impulsive phase of the flare. Images from the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) show that most of the emission appears to originate from a coronal source. Analysis of the Fe (~6.7 keV) and Fe/Ni (~8 keV) line complexes seen in RHESSI spectra suggests that there is little or no thermal continuum emission above ~15 keV, thus implying that non-thermal electron bremsstrahlung dominates the spectrum even to low energies. The X3.1 event on 24 Aug 2002 displays similar characteristics, and its position at the west limb occults the footpoints and shows that the bulk of the HXR emission unambiguously originates in the corona. Preliminary analysis shows that the pre-impulsive spectra are well-fit by a broken power-law characteristic of non-thermal emission. The spectral indices above and below the break energy differ by ~2, suggesting that we may be observing the transition between thin- and thick-target bremsstrahlung. The break energy increases with time, which suggests an average electron pitch angle of ~45°, assuming an increasing column density derived from the thermal emission measure. We analyze and compare the RHESSI X-ray spectra for the pre-impulsive phases of both 24 Aug 2002 and 23 July 2002, using the Fe and Fe/Ni line complexes to constrain the thermal parameters. We derive the time-varying characteristics of the electron populations and discuss the implications for acceleration and heating of electrons in the corona during this period., Magnetic reconnection in a current sheet is a magnetic to particle energy conversion process that is important in many space and astrophysical contexts. It is not presently known whether reconnection is fundamentally a process that can occur over an extended region in space or whether it is patchy and unpredictable in nature. Here we report Wind, ACE, and Cluster observations of accelerated flow associated with reconnection in a current sheet embedded in the solar wind flow where the reconnection X-line extended at least 390 RE (or 2.5 million km). Observations of this and 27 similar events imply that reconnection is fundamentally large scale. Patchy and transient reconnection often reported in the magnetosphere is likely to be a geophysical effect associated with boundary conditions rather than a fundamental property of reconnection. Our observations also reveal, somewhat surprisingly, that reconnection can operate in a quasi-steady-state manner even when undriven by the external flow., Cyanuric acid, C3N3O3H3, has been observed in protoplanetary systems and recovered from carbonaceous meteorites. By documenting the structural and chemical transitions of cyanuric acid, we can gain clues about the origins and transformation mechanisms of pre-biotic material. An understanding of the spectral properties of processed materials could be used to identify their presence on extrasolar planets, given appropriate spectra. Cyanuric acid is of special interest because it has a ring structure consisting of alternating C and N atoms. Critical biological components, such as nucleobases, incorporate these carbon-nitrogen rings. Using X-ray diffraction and FTIR spectroscopy in the diamond anvil cell, we have begun a study of the stability of cyanuric acid at room temperature and pressures up to 30 GPa. Using a third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state, we determine a preliminary bulk modulus of K_0 = 0.1 GPa (K'_0=5.0), for pressures up to 10 GPa. The recovered samples appear to be denser than the initial sample by a factor of 3. FTIR spectroscopy up to 30 GPa suggests the formation of N--H·sO and C--O·sH intramolecular bonds, which could be a step towards stable molecules of greater complexity., During the magnetospheric disturbances of January 21st 2005 the MINIS balloon campaign observed intense X-ray bursts at three locations separated in L-shell and local time. These X-rays are bremsstrahlung radiation produced by highly relativistic (~1MeV) electrons precipitating out of the Earth's radiation belt and the bursts show interesting spatial and temporal structure. We will present a brief background on single-point observations from previous balloon campaigns and show the unique structure revealed by these newer multi-point observations. We have also modeled the bremsstrahlung production and atmospheric scattering to obtain the energy spectrum and flux of precipitating electrons. Using these modeling results we then make an estimate of the loss rate of high energy electrons from the trapped population. Estimating the loss rate is an essential part of understanding the trapped population of these killer electrons., On 1 June 2005, the prototype Nuclear Compton Telescope (NCT) flew on a high altitude balloon from Fort Sumner, New Mexico. NCT is a balloon-borne soft γ-ray (0.2 10 MeV) telescope for studying astrophysical sources of nuclear line emission and γ-ray polarization. Our program is designed to develop and test technologies and analysis techniques crucial for the Advanced Compton Telescope; however, our detector design and configuration is also well matched to the focal plane requirements for focusing Laue lenses. The NCT prototype utilizes two, 3D imaging germanium detectors (GeDs) in a novel, ultra-compact design optimized for nuclear line emission in the 0.5 2 MeV range. Our prototype flight provides a critical test of the novel detector technologies, analysis techniques, and background rejection procedures developed for high resolution Compton telescopes., Silica (SiO2) is a major chemical constituent of the Earth, and its properties at high pressures and temperatures are important both for deep-earth geophysics and for studies of terrestrial impact events. A number of interesting phenomena, such as amorphization on static compression and the formation of microstructures on dynamic shock compression, were first experimentally observed in silica and subsequently seen in a wide variety of dielectric materials, including other planetary minerals. Here, we report experimental evidence for increased electrical conduction in molten SiO2 at extreme pressures and temperatures. Using laser-driven shock waves, two initial forms of SiO2, fused silica and alpha-quartz, were subjected to multi-Megabar pressures and temperatures of tens of thousands of Kelvin. Light at 532 nm reflected from the samples provides a measurement of the optical opacity or reflectivity of the shocked material. These measurements suggest that initially transparent silica, characterized by a wide gap between the electronic energy bands, exhibits a major increase in electrical conductivity: first, there is a discontinuous increase on melting, and then a continuous increase with temperature and pressure in the molten state, presumably in response to chemical dissociation of the SiO2. It is likely that similar behavior will be identified in other dielectric materials, including the primary constituent of the Earths mantle, MgSiO3 perovskite. These results may be crucial for understanding the properties of melts in the deep mantle, and add a new dimension to the physics of terrestrial impact events., In this presentation, we show two kinds of electron precipitations observed by the Korean satellite STSAT-1. One is microburst that has very short duration of less than 1 second. Our observations show microburst energy spectra of precipitated electrons inside the loss cone (precipitated) have higher e-folding energies during disturbed times than quiet times. The loss cone at these energies is empty except when microbursts abruptly appear and fill the loss cone in less than 50 msec. This fast pitch angle diffusion requires diffusion coefficients be larger than ~3.5 ×10-2 rad2/sec, while ~1.5 ×10-5 rad2/sec was proposed by Albert (2002). The other precipitation has long duration of a few hours at the midnight trapping boundary. These events occur under quiet geomagnetic condition and display energy dispersion in the low latitude boundary. We have modeled this precipitation form invoking pitch angle scattering in the field reversal region where magnetic field significantly varies within a cyclotron radius and the first adiabatic invariant is not conserved. Our observations show these two kinds of precipitation could be the dominant loss mechanism of relativistic electrons in the radiation belt., Cluster has observed ion holes in the solar wind upstream of the bow shock. We will present detailed structure of the ion holes and their relation with the bow shock. The ion holes are characterized by the thermalized plasmas with the density lower than that of the surrounding plasmas. They are accompanied by magnetic holes. We have determined the boundary normal orientation and speed using the timing analysis of the 4 Cluster spacecrafts. The boundary normal orientations relative to the bow shock vary largely for different events. In some cases the boundary is quasi-parallel to the bow shock, so they intersect with each other. However, there are also the cases with the boundary quasi-perpendicular to the bow shock. This implies that the ion holes can be generated by different mechanisms, some of which are closely related with the bow shock, but the others not. At the edges of the ion holes the density and magnetic field strength are enhanced simultaneously showing shock-like features. For some events the enhanced magnetic field is almost purely compressional, but for the others it has rotation as well as compression. The speeds of the upstream and downstream edges are not same, which represents the ion hole is not a stationary structure. We will compare the properties of several different processes like hot flow anomalies, foreshock cavities, and other nonlinear processes with those of the ion holes. This may provide better insight on the generation mechanism of the ion holes., Soil NO<SUB>x</SUB> emission from agricultural regions in the western United States has been investigated using satellite observations of NO<SUB>2</SUB> from the SCIAMACHY instrument. We show that the SCIAMACHY observations over a 2 million hectare agricultural region in Montana capture the short intense NO<SUB>x</SUB> pulses following fertilizer application and subsequent precipitation and we demonstrate that these variations can be reproduced by tuning the mechanistic parameters in an existing model of soil NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions., We report the first ever hourly in-situ measurements of speciated organic aerosol composition. Measurements were made using a novel Thermal desorption Aerosol GC/MS-FID (TAG) instrument that we developed and first deployed during the International Consortium for Atmospheric Research on Transport and Transformation (ICARTT 2004). High time resolution measurements of organic marker compounds allowed us to define several different source types contributing to the aerosols observed at Chebogue Point Nova Scotia, including two major source types from the U.S., Canadian derived aerosol, local biogenic contributions to SOA, and local primary aerosol production. Included in this analysis will be a comparison with the NOAA HYSPLIT model and wind profiler backward trajectories performed over periods of changing particle source regions. Finally, we will compare the typical summertime remote Nova Scotia organic aerosol composition and the typical wintertime urban Berkeley, CA organic aerosol composition to show how the organic fraction of aged particles differs from freshly emitted particles., An understanding of the coupling of heat and momentum sources in the troposphere and stratosphere to regions of the upper atmosphere and ionosphere is important for understanding the near-Earth space environment. Atmospheric tides are directly driven by absorption of solar energy throughout the entire atmosphere, but have major forcing terms in the lower atmosphere coming from processes such as convective heating and latent heat release by large-scale weather systems. The effects of these tides on airglow emissions in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere have been widely observed and many of their features have been well explained. Here, we present observations of a strong influence of atmospheric tides on the density and distribution of F-region ionospheric plasma at low latitudes during equinox, using observations from the TIMED GUVI and IMAGE FUV instruments during Spring 2002. These observations reveal the longitudinal and local time distribution of plasma in this region. Comparisons between these observations and the GSWM tidal model suggest a control of atmospheric tides originating in the lower atmosphere on the development of the F-region ionosphere during the daytime. These observations indicate an unexpectedly strong connection between conditions in the lower-atmosphere and the near-Earth space environment, signalling an important new view of space weather., We present measurements of the void probability function (VPF) at z~1 using data from the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe 2 (DEEP2) Redshift Survey and its evolution to z~0 using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We measure the VPF as a function of galaxy color and luminosity in both surveys and find that it mimics trends displayed in the two-point correlation function, ξ: namely, that samples of brighter, red galaxies have larger voids (i.e., are more strongly clustered) than fainter, blue galaxies. We also clearly detect evolution in the VPF with cosmic time, with voids being larger in comoving units at z~0. We find that the reduced VPF matches the predictions of a ``negative binomial'' model for galaxies of all colors, luminosities, and redshifts studied. This model lacks a physical motivation but produces a simple analytic prediction for sources of any number density and integrated two-point correlation function, ξ¯. This implies that differences in the VPF across different galaxy populations are consistent with being due entirely to differences in the population number density and ξ¯. We compare the VPF at z~1 to N-body ΛCDM simulations and find good agreement between the DEEP2 data and mock galaxy catalogs. Interestingly, we find that the dark matter particle reduced VPF follows the physically motivated ``thermodynamic'' model, while the dark matter halo reduced VPF more closely follows the negative binomial model. The robust result that all galaxy populations follow the negative binomial model appears to be due primarily to the clustering of dark matter halos. The reduced VPF is insensitive to changes in the parameters of the halo occupation distribution, in the sense that halo models with the same ξ¯ will produce the same VPF. For the wide range of galaxies studied, the VPF therefore does not appear to provide useful constraints on galaxy evolution models that cannot be gleaned from studies of ξ¯ alone., The DEEP2 (Deep Extragalactic Evolution Probe 2) distant galaxy redshift survey is nearing completion, and release of data to the community is in progress. Using the DEIMOS multi-object spectrograph on Keck II, DEEP2 has obtained spectra for 50,000 galaxies to R=24.1, mostly in the redshift range 0.7 ... 1.4 . The high spectral resolution (R &gt; approx. 5000) provides precision redshifts and galaxy kinematics, used to study galaxy evolution and mass assembly, as well as structure formation down to small scales. <P />The Extended Groth Strip (EGS) Survey is a collaborative effort to coordinate multi-wavelength observations in this popular field. The project is now a large, panchromatic survey, and includes deep coverage from various space observatories (2-band HST ACS imaging over 600 square arcmin; Spitzer; GALEX; Chandra; XMM), DEEP2 spectroscopy, and many ground-based observations in the optical, NIR and radio. We present an overview of the data, the layout and specifications of DEEP2 and the EGS Survey, give data access and contact information, and highlight recent science results., Over the first 2.5 years of operation (May 2000 to December 2002), the FUV instrument on the IMAGE spacecraft observed more than 2400 substorm onsets in the Northern Hemisphere. The list of all observed onset is published in [Frey et al., 2004]. In 2003, the fast migration of the line of apsides (50° per year) moved the IMAGE orbit apogee across the equator into the southern hemisphere. 1300 substorm onsets could be detected between the ~2.5 years of January 2003 to April 2005. Most of them were made in the Southern Hemisphere. Here we compare the major properties of the southern substorm onsets (absolute value of the onset geomagnetic latitude and MLT) with the results from the northern hemisphere. We find similar values, regardless of the different phases within the solar cycle for both data sets., The Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager ( RHESSI) has observed both high-energy electron bremsstrahlung emission and nuclear gamma-ray line emission from solar flares. The gamma-ray lines are produced when energetic ions interact with the ambient medium through various processes including neutron capture and nuclear de-excitation. By comparing electron-related emission and ion-related emission in flares, one can put constraints on the acceleration mechanism for electrons and ions. Of the gamma-ray lines, RHESSI is most sensitive to the neutron-capture line at 2.223 MeV, which is indirectly produced by protons accelerated above 30 MeV. RHESSI has observed eleven flares with significant neutron-capture line emission and can place upper limits on other flares. We compare the fluence in this line with the electron bremsstrahlung fluence above 300 keV for all RHESSI flares that extend to such energies and find strong evidence for a linear correlation between these two quantities. This correlation implies that the mechanism that accelerates protons above 30 MeV is directly associated with the mechanism that accelerates electons above 300 keV. We also look for correlations between these types of emission and soft X-ray emission as defined by GOES class. Finally, we compare these flares with flares observed in the past by the Solar Maximum Mission ( SMM) satellite. The work at the University of California, Berkeley, was supported by NASA contract NAS 5-98033., The nature of hillslope processes under abiotic, hyperarid conditions is poorly constrained, limiting our ability to understand how these landscapes form and respond to changes in climate and base level. This is particularly important as more data is collected at the Columbia Hills and other hillslopes on Mars. To address this problem, we selected two hillslopes with contrasting boundary conditions in the hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert, Chile, where biological processes relevant to hillslope evolution are absent. Despite precipitation of about 1mm/yr, one hillslope is bounded by small, actively incising channels (``active hillslope'') while the other is bounded by a stable alluvial fan of possible Pliocene age (``stable hillslope''). From the first, we can constrain the rate of bedrock erosion driven by base level lowering under hyperarid conditions, and from the second, the rate and mechanisms by which hillslopes ``relax'' in the absence of active dissection. On both hillslopes, we have measured curvature and soil thickness and are calculating bedrock erosion rates based on cosmogenic isotope analyses. These data are then interpreted using a soil mass-balance model in which soil depth is a function of soil production from physical erosion of bedrock, physical transport downslope, atmospheric deposition of salts and silicate dust, and chemical erosion. We are testing the hypotheses that: (1) active hillslope channel incision increases hillslope curvature, thins soils, and increases the bedrock erosion rate; and (2) the blanketing of stable hillslopes by atmospheric deposition of salts and silicate dust decreases curvature and thickens soils which decreases bedrock erosion rates. Our results confirm these hypotheses: preliminary calculations show bedrock erosion rates on the shoulderslope of the active hillslope of 1 m/Myr vs. 0.3 m/Myr on the stable hillslope, greater convexity on the active hillslope compared to the stable one, and consistently thicker soils on the stable hillslope than on the active one. This work is part of a larger study of hillslope pairs along a precipitation gradient in the Atacama Desert, research undertaken to both quantify hillslope soil geomorphology in the driest places on Earth and provide guidance to Mars research., The proposed macroscale substorm observations of NASA's THEMIS mission have led to a unique orbit design. Five probes, on very distinguished orbits will not only align in space but also during particular seasons and in time with ground based observations. One year from launch, we provide a comprehensive overview of the evolution of the predicted THEMIS orbits throughout the entire mission as well as an analysis of potential constellations with other missions such as CLUSTER, GEOTAIL and IMAGE. Based on current knowledge of the various substrom related phenomena we evaluate the quality of the conjunctions of the THEMIS probes., Waves in the lower-hybrid frequency range may play important roles in the reconnection onset, such as providing a source for anomalous resistivity or modifying the current profile. Such waves have been observed in current sheets in space and in the Magnetic Reconnection eXperiment (MRX) at Princeton. Here we compare the spatial distribution and beta-dependence of these waves observed in space with those observed in the lab. It is found that the waves are localized around the current sheet area and their amplitude is small at high beta. Moreover, in thick current sheets the waves are localized on the edge of the current sheet and are primarily electrostatic. However, in thin current sheets, such as the case in the MRX, the waves have a significant magnetic component and are localized in the center of the current sheet., Our search for the earliest stages of massive star formation turned up 12 massive pre-protocluster candidates plus a few protoclusters. For this search, we selected 47 FIR-bright IRAS sources in the outer Galaxy. We mapped regions of several square arcminutes around the IRAS source in the millimeter continuum in order to find massive cold cloud cores possibly being in a very early stage of massive star formation. Masses and densities are derived for the 128 molecular cloud cores found in the obtained maps. We present these maps together with near-infrared, mid-infrared, and radio data collected from the 2MASS, MSX, and NVSS catalogs. Further data from the literature on detections of high-density tracers, outflows, and masers are added. The multiwavelength data sets are used to characterize each observed region. The massive cloud cores (M&gt;100 M<SUB>solar</SUB>) are placed in a tentative evolutionary sequence depending on their emission at the investigated wavelengths. Candidates for the youngest stages of massive star formation are identified by the lack of detections in the above-mentioned near-infrared, mid-infrared, and radio surveys. Twelve massive cores prominent in the millimeter continuum fulfill this requirement. Since neither FIR nor radio emission have been detected from these cloud cores, massive protostars must be very deeply embedded in these cores. Some of these objects may actually be pre-protocluster cores: an up to now rare object class, where the initial conditions of massive star formation can be studied., We present a new technique for inferring neutral densities in the Martian upper atmosphere from atmospheric absorption of magnetically reflected solar wind electrons. Using electron loss cone measurements from the Magnetometer/Electron Reflectometer (MAG/ER) experiment on board Mars Global Surveyor (MGS), we derive upper thermospheric (~160-230 km altitude) densities in the southern hemisphere from 160° to 200°E at 2am local time, continuously from 1999 to 2005. We find a mean density of 0.027 kg/km<SUP>3</SUP> at 160 km and observe a latitude-dependent, repeatable seasonal variation of a factor of 1.8-4, with inter-annual differences and consistently lower winter densities at 50°-55°S, compared with 0°-30°S. The mean densities, overall seasonal variation and latitude dependence are in general agreement with the Mars Thermosphere Global Circulation Model (MTGCM). These measurements are important for improved understanding of the dynamics of Mars' upper atmosphere and for planning spacecraft aerobraking maneuvers., Solar gamma-ray emission provides the only available observational perspective on flare-accelerated ions near the Sun. Inelastic collisions between accelerated ions and the ambient solar atmosphere produces prompt line emission, a Doppler-broadened gamma-ray continuum as well as narrow lines due to positron annihilation (511 keV) and neutron capture (2.2 MeV). In addition to this ion-related emission, there is a significant electron-bremsstrahlung contribution from electrons accelerated to energies up to 10 MeV and beyond. The 2002 January 20 event provided one of the hardest ion and electron spectra observed to date. In this paper, we report on the results of gamma-ray imaging from ~100 keV through 7 MeV, including the gamma-ray continuum and neutron-capture line. Emphasis will be on the spatial distribution of the emission as a function of energy., Using observations from the FAST small explorer spacecraft we present fields and plasma observations above the dayside auroral oval showing the erosion of ionospheric plasmas from the topside ionosphere by the action of Alfven waves. Using interferometric techniques the waves are shown to approximately obey the expected dispersion for Alfven waves with transverse scales extending from greater than electron inertial lengths down to ion gyro-radii. Measurements of the plasma density where these waves are observed show that over latitudinal widths exceeding 100 km total depletion of the cold ionospheric plasma can occur. The plasma within these depleted regions or cavities is composed of magnetosheath ion and electron distributions and upgoing transversely accelerated ions and downgoing field-aligned electrons distributed as conics and field-aligned beams respectively. Poynting flux observations on the density gradients comprising the cavity walls show that these waves are directed downwards and focused inwards towards regions of lower density. The wave phase velocity measurement in the plasma frame, while subject to significant uncertainty, is directed transversely outwards from the cavity. These observations suggest a feedback model for Alfven wave focusing and ion heating on density gradients that can lead to intense ion outflow from the ionosphere and subsequent depletion of ionospheric plasmas., Earth's deciduous plants have a sharp order-of-magnitude increase in leaf reflectance between approximately 700 and 750 nm wavelength. This strong reflectance of Earth's vegetation suggests that surface biosignatures with sharp spectral features might be detectable in the spectrum of scattered light from a spatially unresolved extrasolar terrestrial planet. We assess the potential of Earth's step-function-like spectroscopic feature, referred to as the ``red edge,'' as a tool for astrobiology. First, we review the basic characteristics and physical origin of the red edge. Then, we discuss the challenges involved in detecting the red edge in Earthshine (i.e., a spatially integrated scattered light spectrum of the Earth), as evidenced by recent attempts to detect the red edge using spectroscopic observations of the dark side of the moon (which is illuminated by Eartshine). We present Earthshine observations from Apache Point Observatory (New Mexico) to emphasize that time variability is key to detecting weak surface biosignatures such as the vegetation red edge. We briefly discuss the evolutionary advantages of vegetation's red edge reflectance, and speculate that while extraterrestrial ``light-harvesting organisms'' have no compelling reason to display the exact same red edge feature as terrestrial vegetation, they might have similar spectroscopic features at different wavelengths than terrestrial vegetation. This implies that future terrestrial-planet characterizing space missions should obtain data that allow time-varying, sharp spectral features at unknown wavelengths to be identified. We caution that some mineral reflectance edges are similar in slope and strength to vegetation's red edge (albeit at different wavelengths). Due to the small amplitude of the terrestrial red edge, the temporal variability of atmospheric water vapor, and the potential for similar mineralogical features, we conclude that great care must be taken in the interpretation of any reflectance edges observed in the spectra of extrasolar planets., An anthropic understanding of the cosmological constant requires that the vacuum energy at late time scans from one patch of the universe to another. If the vacuum energy during inflation also scans, the various patches of the universe acquire exponentially differing volumes. In a generic landscape with slow-roll inflation, we find that this gives a steeply varying probability distribution for the normalization of the primordial density perturbations, resulting in an exponentially small fraction of observers measuring the Cosmic Background Explorer value of 10<SUP>-5</SUP>. Inflationary landscapes should avoid this “σ problem,” and we explore features that can allow them to do that. One possibility is that, prior to slow-roll inflation, the probability distribution for vacua is extremely sharply peaked, selecting essentially a single anthropically allowed vacuum. Such a selection could occur in theories of eternal inflation. A second possibility is that the inflationary landscape has a special property: although scanning leads to patches with volumes that differ exponentially, the value of the density perturbation does not vary under this scanning. This second case is preferred over the first, partly because a flat inflaton potential can result from anthropic selection, and partly because the anthropic selection of a small cosmological constant is more successful., The precession of the Polar spacecraft orbit has placed its apogee (~9 Re) near the equator during 2000-2003, allowing correlative studies of electric fields and plasmas between Polar and the satellites of the Cluster constellation (apogee ~19 Re). This has allowed us to preview the sorts of radial and azimuthal alignments planned for the inner satellites of the THEMIS mission, and to better understand the relationships between the in-situ plasma and field measurements and the ground-based signatures of substorm onset. A particularly clear example of correlated, rapid, and large-amplitude electric field fluctuations associated with strong plasma flows and ground signatures of substorm onset was observed on Polar and Cluster on 20 September 2003. This particular event has features that suggest important macro- and micro-scale ramifications of the electromagnetic fluctuations associated with substorm onset in the tail. The onset of electromagnetic fluctuations and strong flows at both Polar and Cluster are close to simultaneous, indicating a onset occurring between the two spacecraft, near 13 Re downtail. Ion temperatures Ion flows as measured by Cluster/CIS are a few hundred km/s in magnitude in a relatively high-temperature environment (~14 keV). ExB flows derived from both Polar EFI and Cluster EFW indicate much higher speed flows (1000 km/s), consistent with the observed time delays between Polar and Cluster. The relative amplitudes of the electric and magnetic fluctuations during the event indicate that significant small-scale structure below the acoustic gyroradius exists within these flows. Such small-scale structure can lead to local stochastic ion acceleration, and may also serve as a source for the observed sub-inertial perpendicular scale structure at auroral altitudes., The Mars Astrobiology Probe (MAP) is an instrument suite consisting of a subcritical water extractor (SCWE) and a sublimation system together with microchip capillary electrophoresis (CE) for extraction and analysis of potential biomarker compounds from soil. The CE instrument provides high resolution analysis of amino acid composition and chirality with ppb to part-per-trillion sensitivity (1). The CE instrument can also be used to analyze amines, diamines, amino sugars and several of the nucleobases, nucleosides and nucleotides (2). Key stages in the selection of in situ instrumentation for Mars exploration include the development of instrument suites advanced enough to operate in relevant field environments and demonstration that they have the analytical capability and sensitivity to detect low levels of biomarkers. We describe here successful field trials of MAP in the Atacama Desert in Chile, an extremely dry, oxidized environment that is an excellent Mars analog site. This work demonstrates the successful and robust operation of the MAP instrument suite in the Atacama Desert. The instruments were subjected to over 30°C temperature variations (0°C to 30°C) during a typical day of operation and the CE system performed 340 separate electrophoretic analyses on only 3 microchips in one week. We have demonstrated that the MAP instrument can detect amino acids and organic amine biomarkers in one of the driest, most Mars-like environments on Earth. In addition, based on our chirality analysis we conclude that these molecules originated from extinct living organisms. Further lab analyses of these samples are being performed to re-determine amino acid concentrations and chirality, and to analyze for culturable bacteria, fatty acids, and total organic carbon and nitrogen.

See http://astrobiology.berkeley.edu for additional details, We present spectroscopic evidence from the DEEP2 survey for a galaxy hosting a binary active nucleus at redshift z=0.71 in the Extended Groth Survey Strip. The optical spectrum shows very unusual spectral features, including very bright, double-horned [OIII] emission, with peaks separated by several hundred km/s in velocity space and approximately one kpc projected on the sky. In addition, we present imaging and flux measurements for this object across a wide range of wavelengths, from radio to X-ray. HST/ACS imaging of the host galaxy appears to show an elliptical that has recently undergone a dissipationless (gas-free) merger. Binary AGN are rare---only a few examples are known---but the study of such objects is important for understanding both the formation of cores in elliptical galaxies and the growth of supermassive black holes., Observations have shown that the Eddington ratios (the ratio of the bolometric luminosity to the Eddington luminosity) in QSOs/active galactic nuclei (AGNs) cover a wide range. In this paper we connect the demography of AGNs obtained by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with the accretion physics around massive black holes and propose that the diversity in the Eddington ratios is a natural result of the long-term evolution of accretion disks in AGNs. The observed accretion rate distribution of AGNs (with host galaxy velocity dispersion σ~=70-200 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) in the nearby universe (z&lt;0.3) is consistent with the predictions of simple theoretical models in which the accretion rates evolve in a self-similar way. We also discuss the implications of the results for the issues related to self-gravitating disks, coevolution of galaxies and QSOs/AGNs, and the unification picture of AGNs., We report the discovery of a new low-mass spectroscopic (SB2) stellar binary system in the star-forming region of Upper Scorpius. This object, UScoCTIO 5, was discovered by Ardila and coworkers, who assigned it a spectral class of M4. A Keck I HIRES spectrum revealed it to be double-lined, and we then carried out a program at several observatories to determine its orbit. The orbital period is 34 days, and the eccentricity is nearly 0.3. The importance of such a discovery is that it can be used to help calibrate evolutionary models at low masses and young ages. This is one of the outstanding problems in the study of formation mechanisms and initial mass functions at low masses. The orbit allows us to place a lower limit of 0.64+/-0.02 M<SUB>solar</SUB> on the total system mass. The components appear to be of almost equal mass. We are able to show that this mass is significantly higher than predicted by evolutionary models for an object of this luminosity and age, in agreement with other recent results. More precise determination of the temperature and surface gravity of the components would be helpful in further solidifying this conclusion., The central parsec of the Galaxy contains dozens of massive stars with a cumulative mass-loss rate of ~10<SUP>-3</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Shocks among these stellar winds produce the hot plasma that pervades the central part of the Galaxy. We argue that these stellar wind shocks also efficiently accelerate electrons and protons to relativistic energies. The relativistic electrons inverse Compton scatter the ambient ultraviolet and far-infrared radiation field, producing high-energy γ-rays with a roughly constant luminosity from ~GeV to ~10 TeV. This can account for the TeV source seen by HESS in the Galactic center. Our model predicts a GLAST counterpart to the HESS source with a luminosity of ~10<SUP>35</SUP> ergs s<SUP>-1</SUP> and cooling break at ~4 GeV. Synchrotron radiation from the same relativistic electrons should produce detectable emission at lower energies, with a surface brightness of ~10<SUP>-14</SUP>B<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>-3</SUB> ergs s<SUP>-1</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> arcsec<SUP>-2</SUP> from ~THz to ~keV, where B<SUB>-3</SUB> is the magnetic field strength in units of mG. The observed level of diffuse thermal X-ray emission in the central parsec requires B&lt;~300 μG in our models. Future detection of the diffuse synchrotron background in the central parsec can directly constrain the magnetic field strength, providing an important boundary condition for models of accretion onto Sgr A*., Evolutionary and atmospheric models have become available for young ultralow-mass objects. These models are being used to determine fundamental parameters from observational properties. TiO bands are used to determine effective temperatures in ultralow-mass objects, and together with Na- and K-lines to derive gravities at the substellar boundary. Unfortunately, model calibrations in (young) ultralow-mass objects are rare. As a first step towards a calibration of synthetic spectral features, I show molecular bands of TiO, which is a main opacity source in late M-dwarfs. The TiO \epsilon-band at 8450Å is systematically too weak. This implies that temperatures determined from that band are underestimated, and I discuss implications for determining fundamental parameters from high resolution spectra., The Multiple Instrument Distributed Aperture Sensor (MIDAS) is a diffraction-limited, wide-field imaging spectrometer that utilizes distributed apertures and optical interferometer techniques to achieve simultaneous high spatial and spectral resolution. Here we describe the results of a science and technical feasibility study of MIDAS prototypes funded under the NASA High Capability Instrument Concepts and Technology (HCICT) program as a potential science payload for missions to the outer planets and their icy satellites. The high spatial resolution capabilities of MIDAS combined with nm spectral resolution will greatly advance our understanding of icy satellite surface composition in terms of minerals, organics, volatiles, and their mixtures. From 100 km mapping orbits, cm-scale imagery from MIDAS could revolutionize our understanding of the geology, dynamics, and history of icy moon surfaces. From higher orbits, MIDAS can engage in global, high resolution imaging spectroscopy with m-scale resolution for months at a time. Beyond traditional remote sensing, MIDAS is well suited to active techniques, including remote Raman, Fluorescence, and IR illumination investigations, in order to resolve surface composition and explore otherwise dim regions., Near-infrared imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope recently revealed a circumstellar dust disk around the A star HD 32297. Dust-scattered light is detected as far as 400 AU radius, and the linear morphology is consistent with a disk ~10° away from an edge-on orientation. Here we present the first optical images that show the dust-scattered light morphology from 560 to 1680 AU radius. The position angle of the putative disk midplane diverges by ~31°, and the color of dust scattering is most likely blue. We associate HD 32297 with a wall of interstellar gas and the enigmatic region south of the Taurus molecular cloud. We propose that the extreme asymmetries and blue disk color originate from a collision with a clump of interstellar material as HD 32297 moves southward, and discuss evidence consistent with an age of 30 Myr or younger., The definition of ""electron diffusion regions"" and criteria for identifying them in magnetic field reconnection events are given. By employing these criteria and further constraints on the measured parallel electric field, 117 electron diffusion regions have been found in searching through 3 years of Polar satellite subsolar data. They exist in filamentary currents in which parallel electric fields and depressed plasma densities are found and where the electron beta is generally less than 1. The average parallel electric field in these events is about 30% of the average 38 mV/m perpendicular field. The size of these regions is the order of the electron skin depth or less. These electron diffusion regions are topological boundaries in the electron and magnetic field line flows because the components of E × B/B<SUP>2</SUP> on their opposite sides are frequently different. These regions are found throughout the magnetopause but mainly at the magnetospheric separatrix. The divergence of the pressure tensor in the Generalized Ohm's Law may be the leading term that balances the parallel electric field if the observed large plasma density variations (and hence electron pressure variations) were spatial and not temporal. The picture resulting from this data is of a magnetopause that is highly structured and filamentary and very different from a linear, laminar, symmetric structure sometimes considered in theories or simulations. However, it is emphasized that events such as those described have been found in fewer than 20% of the magnetopauses examined, so the conventional picture may be more prevalent., We present Jupiter synchrotron radiation data obtained over a period of 18 yr (1.5 Jovian yr) taken at the VLA at ~20 cm. We look at intensity, polarization, Jovicentric distance, and magnetic latitude and compare the data to a model to distinguish variations over time from variations caused by viewing geometry, i.e., changing D<SUB>E</SUB>. No obvious changes in the nature of Jupiter's intrinsic synchrotron radiation were detected other than variations in intensity from year to year. Additionally, a comparison between the data and model at all D<SUB>E</SUB> indicate that Jupiter's magnetic field is much more complex than Connerney's O<SUB>6</SUB> magnetic field model we used. Specifically, the intensity and polarization of the main radiation peaks of the model at λ<SUB>CML</SUB>~275<SUP>deg</SUP>-360<SUP>deg</SUP> show the largest deviations from the data in the main radiation peaks. Moreover, the radiation peaks in the model Jovian distances are overall farther away than in the data, which is an effect of various parameters such as the radial diffusion coefficient, the generic loss term in the diffusion coefficient, and the energy spectrum of electrons. Despite the differences between the data and model in intensity, polarization, and Jovian distance, the modeled magnetic latitude provides an excellent fit to the data., Using the first 25% of the DEEP2 Redshift Survey data, we probe the line-of-sight velocity dispersion profile for isolated galaxies with absolute B-band magnitude -22&lt;M<SUB>B</SUB>-5log(h)&lt;-21 at z=0.7-1.0, using satellite galaxies as luminous tracers of the underlying velocity distribution. Measuring the velocity dispersion beyond a galactocentric radius of ~200 h<SUP>-1</SUP> kpc (physical) permits us to determine the total mass, including dark matter, around these bright galaxies. Tests with mock catalogs based on N-body simulations indicate that this mass measurement method is robust to selection effects. We find a line-of-sight velocity dispersion (σ<SUB>los</SUB>) of 162<SUP>+44</SUP><SUB>-30</SUB> km s<SUP>-1</SUP> at ~110 h<SUP>-1</SUP> kpc, 136<SUP>+26</SUP><SUB>-20</SUB> km s<SUP>-1</SUP> at ~230 h<SUP>-1</SUP> kpc, and 150<SUP>+55</SUP><SUB>-38</SUB> km s<SUP>-1</SUP> at ~320 h<SUP>-1</SUP> kpc. Assuming an NFW model for the dark matter density profile, this corresponds to a mass within r<SUB>200</SUB> of M<SUB>200</SUB>=5.5<SUP>+2.5</SUP><SUB>-2.0</SUB>×10<SUP>12</SUP> h<SUP>-1</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> for our sample of satellite hosts with mean luminosity ~2.5L<SUP>*</SUP>. Roughly ~60% of these host galaxies have early-type spectra and are red in rest-frame (U-B) color, consistent with the overall DEEP2 sample in the same luminosity and redshift range. The halo mass determined for DEEP2 host galaxies is consistent with that measured in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey for host galaxies within a similar luminosity range relative to M<SUP>*</SUP><SUB>B</SUB>. This comparison is insensitive to the assumed halo mass profile and implies an increase in the dynamical mass-to-light ratio (M<SUB>200</SUB>/L<SUB>B</SUB>) of isolated galaxies that host satellites by a factor of ~2.5 from z~1 to z~0. Our results can be used to constrain the halo occupation distribution and the conditional luminosity function used to populate dark matter halos with galaxies. In particular, our results are consistent with scenarios in which galaxies populate dark matter halos similarly from z~0 to z~1, except for ~1 mag of evolution in the luminosity of all galaxies. With the full DEEP2 sample, it will be possible to extend this analysis to multiple luminosity or color bins., Nineteen electron diffusion regions at magnetic field reconnection sites have been found in one hour of Cluster satellite data near the subsolar magnetopause. Investigations on previously unachieved spatial and temporal scales show the following for the first time: direct conversion of magnetic energy to electron energy (The resulting accelerated electrons, their field-aligned currents, and their post-acceleration fate were measured); the spatial dimensions of the large electric fields in the electron diffusion regions have an average thickness of 0.3 times the electron skin depth, in agreement with theory; and these electron diffusion regions were topological boundaries between open and closed magnetic field geometries that contained different plasma and magnetic field line flows. The electron diffusion regions were located at the magnetospheric separatrix where the magnetic field was large and the electron beta was less than one., To investigate the hypothesis that prominences form by magnetic reconnection between initially distinct flux systems in the solar corona, we simulate coronal magnetic field evolution when two flux systems are driven together by boundary motions. In particular, we focus on configurations similar to those in the quiescent prominence formation model of Martens &amp; Zwaan. We find that reconnection proceeds very weakly, if at all, in configurations driven with global shear flows (i.e., differential rotation); reconnection proceeds much more efficiently in similar configurations that are driven to collide directly, with converging motions along the neutral line that lead to flux cancellation; reconnected fields from this process can exhibit sheared, dipped field lines along the neutral line, consistent with prominence observations. Our field configurations do not possess the ``breakout'' topology, and eruptions are not observed, even though a substantial amount of flux is canceled in some runs., We explore the use of the tangential component of weak lensing shear to characterize the ellipticity of clusters of galaxies. We introduce an ellipticity estimator, and quantify its properties for isolated clusters from ΛCDM N-body simulations. We compare the N-body results to results from smooth analytic models. The expected distribution of the estimator for mock observations is presented, and we show how this distribution is impacted by contaminants such as noise, line of sight projections, and misalignment of the central galaxy used to determine the orientation of the triaxial halo. We examine the radial profile of the estimator and discuss tradeoffs in the observational strategy to determine cluster shape., Hyperarid soils on Earth provide a framework for interpreting the growing Mars regolith database and for developing testable hypotheses for the origin of Mars soils. On Earth, dust and aerosol deposition are strongly coupled with soil formation. Long term atmospheric deposition in the Atacama Desert, coupled with small and highly stochastic rain and fog events, produce a set of soil features diagnostic of pedogenic processes and indicative of the direction of liquid water flow: (1) Extreme hyperaridity results in the retention of nearly all atmospheric inputs within the upper 3 m of the soil profile, but the infrequent rainfall events vertically separate salts by solubility, forming polygonally cracked, sulfate-cemented near-surface crusts which overlie variably concentrated layers of the more soluble chloride, nitrate, and Na-sulfate salts. (2) Pedogenic sulfates in the Atacama desert exhibit unique depth-dependent S, O and Ca isotope trends caused by isotopic fractionation during downward aqueous migration and chemical reaction. (3) Pedogenic sulfates and nitrates contain a distinctive mass independent O isotope signal indicative of a tropospheric origin, and in the case of nitrate, the retention of this signal persists only under near-abiotic conditions. Taken together, the morphology and the depth-dependent chemical and isotopic composition of hyperarid soils provides quantitative information on the origin of solutes, direction of water flow, and degree of biological activity. Depth-dependent measures of these parameters on Mars can therefore be used to test a pedogenic hypothesis for the origin of the widely distributed sulfate layers and can be used to design experiments for future missions that may more fully illuminate the history of Mars surface processes., We are currently conducting a survey of 7 years of Wind and ACE data when both spacecraft were in the solar wind. We search for reconnection flow signatures embedded in solar wind current sheets. These large-scale current sheets are ideal for the studies of the large-scale properties of reconnection. Presently, we have completed 30% of our survey and have identified 27 events when both Wind and ACE were in the solar wind and detected essentially the same reconnection signatures, irrespective of how far apart the two spacecraft were. In 5 of these cases, we have evidence for an X-line extending more than 100 Earth radii. We are aware of no counter examples where one spacecraft detected the reconnection signature and the other did not. The large number of dual-spacecraft detections of reconnection flow with no counterexamples strongly indicates that reconnection is fundamentally large scale, not patchy., The morphology and location of outflow channels on Mars indicate a subsurface origin of the water. However, the origin and processes, that can provide the large inferred discharge, is not well understood. Following previous studies, we hypothesize that dike intrusion played a significant role. The near-simultaneous discharge of magma and water, e.g., at Athabasca Valles, suggest a causal relationship between magmatism and flooding at least in some setting. We thus quantify, using numerical models the conditions, the conditions under which dikes may permit large discharges of water. We perform 2-D numerical simulations of the amount and distribution of meltwater adjacent to a cooling dike to test the hypothesis. We extend HYDROTHERM code developed by the USGS (Hayba and Ingebritsen, 1997) and include the effects of the phase transition between ice and water. We thus account for both boiling and freezing. The interaction between magma and frozen ground is assumed to occur at depths between several kilometers and a few hundred meters depth,. At the depths, boiling may occur without direct sublimation. We evaluate the melting process of the permafrost layer by estimating the following: (1) How much meltwater can be generated? (2) What is the pattern of hydrothermal circulation?, and (3) How fast does the dike cool? We vary the volume an thickness of the dike, and the permeability of the crust. We find that to generate large floods requires a large subsurface reservoir of pressurized water - melting by dikes alone is insufficient to create large floods., At high magnetic latitudes the magnetic field lines, are open and they map from the ground into the interplanetary medium. Due to the larger offset between the geographic and geomagnetic poles in the Southern hemisphere the Antarctic Continent is especially suitable for making visible wavelength optical observations of the foot of such field lines. Near the Austral winter solstice the entire polar cap, the region of open field lines are in darkness. For many years optical observation had been conducted in the Antarctica, mostly at South Pole station, with focus on studying dayside auroral phenomena that may be associated with the reconnection process between the interplanetary and the Earth's field. Although a great deal has been learned from such ground based observations, satellite based global views especially those from the IMAGE satellite proton imager, that is quite blind to dayside solar produced luminosities, contributed significantly to our understanding of the global scale morphology of the high latitude regions. Ground based optical observatory arrays are still very useful for providing the small to medium scale view of the various phenomena and the development of such array of observatories in Antarctica are still being actively pursued. Although it is not its primary purpose, the ground based THEMIS array will also be on line in the near future and it will make observations of the nightside polar cap region. In the near future there will be several arrays in operation to study the region of field lines that map from the ground into the interplanetary medium., The minimum requirement on sub-solar magnetospheric reconnection is the topological change that it produces. Energy input to the magnetosphere by the reconnection process may occur but it is not required because adequate energy to drive magnetospheric processes is provided by the Poynting flux through the tail that results from this topological change. The microphysics of reconnection is considered in terms of the ion scale of about 200 km at the sub-solar region and the electron scale of about 5 km. On the ion scale, the electric and magnetic fields required by the reconnection geometry accelerate ions to the order of the Alfven speed without the ions passing through the reconnection region itself. Examples of these fields and ion acceleration are presented. On the electron scale, it is shown that a parallel electric field is required in an electron diffusion region for reconnection to occur. Examples of such fields and electron acceleration at locations far from the classical x-line are presented., We have previously demonstrated the design, construction and testing of a portable microchip capillary electrophoresis (CE) instrument called the Mars Organic Analyzer (MOA) for analysis of amino acids and amine containing organic molecules (1). This instrument is designed to accept organic compounds isolated from samples by sublimation or by subcritical water extraction, to label the amine groups with fluorescamine, and to perform high resolution electrophoretic analysis. The CE instrument has shown remarkable robustness during successful field tests last year in the Panoche Valley, CA (1) and more recently in the Atacama Desert, Chile (2). For successful operation on Mars, however, it is necessary to operate autonomously and to analyze large numbers of samples, blanks, and standards. Toward this end we present here two advances in the MOA system that test key aspects of an eventual flight prototype. First, we have developed an automated microfluidic system and method for the autonomous loading, running and cleaning of the CE chip on the single channel MOA instrument. The integration of microfabricated PDMS valves and pumps with all-glass separation channels in a multilayer design enabled creation of structures for complex fluidic routing. Twenty sequential analyses of an amino acid standard were performed with an automated cleaning procedure between runs. In addition, dilutions were performed on-chip, and blanks were run to demonstrate the elimination of carry-over from run to run. These results demonstrate an important advance of the technology readiness level of the MOA. Second, we have designed, constructed and successfully tested a lab version of the multichannel instrument we initially proposed for the MSL opportunity. The portable Multi-Channel Mars Organic Analyzer (McMOA, 25 by 30 by 15 cm), was designed to sequentially interrogate eight radially oriented CE separation channels on a single wafer. Since each channel can be used to analyze 20 or more samples, we estimate that one microchip would be able to analyze hundreds of samples during a rover mission. The radial scanning optical system uses a stepper motor to servo the 400 nm diode laser excited confocal optical system to the desired electrophoresis channel and to collect and detect the fluorescence signal. Latching solenoids actuate a network of 32 microfabricated PDMS valves and pumps that control the microfluidic operations. A liquid cooling system maintains the entire chip at ~10 °C for optimal chiral separations. Electronic elements of the instrument are addressed by an integrated digital multiplexing chip so that the operation of the optical system, detection system, and electrophoretic voltages are controlled by a single data acquisition card. The limit of detection (LOD) of the McMOA instrument was found to be within 2x of the single channel instrument (LOD = 0.1 nM of T659, a fluorescent dye with similar fluorescent properties to fluorescamine). The sensitivity and performance of each channel was characterized by separating an amino acid standard; the peak heights and resolutions in the individual channels varied by less than 15%. Separations of biogenic amines in complex samples such as wine, sublimed bacteria, and a Miller-Urey experiment will be presented. Fluidic designs to enable the autonomous operation of the McMOA instrument and redundant microfluidic addressing of the various channels with bus structures are under development. 1. Skelley, A. M. et al. (2005) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 102, 1041-1046. 2. Skelley, A. M. et al. (2005), AGU abstract submitted., Multiple spacecraft observations of solar energetic electrons provide important information on their source, acceleration and transport through the interplanetary medium. We have identified a few electron events observed by both the WIND 3-D Plasma and Energetic Particle Investigation (3DP) and the Lunar Prospector Electron Reflectometer (LP/ER) from January 1998 to July 1999. For these events, we estimated the timing back to the Sun through transport analysis of the onset/peak times of in situ electron fluxes at different energies. For three events with good enough statistics, we also obtained solar injection time profiles from best fits to the observed time profiles of electron fluxes, assuming triangular injections at the Sun with equal rise and fall times. We found a consistent timing for solar energetic electrons observed by the two spacecrafts. We will also present the results of searching the solar electron events observed by both the WIND/3DP and the Mars Global Surveyor Electron Reflectometer (MGS/ER)., We describe a new dust logger designed to operate in water-filled IceCube boreholes in South Pole ice, and we give examples of its performance. We recorded optical effects due to bubbles, dust, and volcanic ash in situ from ~70 to 2100 meters. Seasonal layering in bubble concentration could also be discerned. Below ~1300 m over the interval 25 ka to 70 ka, because of the conversion of all air bubbles to invisible hydrate crystals, and the close match between refractive indices of the surrounding ice and the water in the borehole, scattering from dust provided fine-structure in the depth-dependence of concentration with a resolution of &lt;1 cm. Thin, highly absorptive horizons in the data set confirm there is significant fallout at South Pole of ash from explosive volcanic events. By locating and dating volcanic ash layers in the South Pole dust record, it may be possible to match them to volcanic layers found across Antarctica and in Greenland., , The Kepler Mission is a NASA Discovery mission which will continuously monitor the brightness of at least 100,000 main sequence stars, to detect the transits of terrestrial and larger planets. It is scheduled to be launched in 2007 into an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit. It is a wide-field photometer with a Schmidt-type telescope and array of 42 CCDs covering the 100 square degree field-of-view. It has a 1-m aperture which enables a differential photometric precision of 2 parts in 100,000 for 12th magnitude solar-like stars over a 6.5-hour transit duration. It will continuously observe dwarf stars from 8th to 15th magnitude in the Cygnus constellation, for a period of four years, with a cadence of 4 measurements per hour. Hundreds of terrestrial planets should be detected if they are common around solar-type stars. Ground-based spectrometry of stars with planetary candidates will help eliminate false-positives, and determine stellar characteristics such as mass and metallicity. A null result would imply that terrestrial planets are rare., We explore the effect of substructure in dark matter halos on the power spectrum and bispectrum of matter fluctuations and weak-lensing shear. By experimenting with substructure in a cosmological N=512<SUP>3</SUP> simulation, we find that when a larger fraction of the host halo mass is in subhalos, the resulting power spectrum has less power at 1&lt;~k&lt;~100 h Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> and more power at k&gt;~100 h Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>. We explain this effect using an analytic halo model including subhalos, which shows that the 1&lt;~k&lt;~100 h Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> regime depends sensitively on the radial distribution of subhalo centers, while the interior structure of subhalos is important at k&gt;~100 h Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>. The corresponding effect on the weak-lensing power spectrum due to substructures is up to ~11% at angular scale l&lt;~10<SUP>4</SUP>. Predicting the nonlinear power spectrum to a few percent accuracy for future surveys would therefore require large cosmological simulations that also have exquisite numerical resolution to model accurately the survivals of dark matter subhalos in the tidal fields of their hosts., The electromagnetic pulses (EMP) from tropospheric lightning produce transient luminous events (TLEs), known as elves, in the 80-90 km region above the lightning. The luminosity is evidence that the EMP carries sufficient electric field to excite optical emissions at these altitudes; however, it is still unknown whether the field is sufficient to ionize the atmosphere. The first multiwavelength, quantitative observatory on a free-flying satellite dedicated to observing TLEs, the Imager of Sprites and Upper Atmospheric Lightning (ISUAL) instrument on FORMOSAT-2, formerly called ROCSAT-2, confirmed that a significant number of lightning events are accompanied by elves. The instrument consists of a low light level imager and a set of multichannel photometers. In a few cases where the lightning occurred beyond the solid Earth limb, pure spectral measurements of the elves were obtained. Here we analyze such an event and show that the elves contained significant 391.4 nm emission of the N<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> ion. This is clear evidence that ionization takes place in elves. The ratio of cross sections for N<SUB>2</SUB> ionization and the production of the upper state of 391.4 nm emission is not a constant for low-energy electrons found in TLEs. We attempted to find this ratio by comparing our photometric measurements of the TLE produced emissions to theoretically derived emission intensities. The electron energy distribution and the ratios of the modeled N<SUB>2</SUB> Lyman-Birge-Hopfield (LBH) and the N<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> first negative to the second positive were computed as a function of the reduced electric field. From these ratios it was possible to obtain the reduced electric field from the ratios. We estimated that the reduced electric field, which characterizes the local electron energy distribution, was &gt;200 Td. We also made comparisons of the theoretically derived intensities to our measurements of the N<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> first positive and Lyman-Birge-Hopfield (LBH) band emission in the elves. On the basis of the ratio between the N<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> first negative emission and the time-integrated ionization production, we estimate that the elves produced an average electron density of 210 electrons cm<SUP>-3</SUP> over a large (165 km diameter) circular region having an assumed 10 km altitude extent. These observations indicate that thunderstorms are a significant source of ionization in the low- to midlatitude nighttime D region., Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) with 10<SUP>39</SUP> ergs s<SUP>-1</SUP> &lt;~ L<SUB>X</SUB> &lt; 10<SUP>41</SUP> ergs s<SUP>-1</SUP> have been discovered in great numbers in external galaxies with ROSAT, Chandra, and XMM-Newton. The central question regarding this important class of sources is whether they represent an extension to the luminosity function of binary X-ray sources containing neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes (BHs), or a new class of objects, e.g., systems containing intermediate-mass black holes (100-1000 M<SUB>solar</SUB>). We suggest searching for X-ray and optical eclipses in these systems to provide another diagnostic to help distinguish between these two possibilities. The sense of the effect is that ULXs with stellar-mass black hole accretors should be at least twice as likely to exhibit eclipses as intermediate-mass black hole systems-and perhaps much more than a factor of 2. Among other system parameters, the orbital period would follow. This would provide considerable insight as to the nature of the binary., We report the discovery of a transient radio source 2.7"" (0.1 pc projected distance) south of the Galactic center massive black hole, Sgr A*. The source flared with a peak of at least 80 mJy in 2004 March. The source was resolved by the Very Large Array into two components with a separation of ~0.7"" and characteristic sizes of ~0.2"". The two components of the source faded with a power-law index of 1.1+/-0.1. We detect an upper limit to the proper motion of the eastern component of ~3×10<SUP>3</SUP> km s<SUP>-1</SUP> relative to Sgr A*. We detect a proper motion of ~10<SUP>4</SUP> km s<SUP>-1</SUP> for the western component relative to Sgr A*. The transient was also detected at X-ray wavelengths with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory and XMM-Newton and given the designation CXOGC J174540.0-290031. The X-ray source falls in between the two radio components. The maximum luminosity of the X-ray source is ~10<SUP>36</SUP> ergs s<SUP>-1</SUP>, significantly sub-Eddington. The radio jet flux density predicted by the X-ray/radio correlation for X-ray binaries is orders of magnitude less than the measured flux density. We conclude that the radio transient is the result of a bipolar jet originating in a single impulsive event from the X-ray source and interacting with the dense interstellar medium of the Galactic center., We present a survey of six low- to moderate-redshift quasars with Chandra and XMM-Newton. The primary goal is to search for the narrow X-ray absorption lines produced by highly ionized metals in the warm-hot intergalactic medium. All the X-ray spectra can be fitted by a power law with the neutral hydrogen absorption method. The residuals that may be caused by additional emission mechanisms or calibration uncertainties are taken account by a polynomial in order to search for narrow absorption features. No real absorption line is detected at above the 3 σ level in all of the spectra. We discuss the implications of the lack of absorption lines for our understanding of the baryon content of the universe and the metallicity of the intergalactic medium (IGM). We find that the nondetection of X-ray absorption lines indicates that the metal abundance of the IGM should be smaller than ~0.3 solar abundance. We also discuss implications of the nondetection of any local (z~0) X-ray absorption associated with the interstellar medium, Galactic halo, or Local Group, such as has been seen along several other lines of sight (LOSs). By comparing a pair of LOSs we estimate a lower limit on the hydrogen number density for the (z~0) 3C 273 absorber of n<SUB>H</SUB>&gt;~4×10<SUP>-3</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>., We present the first survey of submillimeter <SUP>12</SUP>CO J=4--&gt;3 emission in the Magellanic Clouds. The survey is comprised of 15 6<SUP>'</SUP>×6<SUP>'</SUP> maps obtained using the AST/RO telescope toward the molecular peaks of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. We have used these data to constrain the physical conditions in these objects, in particular, their molecular gas density and temperature. We find that there are significant amounts of warm molecular gas associated with most of these molecular peaks and that high molecular gas temperatures are pervasive throughout our sample. We discuss whether this may be due to the low metallicities and the associated dearth of gas coolants in the Clouds and conclude that the present sample is insufficient to assert this effect., We present here the first effort to compute synthetic synchrotron polarization maps of Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe). Our goal is to highlight how polarization can be used as an additional diagnostic tool for the flow structure in the inner regions of these nebulae. Recent numerical simulations suggest the presence of flow velocities ~ 0.5 c in the surroundings of the termination shock, where most of the high energy emission comes from. We construct polarization maps taking into account relativistic effects like Doppler boosting and position angle swing. The effect of different bulk velocities is clarified with the help of a toy-model consisting of a uniformly emitting torus. We also present a map based on recent numerical simulations of the entire nebula and compare it with presently available data. The comparison with upcoming high resolution observations could provide new insight into the inner structure of the nebula and put constraints on the geometrical properties of the magnetic field., We have identified five new R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars in the Galactic bulge using the MACHO Project photometry database, raising the total number of known Galactic RCB stars to about 40. We have obtained spectra to confirm the identifications. The fact that four out of the five newly identified RCB stars are ``cool'' (T<SUB>eff</SUB>&lt;6000 K) rather than ``warm'' (T<SUB>eff</SUB>&gt;6000 K) suggests that the preponderance of warm RCB stars among the existing sample is a selection bias. These cool RCB stars are redder and fainter than their warm counterparts and may have been missed in surveys done with blue plates. Based on the number of new RCB stars discovered in the MACHO bulge fields, there may be ~250 RCB stars in the reddened ``exclusion'' zone toward the bulge., Airborne and space-based low-resolution spectroscopy in the 1980s discovered tantalizing quantitative relationships between the gas phase C/O abundance ratio in planetary nebulae (PNe) and the fractions of total far-infrared (FIR) luminosity radiated by the 7.7- and 11.3-μm bands (the C = C stretch and C-H bend, respectively), of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Only a very small sample of nebulae was studied in this context, limited by airborne observations of the 7.7-μm band, or the existence of adequate IRAS Low Resolution Spectrometer data for the 11.3-μm band. To investigate these trends further, we have expanded the sample of planetaries available for this study using Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) low-resolution spectra secured with the Short Wavelength Spectrometer and the Long Wavelength Spectrometer. The new sample of 43 PNe, of which 17 are detected in PAH emission, addresses the range from C/O = 0.2-13 with the objective of trying to delineate the pathways by which carbon dust grains might have formed in planetaries. For the 7.7-μm and 11.3-μm bands, we confirm that the ratio of band strength to total infrared (IR) luminosity is correlated with the nebular C/O ratio. Expressed in equivalent width terms, the cut-on C/O ratio for the 7.7-μm band is found to be 0.6<SUP>+0.2</SUP><SUB>-0.4</SUB>, in good accord with that found from sensitive ground-based measurements of the 3.3-μ band., Jupiter's moon Europa possesses an icy shell kilometers thick that may overlie a briny ocean. The inferred presence of water, tidal and volcanic energy, and nutrients suggests that Europa is potentially inhabited by some kind of life; indeed Europa is a primary target in the search for life in the Solar System although no evidence yet exists for any kind of life. The thickness of the icy crust would impose limits on life, but at least 15 broad kinds of habitats seem possible for Europa. They include several on the sea floor, at least 3 in the water column, and many in the ice itself. All of these habitats are in, or could be transported to, the icy shell where they could be exposed by geologic activity or impacts so they might be explored from the surface or orbit by future planetary missions. Taphonomic processes that transport, preserve, and expose habitats include buoyant ice removing bottom habitats and sediment to the underside of the ice, water currents depositing components of water column habitats on the ice bottom, cryovolcanoes depositing water on the surface, tidal pumping bringing water column and ice habitats to the near-surface ice, and subice freezing and diapiric action incorporating water column and bottom ice habitats into the lower parts of the icy shell. The preserved habitats could be exposed at or near the surface of Europa chiefly in newly-formed ice, tilted or rotated ice blocks, ridge debris, surface deposits, fault scarps, the sides of domes and pits, and impact craters and ejecta. Future exploration of Europa for life must consider careful targeting of sites where habitats are most likely preserved or exist close to the surface., We present analytic radiative transfer solutions for the spectra of unresolved, spherically symmetric, centrally heated, dusty sources. We find that the dust thermal spectrum possesses scaling relations that provide a natural classification for a broad range of sources, from low-mass protostars to dusty galaxies. In particular, we find that, given our assumptions, spectral energy distributions (SEDs) can be characterized by two distance-independent parameters, the luminosity-to-mass ratio, L/M, and the surface density, Σ, for a set of two functions, namely, the density profile and the opacity curve. The goal is to use SEDs as a diagnostic tool in inferring the large-scale physical conditions in protostellar and extragalactic sources, and ultimately, evolutionary parameters. Our approach obviates the need to use SED templates in the millimeter to far-infrared region of the spectrum; this practice, common in the extragalactic community, relies on observed correlations established at low redshift that may not necessarily extend to high redshift. Furthermore, we demarcate the limited region of parameter space in which density profiles can be inferred from the SED, which is of particular import in the protostellar community as competing theories of star formation are characterized by different density profiles. The functionality of our model is unique in that in provides for a self-consistent analytic solution that we have validated by comparison with a well-tested radiative transfer code (DUSTY) to find excellent agreement with numerical results over a parameter space that spans low-mass protostars to ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs)., We report properties of substorm-related, globally excited Alfvén waves on a temporal scale of 6 to 300 s (3.3 to 167 mHz) at geocentric distances between 5 and 6 R<SUB>E</SUB>. The waves were observed in the tail lobes and the plasma sheet boundary layer (PSBL) by the Polar satellite. In each region we made the following observations: (1) The tail lobe Alfvén waves started at substorm onset as determined from ground magnetometer data. Hence these ULF lobe waves can possibly be used as a new substorm indicator. Although on open field lines, they often showed local standing wave signatures with a large perpendicular scale size and a near-zero net Poynting flux. We do not classify those waves as FLR but interpret them as the superposition of incident and reflected waves. The same oscillations were simultaneously recorded in ground magnetometer data. Immediately poleward of the PSBL, the lobe Alfvén waves traveled earthward (no reflection), suggesting their dissipation in the ionosphere. The lobe waves were superimposed on the signature of a field-aligned current (FAC). The onset of this FAC was simultaneous to the onset of the magnetic substorm bay. (2) The substorm-related PSBL Alfvén waves carried two to three orders of magnitude larger Poynting flux (∼1 erg cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP>) than the lobe Alfvén waves. These PSBL waves were a mixture of standing and traveling Alfvén waves for different frequency ranges. Most Poynting flux was carried in large-scale earthward traveling waves (40-300 s). For one event, we also measured large standing wave components (&gt;0.5 erg cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP>), but such events are rare. In the intermediate range (40-67 s), which overlaps with the Pi2 range, some waves showed clear standing wave signatures. At smaller periods (6-24 s), noninterfering earthward and tailward traveling waves were present with small Poynting fluxes (&lt;0.05 erg cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP>). A trend for increasing E to B ratios with increasing wave frequency was observed. The PSBL waves were left-hand elliptically polarized. The wave vector was within 35° of the background magnetic field direction, suggesting that the waves were phase-mixed. The large-amplitude, substorm-related PSBL Alfvén wave events (∼1 erg cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP>) were found in regions of upward currents., We carry out numerical simulations of dissipationless major mergers of elliptical galaxies using initial galaxy models that consist of a dark matter haloes and a stellar bulge with properties consistent with the observed fundamental plane. By varying the density profile of the dark matter haloes [standard Navarro, Frenk &amp; White (NFW) profile versus adiabatically contracted NFW profile], the global stellar to dark matter mass ratio and the orbit of the merging galaxies, we are able to assess the impact of each of these factors on the structure of the merger remnant. Our results indicate that the properties of the remnant bulge depend primarily on the angular momentum and energy of the orbit; for a cosmologically motivated orbit, the effective radius and velocity dispersion of the remnant bulge remain approximately on the fundamental plane. This indicates that the observed properties of elliptical galaxies are consistent with significant growth via late dissipationless mergers. We also find that the dark matter fraction within the effective radius of our remnants increases after the merger, consistent with the hypothesis that the tilt of the fundamental plane from the virial theorem is due to a varying dark matter fraction as a function of galaxy mass., Using electron energy spectra, we identify time periods when the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft is in or above the Martian magnetic pileup boundary (MPB). We use more than five years of data to develop a statistical picture of the location of the MPB relative to the MGS mapping altitude near 400 km. We show for the first time that the MPB location is sensitive to interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) orientation and to Martian season, and confirm a dependence upon solar wind pressure. We confirm that crustal magnetic sources raise the altitude of the MPB, and demonstrate that sheath electrons populate magnetic cusp regions in the southern hemisphere. During southern summer strong crustal fields near the subsolar point raise the altitude of the MPB over the entire dayside, implying that Martian crustal fields modify the solar wind interaction globally., Ringwoodite Mg <SUB>2</SUB>SiO <SUB>4</SUB> with spinel structure is an important phase in the earth's mantle transition zone. Controlled deformation experiments showed that ringwoodite underwent ductile deformation when compressed axially at 6-10 GPa and at room temperature in a multianvil D-DIA deformation apparatus. Texture evolution during cyclic compression has been recorded in situ using X-ray transparent anvils with monochromatic synchrotron X-ray diffraction and a two-dimensional detector. Quantitative analysis of the images with the Rietveld method revealed a 1 1 0 fiber texture. By comparing this texture pattern with polycrystal plasticity simulations, it is inferred that {1 1 1}&lt; 1¯ 1 0&gt; slip is the dominant deformation mechanism in ringwoodite, consistent with high temperature mechanisms observed in other spinel-structured materials. Although strong ringwoodite textures may develop in the transition zone, the contribution to bulk anisotropy is minimal due to the weak single-crystal anisotropy., On 2001-12-02 Wind crossed the dayside magnetopause (MP) at ~15 MLT and traversed the adjacent low-latitude boundary layer (LLBL) over a period of 2 hours. The IMF was steady (northward and dawnward) during the MP/LLBL encounter. Reconnection flows were observed in the MP that were directed 130° away from the magnetosheath flow direction. In contrast, the LLBL flow was aligned with the magnetosheath flow. The counterstreaming field-aligned and anti-field-aligned electrons have different energies and their fluxes are unbalanced in the open MP whereas they are precisely balanced throughout most of the LLBL indicative of a closed LLBL. These observations indicate that reconnection occurs at the low-latitude MP during northward IMF (with a significant B<SUB>y</SUB>), but low-latitude reconnection is not responsible for the creation of the LLBL. Instead, reconnection appears to be in the process of eroding a pre-existing LLBL that was created either by diffusive entry or by non-simultaneous double-cusp reconnection., Theories of evolving quintessence are constructed that generically lead to deviations from the w=-1 prediction of nonevolving dark energy. The small mass scale that governs evolution, m<SUB>ϕ</SUB>≈10<SUP>-33</SUP>eV, is radiatively stable, and the “Why now?” problem is solved. These results rest on seesaw cosmology: Fundamental physics and cosmology can be broadly understood from only two mass scales, the weak scale v and the Planck scale M. Requiring a scale of dark energy ρ<SUB>DE</SUB><SUP>1/4</SUP> governed by v<SUP>2</SUP>/M and a radiatively stable evolution rate m<SUB>ϕ</SUB> given by v<SUP>4</SUP>/M<SUP>3</SUP> leads to a distinctive form for the equation of state w(z). Dark energy resides in the potential of a hidden axion field that is generated by a new QCD-like force that gets strong at the scale Λ≈v<SUP>2</SUP>/M≈ρ<SUB>DE</SUB><SUP>1/4</SUP>. The evolution rate is given by a second seesaw that leads to the axion mass m<SUB>ϕ</SUB>≈Λ<SUP>2</SUP>/f, with f≈M., We confirm and discuss recently discovered cold H I clouds with column densities among the lowest ever detected. The column densities of the cold neutral medium (CNM) toward 3C 286 and 3C 287 are ~10<SUP>18</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, below an observational lower limit and also below tiny-scale atomic clouds detected by VLBI and time-variable profiles against pulsars. These column densities are close to the minimum imposed by thermal evaporation. The ratios of the CNM to total H I toward 3C 286 and 3C 287 are ~4% and &lt;~2%, respectively. We discuss the CNM fraction and the CNM clouds in relation to several theoretical models., We have used cosmogenic nuclides to estimate limits on the surface exposure durations and erosion rates of alluvial fans and bedrock surfaces in the Atacama Desert in Chile. The oldest landforms we studied are extensive alluvial fans referred to as ""Atacama gravels"". With the exception of samples collected in Antarctica, the cobbles collected on these alluvial surfaces have the lowest erosion rates of any samples, as determined by cosmogenic nuclides, analyzed to date. The oldest cobble has a model surface exposure age of 9 Myr, based on combined measurements of cosmogenic <SUP>10</SUP>Be, <SUP>26</SUP>Al, and <SUP>21</SUP>Ne concentrations. Cobbles from the alluvial fans are eroding slower than the surrounding steep mountainous bedrock surfaces. Maximum erosion rates for cobbles on alluvial surfaces are uniformly &lt; 0.1 m/Myr. The survival of these gravels, specifically, and more generally, the stability of landform features in this geographic area is made possible by the attainment of hyperarid conditions in the Atacama Desert resulting from global climatic cooling about 15 Myr ago combined with the rain shadow effect caused by uplift of the Central Andes. The landform features observed presently in the Atacama Desert are remarkably stable and, despite the inevitable erosion that is detectable using cosmogenic nuclides, undoubtedly bear considerable resemblance to conditions as they existed in the Miocene. Over geologic time, the Atacama landscape is evolving in such a manner as to erode the higher bedrock ridges relative to the more stable, but stratigraphically lower depositional surfaces through which clastic detritus now travels occasionally along the floors of incised drainage systems leaving the older permeable alluvial fan surfaces largely intact as widespread remnants of a Miocene fossil landscape., The objective of this paper is to investigate whether a convective dynamo can account quantitatively for the observed lower limit of X-ray surface flux in solar-type main-sequence stars. Our approach is to use three-dimensional numerical simulations of a turbulent dynamo driven by convection to characterize the dynamic behavior, magnetic field strengths, and filling factors in a nonrotating stratified medium and to predict these magnetic properties at the surface of cool stars. We use simple applications of stellar structure theory for the convective envelopes of main-sequence stars to scale our simulations to the outer layers of stars in the F0-M0 spectral range, which allows us to estimate the unsigned magnetic flux on the surface of nonrotating reference stars. We find agreement between our G0 star calculations and the observed unsigned magnetic flux density in the quiet Sun. With these magnetic flux estimates we use the recent results of Pevtsov et al. to predict the level of X-ray emission from such a turbulent dynamo and find that our results compare well with observed lower limits of surface X-ray flux. If we scale our predicted X-ray fluxes to Mg II fluxes, we also find good agreement with the observed lower limit of chromospheric emission in K dwarfs. This suggests that dynamo action from a convecting, nonrotating plasma is a viable alternative to acoustic heating models as an explanation for the basal emission level seen in chromospheric, transition-region, and coronal diagnostics from late-type stars., Electroweak baryogenesis, given a first-order phase transition, does not work in the standard model because the quark Yukawa matrices are too hierarchical. On the other hand, the neutrino mass matrix is apparently not hierarchical. In models with neutrino mass generation at low scales, the neutrino Yukawa couplings lead to large CP violation in the reflection probability of heavy leptons by the expanding Higgs bubble wall, and can generate the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe. The mechanism predicts new vectorlike leptons below the TeV scale and sizable μ→e processes., We report on ion beams injected into the plasma sheet boundary layer (at or near the separatrix) at distances &gt;39 R<SUB>E</SUB> and up to 169 R<SUB>E</SUB> that bounced several times back and forth (up to three echoes) while remaining in coherent bunches before thermalizing in the central plasma sheet. These bouncing ion clusters (BIC) interacted with the far-tail current sheet with a possible curvature parameter, κ, of less than 2. The existence of these BIC shows that ion beams can interact several times nonadiabatically with the far-tail current sheet and still remain coherent. Owing to the large-scale E × B drift, echoes also appeared in the central plasma sheet (CPS) after several bounces. The echoes had higher energies compared with the initially injected ion cluster which can be attributed to additional nonadiabatic acceleration during their second and third interaction with the tail current sheet. After multiple bounces, the ion cluster became thermalized isotropic plasma mixing with the CPS. The three BIC events presented here were identified on the basis of the energy dispersion slopes associated with the ions. Simple model calculations showed, however, that in the case of these far-tail ion injections the 1:3:5:etc.-ratios of travel distances for echoes, used as diagnostics for near-Earth adiabatic BIC, are not valid. This is largely due to a significant shortening of the tail field lines, caused by earthward convection, during the large ion travel times. The model calculations also reproduced newly observed properties such as concave dispersion slopes for the echoes. Furthermore, we argue here that the energy dispersion of the BIC was dominated by a time-of-flight effect. The injection region for the three BIC events, determined on the basis of this time-of-flight interpretation, covered broad ranges of ΔX (GSE) = 26-40 R<SUB>E</SUB>. Two BIC events occurred during the substorm recovery phase; the other BIC event occurred during quiet geomagnetic activity. For two BIC events, UV images were available showing that they were magnetically connected to the poleward arc of the double oval. One BIC event was also conjugate to a small active region inside the poleward arc. We conclude that these nonadiabatic BIC are different from the adiabatic BIC that are routinely reported in the CPS., The He+ ion provides a valuable tracer of solar wind dynamics and the heliospheric boundary. Mapping the heliosphere in the 30.4 nm resonance line of the He+ ion with high spectral resolution will open access to the heliopause and reveal the three-dimensional flow of the solar wind. The emission fluxes are however faint, just a few mR, which poses a serious limitation on the mapping rate at high signal-to-noise ratio. We have developed a spectrometer configuration for narrowband EUV emission that offers important advantages over previous designs: high throughput (~1cps/mR), high resolution (several thousand), no moving parts, and modest instrument size and mass. The concept combines a conventional normal-incidence Rowland mount grating and an efficient multilayer coating, with a microchannel plate detector performing two dimensional photon counting. One key innovation is the use of a large-area multi-slit at the spectrometer entrance. This multislit is a one dimensional sequence of open and opaque zones, against which pattern the accumulated spectral image can be correlated to recover the incident spectrum. The other innovation is arranging that each member of the multislit group is curved in such a way that the off-plane grating aberrations (which extend and rotate the image of each object point) do not introduce significant wavelength broadening. The curved slit arrangement yields a large well-corrected image field, and a high throughput for diffuse emission is achieved. The curved-multislit Rowland spectrometer may have a variety of other applications sensing diffuse fluxes with high spectral resolution., The edge generated stray-light from corner boundary conditions, interactions with the lower mask structure, and surface plasmon polaritons that may limit Terrestrial Planet Finder Coronagraph performance are characterized. Previously a number of stray light sources, unaccounted for by the ideal thin mask theory used to design the pupil-plane masks, were identified. In this paper we illustrate and quantify the most important outstanding stray-light sources in the near-field in order to improve the model of pupil-plane mask transmission used by the Integrated Telescope Model. Corner spikes, caused by the need to bring the ideal top-hat field into compliance with the boundary conditions set forth by Maxwell's equations, form the strongest source of stray-light, accounting for up to a 1λ shift in the effective opening width per edge. Undercutting mask edges by 20<SUP>°</SUP> reduces this source of stray-light by more than a factor of five. Interactions between light and the lower mask structure, a secondary effect, account for only a few percent of the stray-light in the TE polarization but account for up to 50% of the stray-light in the TM polarization due to surface plasmon polaritons. Surface plasmon polaritons, surface waves that run for tens of microns and radiate at corners, form the final stray-light source. On thin masks they may account for up to a 1λ shift in the effective opening width; however, their effects can be easily mitigated by choosing a poor surface plasmon material, such as Chrome. The results presented here are being used to facilitate end-to-end system modeling through the Integrated Telescope Model., We flew a prototype of the Nuclear Compton Telescope (NCT) on a high altitude balloon from Fort Sumner, New Mexico on 2005 June 1. The NCT prototype is a soft gamma-ray (0.2-15 MeV) telescope designed to study, through spectroscopy, imaging, and timing, astrophysical sources of nuclear line emission and gamma-ray polarization. Our program is designed to develop and test the technologies and analysis techniques crucial for the Advanced Compton Telescope satellite, while studying gamma-ray radiation with very high spectral resolution, moderate angular resolution, and high sensitivity. The NCT prototype utilizes two, 3D imaging germanium detectors (GeDs) in a novel, ultra-compact design optimized for nuclear line emission (0.5-2 MeV) and polarization in the 0.2-0.5 MeV range. Our prototype flight was a critical test of the novel instrument technologies, analysis techniques, and background rejection procedures we have developed for high resolution Compton telescopes., Future wavefront sensors for AO on large telescopes will require a large number of pixels and must operate at high frame rates. Unfortunately for CCDs, there is a readout noise penalty for operating faster, and this noise can add up rather quickly when considering the number of pixels required for the extended shape of a sodium laser guide star observed with a large telescope. Imaging photon counting detectors have zero readout noise and many pixels, but have suffered in the past with low QE at the longer wavelengths (&gt; 500 nm). Recent developments in GaAs photocathode technology, CMOS ASIC readouts and FPGA processing electronics have resulted in noiseless WFS detector designs that are competitive with silicon array detectors, though at ~ 40% the QE of CCDs. We review noiseless array detectors and compare their centroiding performance with CCDs using the best available characteristics of each. We show that for sub-aperture binning of 6x6 and greater that noiseless detectors have a smaller centroid error at fluences of 60 photons or less, though the specific number is dependent on seeing conditions and the centroid algorithm used. We then present the status of a 256x256 noiseless MCP/Medipix2 hybrid detector being developed for AO., We propose to obtain GNIRS observations of rest-frame optical emission lines including H(beta), [OIII], H(alpha), and [NII] for 10 galaxies at 1.0&lt;=z &lt; 1.5, drawn from the DEEP2 redshift survey. These objects have precise Keck II/DEIMOS [OII] redshifts, which are essential for near-infrared spectroscopic follow-up. With a pilot sample of 5 DEEP2 galaxies, we have detected significant evolution from z=0-1 in the relationships among gas phase Oxygen abundance (Z), luminosity (L), and stellar mass (M) - fundamental metrics of the galaxy formation process. Based on emission line ratios, we also detect differences in z&gt; 1 H II region physical conditions, relative to typical star-forming galaxies at z~ 0. These results are intriguing, but we require a larger sample at z~1 to place them on a statistical footing. GNIRS in cross-dispersed mode has the unique capability to cover H(beta), [OIII], H(alpha), and [NII] emission lines simultaneously for galaxies at 1.0&lt;=z &lt; 1.5. It is therefore ideally suited to measuring the chemical abundances, physical conditions, and - with the simultaneous measurement of H(alpha) and H(beta) - dust extinction in high-redshift star-forming galaxies., SNAP is a proposed space-based experiment designed to study dark energy and alternate explanations of the acceleration of the universe's expansion by performing a series of complementary systematic-controlled astrophysical measurements. The principal mission activities are the construction of an accurate Type Ia supernova Hubble diagram (the supernova program), and conducting a wide-area weak gravitational lensing (WL) survey. WL measurements benefit from a highly constant point spread function (PSF). The goal of this study is to quantify the anticipated variations in PSF arising from on-orbit thermal variations and and shrinkage associated with dryout of the composite telescope metering structure. A combined thermo-mechanical-optical analysis tool was developed, and WL metrics whisker and effective anisotropy quantified for thermal and composite structure dryout effects. Stability limits necessary for WL are defined, and compared to stability tolerances defined for the supernova program. The mission is designed for operations at at the Earth-Sun L2 Lagrange point, where thermal disturbances from Earth are minimal. In this study, the effects of seasonal variations in solar flux, transients introduced when pointing the body-fixed Ka-band antenna toward Earth and 90° roll maneuvers (planned every three months of operations) are quantified, and introduced into the optical system. Whisker and effective anisotropy were computed, and found to be well below the WL requirement for stability. The effects of composite structure shrinkage due to on-orbit H<SUB>2</SUB>O desorption are discussed, and estimated to be below WL limits for daily observations, at the beginning of the WL phase of the mission., Microchannel plates have been used over many years in astronomical applications for X-ray, UV and visible sensing. Their adaptability to various size and configuration formats have allowed a wide range of devices to be realized, employing many different forms of readout techniques and photocathode types. One problem that has arisen for a number of these programs is the issue of obtaining high quantum efficiency on a consistent basis. Several missions have suffered from problems when microchannel plates have not achieved the quantum efficiency values that are the generally accepted normal values. We have compiled an extensive set of quantum efficiency measurements which cover missions and devices produced over the past 20 years. These show that the deficiencies in MCP QE of bare MCP's also result in a corresponding decrease in QE for same MCP's coated with a photocathode. This may be interpreted as a deficiency of the MCP detection efficiency for low energy photoelectrons produced by the MCP/cathode. Recent measurements of MCP's produced by alteration of the processing procedures shows that this problem is avoidable, and gives excellent results for current generation MCP's with 5-6 micron pore sizes., The NASA Living With a Star (LWS) Sentinels mission is presently being defined by its Science and Technology Definition Team (STDT). Sentinels is the third element of the LWS program. Its primary scientific objective is to discover, understand and model the connection between solar phenomena and the interplanetary/geospace disturbances, specifically, the heliospheric initiation, propagation and solar connection of those energetic phenomena that adversely affect space exploration and life and society here on Earth. Sentinels will play a particularly important role in support of NASA's new Vision for Space Exploration (VSE), in providing key new measurements required to understand the production of Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs) that are hazardous to human and robotic missions to the Moon and Mars. Here we describe the planning for Sentinels, and the preliminary design of the first phase, the Inner Heliosphere Sentinels, a four spacecraft mission to provide multi-point longitudinally and radially distributed in situ observations of SEPs, plasma, fields, and X-rays/gamma-rays/neutrons in the inner heliosphere (~0.25-0.76 AU), close to the site of SEP acceleration and rapid transient evolution., We identify drift-kinetic Alfvén waves in the vicinity of a reconnection X line on the Earth’s magnetopause. The dispersive properties of these waves have been determined using wavelet interferometric techniques applied to multipoint observations from the Cluster spacecraft. Comparison of the observed wave dispersion with that expected for drift-kinetic Alfvén waves shows close agreement. The waves propagate outwards from the X line suggesting that reconnection is a kinetic Alfvén wave source. Energetic O<SUP>+</SUP> ions observed in these waves indicate that reconnection is a driver of auroral ion outflow., We are developing a GaAs photoconductive detector for far-infrared (FIR) astronomy. A detector based on GaAs in the blocked impurity band (BIB) con.guration is expected to extend the long wavelegth limit of currently available stressed Ge:Ga photoconductors up to about 330 microns. Without the need of uniaxial stress applied to the crystal, this would furthermore allow the fabrication of single chip arrays with a large number of pixels. We are reporting results of the characterization of preliminary GaAs BIB test structures. The experimental work is supported by numerical modeling that includes all contact and space charge effects., Since the strength of weak gravitational lensing is proportional to the mass along the line of sight, it might be possible to use lensing data to find the masses of individual dark matter clusters. Unfortunately, the effect on the lensing field of other matter along the line of sight is substantial. We investigate to what extent we can correct for these projection effects if we have additional information about the most massive halos along the line of sight from deep optical data. We do this by calculating the contributions of these line-of-sight halos to the lensing field and then subtracting off this effect. Three different approaches are used to calculate these contributions: the first approach uses the exact mass distribution of the line-of-sight halos, the second assumes the masses are known and uses the NFW model and the third approach uses richness as an estimator for mass and then also assumes the NFW model. We find that, whichever approach we take, unless we know the masses and positions of line-of-sight halos down to a very low mass, we can only correct for a small part of the line-of-sight projection. We conclude that if we try to use lensing data to find individual cluster masses, there is an error of about 15-20% due to line-of-sight projection that cannot be corrected for., Observations of hard X-ray (HXR)/gamma-ray continuum and gamma-ray lines produced by energetic electrons and ions, respectively, colliding with the solar atmosphere, have shown that large solar flares can accelerate ions up to many GeV and electrons up to hundreds of MeV. Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are observed by spacecraft near 1 AU and by ground-based instrumentation to extend up to similar energies, but these appear to be accelerated by shocks associated with fast Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). The Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) mission provides high-resolution spectroscopy and imaging of flare HXRs and gamma-rays. Here we review RHESSI observations for large solar flares and SEP events. The 23 July gamma-ray line flare was associated with a fast, wide CME but no SEPs were observed, while the 21 April 2002 flare had no detectable gamma-ray line emission but a fast CME and strong SEP event were observed. The October- November 2003 series of large flares and associated fast CMEs produced both gamma-ray line emission and strong SEP events. The spectra of flare-accelerated protons, inferred from the gamma-ray line emission observed by RHESSI, is found to be essentially identical to the spectra of the SEPs observed near 1 AU for the well-connected 2 November and 20 January events., We present a new tomographic method based on the non-linear least-squares inversion of seismograms using the spectral elements method (SEM). The SEM is used for the forward modelling and to compute partial derivatives of seismograms with respect to the model parameters. The main idea of the method is to use a special data reduction scheme to overcome the prohibitive numerical cost of such an inversion. The SEM allows us to trigger several sources at the same time within one simulation with no incremental numerical cost. Doing so, the resulting synthetic seismograms are the sum of seismograms due to each individual source for a common receiver and a common origin time, with no possibility to separate them afterward. These summed synthetics are not directly comparable to data, but using the linearity of the problem with respect to the seismic sources, we can sum all data for a common station and a common zero time, and we perform the same operation on synthetics. Using this data reduction scheme, we can then model the whole data set using a single SEM run, rather than a number of runs equal to the number of events considered, allowing this type of inversion to be feasible on a reasonable size computer. <P />In this paper we present tests that show the feasibility of the method. It appears that this approach can work owing to the combination of two factors: the off-path sensitivity of the long-period waveforms and the presence of multiple-scattering, which compensate for the loss of information in the summation process. We discuss the advantages and drawbacks of such a scheme., The detection of cold O2+ and O+ ions in the vicinity of Saturn's rings during the Cassini Orbiter orbit insertion confirmed expectations that the rings would have a water product atmosphere and ionosphere. These observations prompted a new look at their origin and nature by Johnson et al. (2005), but also raised questions about the ionosphere's spatial distribution and fate that inspired the ionospheric model described in this report. Here a test particle model with some Monte-Carlo aspects is used to consider the behavior the O2+ and O+ ions produced in the atmosphere of Saturn's rings. Key features of these calculations include the Johnson et al. description of the production of the ring atmosphere, and the effects of the offset dipole magnetic field of Saturn. The results suggest that the latter should produce some possibly observable asymmetries in both the inner ring ionosphere and the precipitation of ring ions into the atmosphere of Saturn. Further in-situ observations of the rings are not currently planned, but remote sensing instruments on Cassini may provide future observational tests of the model., Even without Grand Unification, proton decay can be a powerful probe of physics at the highest energy scales. Supersymmetric theories with conserved R-parity contain Planck-suppressed dimension 5 operators that give important contributions to nucleon decay. These operators are likely controlled by flavor physics, which means current and near future proton decay experiments might yield clues about the fermion mass spectrum. I present a thorough analysis of nucleon partial life-times in supersymmetric one-flavon Froggatt-Nielsen models with a single U(1)<SUB>X</SUB> family symmetry which is responsible for the fermionic mass spectrum as well as forbidding R-parity violating interactions. Many of the models naturally lead to nucleon decay near present limits without any reference to grand unification., We describe the use of Externally Dispersed Interferometry (EDI) for high-resolution absorption spectroscopy. By adding a small fixed-delay interferometer to a dispersive spectrograph, a precise fiducial grid in wavelength is created over the entire spectrograph bandwidth. The fiducial grid interacts with narrow spectral features in the input spectrum to create a moire pattern. EDI uses the moire pattern to obtain new information about the spectra that is otherwise unavailable, thereby improving spectrograph performance. We describe the theory and practice of EDI spectrometers and demonstrate improvements in the spectral resolution of conventional spectrographs by a factor of 2 to 6. The improvement of spectral resolution offered by EDI can readily benefit space instruments operating from the near IR to the far UV by reducing spectrograph size or increasing instantaneous bandwidth., Titan possesses an extensive atmosphere and ionosphere that interact directly with the surrounding plasma environment (usually Saturn's magnetospheric plasma) forming an induced magnetosphere. Energetic Neutral Atoms (ENAs) are formed during this interaction when singly charged magnetospheric ions collide with exospheric neutral atoms and undergo charge-exchange. The energy of the incident ions is almost entirely transferred to the charge exchange produced ENAs, which then propagate along nearly rectilinear ballistic trajectories. ENA images are used to remotely sense the ion fluxes and spectra at the time of the charge exchange collision. They also give information about the magnetic field in the vicinity of Titan and thus to Titan's interaction with the magnetosphere of Saturn. We perform Monte Carlo test-particle simulations using the electric and magnetic fields from a 3-d MHD simulation of Titan's interaction to study the effects that Titan's induced magnetosphere has on the source region of ENAs. We examine the resulting location of ENA production and the corresponding fluxes that the Cassini spacecraft may observe. We also compare ENA results for different exospheric models., We have used the <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>39</SUP>Ar isochron technique to determine ages of 81 lunar spherules from Apollo 12 soil sample 12023. Most spherules are created in meteoroid impacts, and their ages correspond to the timing of the impacts that formed them. Of the 81 impacts we have dated, most occurred in the last 500 million years. The abundance of spherules from the most recent ~10% of the history of the Moon is consistent with an increase in the meteoroid bombardment of the inner Solar System, but does not require this explanation. The soil sample from which we extracted our spherules was from the ejecta of a recent impact; our spherule age measurements support models of lunar soil mechanics and impact cratering in which ejecta are stratified and inverted relative to the stratigraphy that was present before the impact., We conducted rapid decompression experiments using bubble-bearing viscoelastic fluid in a vertical shock tube. We varied vesicularity ϕ and pressure difference between the inside P<SUB>g</SUB> and the outside P<SUB>o</SUB> of the bubbles, Δ P = P<SUB>g</SUB> - P<SUB>o</SUB>, to understand the behavior of bubbly-magmas under rapid decompression. We find that the potential energy, which depends on the initial vesicularity ϕ, P<SUB>g</SUB>, and P<SUB>o</SUB>, determines the expansion velocity of the bubbly fluid during rapid decompression. Higher potential energy, caused by a higher ϕ and a larger Δ P, leads to faster expansion. The expansion style also depends on the vesicularity ϕ and on the pressures P<SUB>g</SUB> and P<SUB>o</SUB>. We observe five different styles of expansion during the rapid decompression that depend on ϕ and Δ P. When both ϕ and Δ P are small, ""nothing"" occurs. As ϕ and Δ P increase, the bubbly fluid reacts more violently. First, the surface of the bubbly fluid ""deforms"" and the fluid elongates in the vertical direction. For sufficient elongation the fluid can ""detach"" from the tube wall. As ϕ and Δ P continue to increase, bubble walls can break, a process we refer to as ""partial rupture"". Finally, for still larger Δ P and ϕ, both bubble walls and plateau borders break allowing the fluid to ""fragment"" into discrete pieces and erupt explosively. Our experiments show that a larger potential energy, which results from higher ϕ and larger Δ P, causes a faster expansion of magma which in turn promotes fragmentation and thus explosive eruption. If we assume that the pressure inside bubbles P<SUB>g</SUB> scales with the depth of bubbly magma, measuring the magma vesicularity in conduits or domes as a function of the depth before eruption would help assess volcanic hazard., We present a new planetary nebula, first identified in images from the Australia Telescope Compact Array, although not recognized at that time. Recent observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope during the GLIMPSE Legacy program have rediscovered the object. The high-resolution radio and infrared images enable the identification of the central star or its wind, the recognition of the radio emission as thermal, and the probable presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in and around the source. These lead to the conclusion that G313.3+00.3 is a planetary nebula. This object is of particular interest because it was discovered solely through radio and mid-infrared imaging, without any optical (or near-infrared) confirmation, and acts as a proof of concept for the discovery of many more highly extinguished planetary nebulae. G313.3+00.3 is well resolved by both the instruments with which it was identified and suffers extreme reddening due to its location in the Scutum-Crux spiral arm., We report the first scattered light detections of two debris disk around an F star and a K star using optical coronagraphy and the Hubble Space Telescope. With ages ~1 Gyr, these are the oldest debris disks thus far seen in the optical. We propose deep, multi-roll angle coronagraphic imaging with HST ACS and NICMOS to confirm and characterize the disks in terms of structure and composition. The disks appear to have belt-like morphology that is consistent with the existence of planetary companions or other perturbing bodies. Since these disks are close to our Kuiper Belt in an evolutionary context, detailed understanding of their mass, structure and composition will provide a fresh perspective for inferring the history and properties of our own trans-Neptunian region., We propose a novel HST approach to obtain a dramatically more useful ""dust free"" Type Ia supernovae {SNe Ia} dataset than available with the previous GOODS searches. Moreover, this approach provides a strikingly more efficient search-and-follow-up that is primarily pre-scheduled. The resulting dark energy measurements do not share the major systematic uncertainty at these redshifts, that of the extinction correction with a prior. By targeting massive galaxy clusters at z &gt; 1 we obtain a five-times higher efficiency in detection of Type Ia supernovae in ellipticals, providing a well-understood host galaxy environment. These same deep cluster images then also yield fundamental calibrations required for future weak lensing and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements of dark energy, as well as an entire program of cluster studies. The data will make possible a factor of two improvement on supernova constraints on dark energy time variation, and much larger improvement in systematic uncertainty. They will provide both a cluster dataset and a SN Ia dataset that will be a longstanding scientific resource., A finite-difference method for computing the first-arrival traveltimes by solving the eikonal equation in the celerity domain has been developed. This algorithm incorporates the head and diffraction wave. We also adapt a fast sweeping method, which is extremely simple to implement in any number of dimensions, to obtain accurate first-arrival times in complex velocity models. The method, which is stable and computationally efficient, can handle instabilities due to caustics and provide head wave traveltimes. Numerical examples demonstrate that the celerity domain eikonal solver provides accurate first-arrival traveltimes. This new method is three times accurate more than the second-order fast marching method in a linear velocity model with the same spacing., The Sun and roughly 15% of stars are surrounded by dust disks collisionally replenished by asteroids and comets. Disk structure can be directly tied to the dynamical influence of more massive bodies such as planets. For example, planetary perturbations offset the center of our zodiacal dust disk 0.01 AU away from the Sun and also maintain a 40 AU radius inner edge to our Kuiper Belt. Here we propose follow-up observation to the first optical detection of reflected light from dust grains surrounding the nearby star Fomalhaut using HST/ACS. We find a belt of material between 133 and 158 AU radius that has a center position offset 15 AU from the stellar position, and with a sharp inner edge. A tenuous dust component interior to the belt is also detected in the southeast. Given Fomalhaut's proximity to the Sun {7.7 pc}, these images represent the closest and highest angular resolution view of an extrasolar analog to our Kuiper Belt. The center of symmetry offset and the sharp inner edge of Fomalhaut's belt are evidence for planet-mass objects orbiting the star as predicted by dynamical theory and simulations. We propose comprehensive follow-up ACS imaging to fully exploit this discovery and map the disk around its entire circumference with higher signal-to-noise and at multiple wavelengths. HST/ACS is certainly the only facility capable of performing this relatively wide field optical study at high contrast ratios and diffraction-limited resolution. The Cycle 14 data will provide key measurements of belt width as a function of azimuth, the scattered light color of the belt versus the inner dust component, and the azimuthal structure of the belt. These data will be used to constrain dynamical models of resonances and shepherding that ultimately elucidate the dynamical properties of planet-mass objects in the system., Energy spectra of electron microbursts in the energy range 170-360 keV have been measured in the outer radiation zone by the low-altitude (680 km), polar-orbiting Korean satellite STSAT-1. These electrons are the lower energy population of relativistic microbursts. Our observations show microburst energy spectra of precipitated electrons inside the loss cone (precipitated) have higher e-folding energies during disturbed times than quiet times. The loss cone at these energies is empty except when microbursts abruptly appear and fill the loss cone in less than 50 msec. This fast pitch angle diffusion requires diffusion coefficients larger than ~3.5 × 10<SUP>-2</SUP> rad<SUP>2</SUP>/sec, while ~1.5 × 10<SUP>-5</SUP> rad<SUP>2</SUP>/sec was proposed by a wave particle interaction theory. The source of microbursts remains unknown as our observations are not adequately explained by wave and particle resonant interaction models., This week {March 6} a new red spot on Jupiter was announced, dubbed ""Red Spot Jr.'' by the press. It appears to be White Oval BA, the remanant of the three White Ovals that merged during 1998-2000. The new spot is deep red like the Great Red Spot {GRS} rather than bright white as were the ovals. We believe that the color change of the oval from white to red is indicative of a temperature change, as predicted by one of us in a Nature paper in 2004. The goalof our proposed observations is to test our theory of jovian climate change through observations of dynamical features of Red Spot Jr. and its surroundings, which provide indirect measurements of changes in the temperature and stratification of the jovian weather layer., In a search for new Galactic planetary nebulae from our systematic scans of the Anglo-Australian Observatory/United Kingdom Schmidt Telescope (AAO/UKST) Hα Survey of the Southern Galactic Plane, we have identified a Population I Wolf-Rayet star of type WN7h associated with an unusual ring nebula that has a fractured rim. We present imagery in Hα, the 843-MHz continuum from the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (MOST), the mid-infrared from the Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX), and confirmatory optical spectroscopy of the character of the nebula and of its central star. The inner edge of the Hα shell shows gravitational instabilities with a well-defined wavelength around its complete circumference., We explore the description of bulk causal structure in a dual field theory. We observe that in the spacetime dual to a spacelike non-commutative field theory, the causal structure in the boundary directions is modified asymptotically. We propose that this modification is described in the dual theory by a modification of the micro-causal light cone. Previous studies of this micro-causal light cone for spacelike non-commutativite field theories agree with the expectations from the bulk spacetime. We describe the spacetime dual to field theories with lightlike non-commutativity, and show that they generically have a drastic modification of the light cone in the bulk: the spacetime is non-distinguishing. This means that the spacetime while being devoid of closed timelike or null curves, has causal curves that are ``almost closed''. We go on to show that the micro-causal light cone in the field theory agrees with this prediction from the bulk., The Imager for Sprites and Upper Atmospheric Lightning (ISUAL) on the Taiwanese FORMOSAT-2 (formerly ROCSAT-2) spacecraft is the first global observatory of transient luminous events (TLEs). During the first 4 months of operation a large number of elves were observed. Elves are obvious with their far ultraviolet (FUV) signature that is less attenuated by atmospheric O<SUB>2</SUB> at their emission altitude compared to emission from sprites or lightning at lower altitude. About half of all elves were produced by lightning that shows a three-step signature in the photometer signal: (1) An initial brightening in all except the FUV channels, (2) a slow brightness decrease for the next 2-5 milliseconds, and (3) an impulsive increase of signal in all channels. We interpret this specific signature as the initial breakdown with a beta-type stepped leader followed by the bright return stroke of a negative cloud to ground (-CG) lightning. In contrast, sprites follow positive cloud to ground lightning (+CG) without a signature of initial breakdown and stepped leader. Many sprites are associated with the continuing current and can be delayed up to 100 ms after the lightning., We present in this Keck AO paper the first global high angular resolution observations of Io in three broadband near-infrared filters: Kc (2.3 μm), Lp (3.8 μm), and Ms (4.7 μm). The Keck AO observations are composed of 13 data sets taken during short time intervals spanning 10 nights in December, 2001. The MISTRAL deconvolution process, which is specifically aimed for planetary images, was applied to each image. The spatial resolution achieved with those ground-based observations is 150, 240, and 300 km in the Kc, Lp, and Ms band, respectively, making them similar in quality to most of the distant observations of the Galileo/NIMS instrument. Eleven images per filter were selected and stitched together after being deprojected to build a cylindrical map of the entire surface of the satellite. In Kc-band, surface albedo features, such as paterae ( R&gt;60 km) are easily identifiable. The Babbar region is characterized by extremely low albedo at 2.2 μm, and shows an absorption band at 0.9 μm in Galileo/SSI data. These suggest that this region is covered by dark silicate deposits, possibly made of orthopyroxene. In the Lp-Ms (3-5 μm) bands, the thermal emission from active centers is easily identified. We detected 26 hot spots in both broadband filters over the entire surface of the minor planet; two have never been seen active before, nine more are seen in the Ms band. We focused our study on the hot spots detected in both broadband filters. Using the measurements of their brightness, we derived the temperature and area covered by 100 brightness measurements. Loki displayed a relatively quiescent activity. Dazhbog, a new eruption detected by Galileo/NIMS in August 2001, is a major feature in our survey. We also point out the fading of Tvashtar volcanic activity after more than two years of energetic activity, and the presence of a hot, but small, active center at the location of Surt, possibly a remnant of its exceptional eruption detected in February 2001. Two new active centers, labeled F and V on our data, are detected. Using the best temperature and the surface area derived from the L and M band intensities, we calculated the thermal output of each active center. The most energetic hot spots are Loki and Dazhbog, representing respectively 36 and 19% of the total output calculated from a temperature fit of all hot spots ( 20.6×10 W). Based on the temperature derived from hot spots (∼400 K), our measurement can unambiguously identify the contribution to the heat flux from the silicate portion of the surface. Because the entire surface was observed, no extrapolation was required to calculate that flux. It is also important to note that we measured the brightness of the individual hot spots when they were located close to the Central Meridian. This minimizes the line-of-sight effect which does not follow strictly a classical cosine law. Finally, we argue that despite the widespread volcanic activity detected, Io was relatively quiescent in December 2001, with a minimum mean total output of 0.4-1.2 W m <SUP>-2</SUP>. This output is at least a factor of two lower than those inferred from observations made at longer wavelengths and at different epochs., The San Juan Bautista (SJB) segment forms the northern transition zone of the creeping section of the San Andreas fault. It is an area of moderate seismicity; the largest instrumentally-recorded earthquakes have been M5.5. However, historic records suggest six M &gt;= 6 earthquakes occurred near the SJB segment between 1840 and 1899. It is also an area that has experienced several slow earthquakes. We perform a joint inversion of GPS and InSAR data to determine the current rate and distribution of interseismic creep. We find two low-slip/locked segments at mid-seismogenic depths that may represent source regions for the 19th century earthquakes. We find that the SJB segment is currently accumulating strain energy at the rate of one M6.3-6.7 earthquake per century. At this rate, the 1840-1899 sequence released 135-510 years of accumulated moment deficit., The problem of accretion in the Trojan 1:1 resonance is akin to the standard problem of planet formation, transplanted from a star-centered disk to a disk centered on the Lagrange point. The newly discovered class of Neptune Trojans promises to test theories of planet formation by coagulation. Neptune Trojans resembling the prototype 2001 QR<SUB>322</SUB> (``QR'')-whose radius of ~100 km is comparable to that of the largest Jupiter Trojan-may outnumber their Jovian counterparts by a factor of ~10. We develop and test three theories for the origin of large Neptune Trojans: pull-down capture, direct collisional emplacement, and in situ accretion. These theories are staged after Neptune's orbit anneals, that is, after dynamical friction eliminates any large orbital eccentricity and after the planet ceases to migrate. We discover that seeding the 1:1 resonance with debris from planetesimal collisions and having the seed particles accrete in situ naturally reproduces the inferred number of QR-sized Trojans. We analyze accretion in the Trojan subdisk by applying the two-groups method, accounting for kinematics specific to the resonance. We find that a Trojan subdisk comprising decimeter-sized seed particles and having a surface density ~10<SUP>-3</SUP> times that of the local minimum-mass disk produces ~10 QR-sized objects in ~1 Gyr, in accord with observation. Further growth is halted by collisional diffusion of seed particles out of resonance. In our picture, the number and sizes of the largest Neptune Trojans represent the unadulterated outcome of dispersion-dominated, oligarchic accretion. Large Neptune Trojans, perhaps the most newly accreted objects in our solar system, may today have a dispersion in orbital inclination of less than ~10°, despite the existence of niches of stability at higher inclinations. Such a vertically thin disk, born of a dynamically cold environment necessary for accretion and raised in minimal contact with external perturbations, contrasts with the thick disks of other minor body belts., I present an empirical model for predicting a star's radial velocity jitter from its B-V color, activity level, and absolute magnitude. This model is based on observations of ~450 well-observed stars from Keck Observatory for the California and Carnegie Planet Search Program. The model includes noise from both astrophysical sources and systematic errors, and describes jitter as generally increasing with a star's activity and height above the main sequence. <P />Based on observations obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated jointly by the University of California and the California Institute of Technology. The Keck Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation., We show that combining observations of ultraviolet source variability by the NASA Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) satellite with color selections from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is an effective tool for identifying RR Lyrae stars. The method is used here to identify 11 previously unknown RR Lyrae stars, in the absence of light curves., Earth's Moon, lacking both a global magnetic field and any significant atmosphere, presents an ideal location to study plasma flow past a solar system body in one of its simplest incarnations. Despite its relative simplicity, however, the lunar wake interaction displays a rich array of physics, with both fluid and kinetic aspects. We present a new study of the lunar wake, using measurements from Lunar Prospector (LP) to determine the magnetic field, electron density and temperature, and electrostatic potential. We use these data and Wind key parameter data to characterize the wake near the Moon. At 85-115 km above the Moon we observe a ""classical"" wake signature, with enhanced magnetic fields in the central wake and reduced fields near the boundary. The magnetic signature at these altitudes responds clearly to changes in solar wind parameters, while that at 20-45 km depends mainly on crustal fields. We also observe an ambipolar potential drop across the wake boundary (resulting in central wake potentials of about -300 V relative to the solar wind) and greatly reduced electron density and increased electron temperature in the wake. The wake morphology, in terms of both electron parameters and magnetic fields, is well described by self-similar solutions for plasma expansion into a void and the resulting diamagnetic current system, but only if Kappa functions are used to describe the solar wind electron distributions., Phosphorus is one of the nutrients most commonly limiting net primary production in soils of humid tropical forests, mainly because insoluble Al and Fe phosphates and strong sorption to Fe(III) (hydr)oxides remove P from the bioavailable pool. Recent field studies have suggested, however, that this loss may be balanced by organic P accumulation under a wet moisture regime (&gt;3350 mm annual precipitation). It has been hypothesized that, as the moisture regime changes from dry to mesic to wet, periods of anoxic soil conditions increase in intensity and duration, depleting Fe(III) (hydr)oxides and releasing sorbed P, but also slowing organic matter turnover, thus shifting the repository of soil P from minerals to humus. Almost no quantitative information is available concerning the coupled biogeochemical behavior of Fe and P in highly weathered forest soils that would allow examination of this hypothesis. In this paper, we report a laboratory incubation study of the effects of biotic Fe(III) (hydr)oxide reduction on P solubilization in a humid tropical forest soil (Ultisol) under a wet moisture regime (3000-4000 mm annual rainfall). The objectives of our study were: (1) to quantify Fe(III) reduction and P solubilization processes in a highly weathered forest soil expected to typify the hypothesized mineral dissolution-organic matter accumulation balance; (2) to examine the influence of electron shuttling on these processes using anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS), a well-known surrogate for the semiquinone electron shuttles in humic substances, as an experimental probe; and (3) to characterize the chemical forms of Fe(II) and P produced under anoxic conditions, both with and without AQDS. Two series of short-term incubation experiments were carried out, one without AQDS and another with an initial AQDS concentration of 150 μM. We measured pH, pE, and the production of Fe(II), total Fe [Fe(II) + Fe(III)], inorganic P, total P (inorganic P + organic P), and biogenic gases (CO <SUB>2</SUB>, H <SUB>2</SUB> and CH <SUB>4</SUB>). The same positive correlation was found between soluble P release and soluble Fe(II) production throughout incubation, implying that reduction of Fe(III) solubilized P. The Fe(II) produced was mainly particulate, evidently due to the formation of Fe(II) solid phases. Thermodynamic calculations indicated that precipitation of siderite and, in the presence of AQDS, vivianite was favored under the anoxic conditions that developed rapidly in the soil suspensions. Inorganic soluble P released during incubation was very small, indicating that the soluble P produced was mainly in organic form, which is consistent with the hypothesis that P accumulates in soil humus. Our net CO <SUB>2</SUB> production, H <SUB>2</SUB> consumption, and Fe(II) production data all suggested that reductive dissolution of Fe(III) (hydr)oxides was a terminal electron-accepting process coupled both to H <SUB>2</SUB> consumption and organic C oxidation by the native population of microorganisms in the soil. Addition of AQDS accelerated the production of Fe(II) and the release of soluble P, while hastening the decline in H <SUB>2</SUB> gas levels and suppressing CH <SUB>4</SUB> production. However, throughout incubation, the same quantitative relationships between soluble Fe(II) and P, and between pE and pH, were found, irrespective of AQDS addition. Thus we conclude that, in our soil incubation experiments, added AQDS functioned with the native microbial population solely as an electron shuttle catalyzing Fe(III) reduction. Whether humic substances in the soil also can act as electron shuttles in this way is a matter for future investigation., Observations of solar wind electron distribution functions (VDFs) reveal considerable deviations from a simple Maxwellian VDF. A thermal core and a suprathermal halo and antisunward, magnetic field-aligned beam, or ``strahl,'' can be distinguished. At higher energies above 2 keV, a superhalo can even be observed. A kinetic description of electrons in the solar corona and wind, including resonant interaction between electrons and whistler waves, can reproduce an enhancement of suprathermal electron fluxes compared to the core flux. The whistler waves are assumed to be generated below the solar coronal base and propagate through the corona into interplanetary space. However, the resonance condition with these whistlers can only be fulfilled by electrons that move sunward. For antisunward-moving electrons, such a model lacks an efficient diffusion mechanism. The mirror force due to the opening magnetic field geometry of a solar coronal hole and in the solar wind focuses the electrons into a very narrow beam. This expectation of an extremely narrow beam is contradicted by observations of a ``strahl'' that has a finite width, and of an quasi-isotropic superhalo component. Thus, a diffusion mechanism for antisunward-moving electrons must exist in interplanetary space. In this paper, antisunward-propagating whistler waves are introduced into the kinetic model in order to provide this diffusion. Their wave power is estimated as a small fraction of the total wave power that is measured in interplanetary space. The kinetic results show that the whistler waves are capable of influencing the solar wind electron VDFs significantly, leading to the formation of both the halo and strahl populations and a more isotropic distribution at higher energies, in good agreement with solar wind observations., We present a new survey for CO in dwarf galaxies using the ARO Kitt Peak 12 m telescope. This survey consists of observations of the central regions of 121 northern dwarfs with IRAS detections and no known CO emission. We detect CO in 28 of these galaxies and marginally detect another 16, increasing by about 50% the number of such galaxies known to have significant CO emission. The galaxies we detect are comparable in stellar and dynamical mass to the Large Magellanic Cloud, although somewhat brighter in CO and fainter in the far-IR. Within dwarfs, we find that the CO luminosity L<SUB>CO</SUB> is most strongly correlated with the K-band and the far-infrared luminosities. There are also strong correlations with the radio continuum (RC) and B-band luminosities and linear diameter. Conversely, we find that far-IR dust temperature is a poor predictor of CO emission within the dwarfs alone, although a good predictor of normalized CO content among a larger sample of galaxies. We suggest that L<SUB>CO</SUB> and L<SUB>K</SUB> correlate well because the stellar component of a galaxy dominates the midplane gravitational field and thus sets the pressure and density of the atomic gas, which control the formation of H<SUB>2</SUB> from H I. We compare our sample with more massive galaxies and find that dwarfs and large galaxies obey the same relationship between CO and the 1.4 GHz RC surface brightness. This relationship is well described by a Schmidt law with Σ<SUB>RC</SUB>~Σ<SUP>1.3</SUP><SUB>CO</SUB>. Therefore, dwarf galaxies and large spirals exhibit the same relationship between molecular gas and star formation rate (SFR). We find that this result is robust to moderate changes in the RC-to-SFR and CO-to-H<SUB>2</SUB> conversion factors. Our data appear to be inconsistent with large (order of magnitude) variations in the CO-to-H<SUB>2</SUB> conversion factor in the star-forming molecular gas., We have obtained high-quality Keck optical spectra at three epochs of the Type Ia supernova 1997ex, whose redshift z is 0.361. The elapsed calendar time between the first two spectra was 24.88 days, and that between the first and third spectra was 30.95 days. In an expanding universe where 1+z represents the factor by which space has expanded between the emission and detection of light, the amount of aging in the supernova rest frame should be a factor of 1/(1+z) smaller than the observed-frame aging; thus, we expect SN 1997ex to have aged 18.28 and 22.74 days between the first epoch and the second and third epochs, respectively. The quantitative method for determining the spectral-feature age of an SN Ia reveals that the corresponding elapsed times in the supernova rest frame were 16.97+/-2.75 and 18.01+/-3.14 days, respectively. This result is inconsistent with no time dilation with a significance level of 99.0%, providing evidence against ``tired light'' and other hypotheses in which no time dilation is expected. Moreover, the observed timescale of spectral evolution is inconsistent with that expected in the ``variable mass theory.'' The result is within ~1 σ of the aging expected from a universe in which redshift is produced by cosmic expansion., On Earth, large earthquakes commonly cause saturated soils to liquefy and streamflow to increase. We suggest that meteoritic impacts on Mars may have repeatedly caused similar liquefaction to enable violent eruption of groundwater. The amount of erupted water may be comparable to that required to produce catastrophic floods and to form outflow channels., Two end-member geometries, radial flow and ridge-channeled flow, have been proposed for the dispersion of material upwelling beneath Iceland. Seismic anisotropy provides information on mantle flow, and therefore has the potential to discriminate these two geometries. In this study, we combine the HOTSPOT and SIL datasets (39 stations) and select 28 events for teleseismic shear-wave splitting analysis. Splitting results in central and eastern Iceland show 1-2 s splitting times with an average NNW-SSE orientation of the fast splitting direction and an anti-clockwise rotation of fast axes from east to central Iceland. In western Iceland, smaller splits with more N-S orientations are observed. Since crustal splitting times in Iceland are 0.1 s to 0.3 s, our delays of up to 2 s indicate a mantle source. Both the lack of dependence of the splitting parameters on event back azimuth and the observations of null splits for events where the back azimuth is parallel or perpendicular to the fast splitting directions (observed using other events) suggest that one layer of anisotropy dominates beneath Iceland. While both high stress plus enriched water content and melt-rich layers can result in a 90° rotation of the fast splitting direction with respect to the flow direction, we interpret our fast axis orientation as pointing in the direction of flow as the magnitude of stress is low and the amount and geographical extent of melt are likely small beneath Iceland. The observed anisotropy pattern beneath Iceland is inconsistent with radial flow away from the upwelling. Instead we propose a ridge-channeled flow model in which there is horizontal flow of material away from the upwelling axis beneath southeast Iceland toward the southern end of the Kolbeinsey Ridge and the northern end of the Reykjanes Ridge, both of which are west of the upwelling. This geometry is similar to the ridge perpendicular flow predicted for off-ridge hotspots towards the ridge. We hypothesize that upwelled material then feeds ridge parallel asthenospheric channels beneath the North Atlantic Ridge. Our interpretation is thus consistent with generation of V-shaped ridges by channeling of upwelling material down the Reykjanes and Kolbeinsey ridges., Diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) have been detected for the first time along the peculiar translucent line of sight toward HD 62542, which passes through a diffuse cloud core. Although only a small fraction (18 out of more than 300) of generally weak DIB features have been shown to correlate with C<SUB>2</SUB> and C<SUB>3</SUB> (the ``C<SUB>2</SUB> DIBs''), it is predominantly these DIBs that are observed toward HD 62542. The typically strong DIBs λλ5780 and 5797 are detected but are significantly weaker than toward other lines of sight with similar reddening. Other commonly observed DIBs (such as λλ4430, 6270, and 6284) remain noticeably absent. These observations further support the suggestion that the line of sight toward HD 62542 crosses only the core of a diffuse cloud and show that the correlation between the C<SUB>2</SUB> DIBs and small carbon chains is maintained in environments with very large fractions of molecular hydrogen, f<SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB></SUB>&gt;0.8. A comparison of CH, CN, C<SUB>2</SUB>, and C<SUB>3</SUB> column densities and C<SUB>2</SUB> DIB strengths toward HD 62542, HD 204827, and HD 172028 suggests that the line of sight toward HD 204827 passes through a diffuse cloud core similar to that seen toward HD 62542, as well as what might be referred to as a diffuse cloud envelope. This indicates that the bare core toward HD 62542 may not have significantly different relative chemical abundances from other diffuse cloud cores and that the C<SUB>2</SUB> DIBs may serve as a diagnostic of such cores., As part of a larger project to complete a comprehensive catalog of astrophysically relevant emission lines in support of new-generation X-ray observatories using the Lawrence Livermore electron beam ion traps EBIT-I and EBIT-II, we present observations of sulfur lines in the soft X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet regions. Our database includes wavelength measurements with standard errors, relative intensities, and line assignments for 127 transitions of S VII through S XIV between 20 and 75 Å. The experimental data are complemented with a full set of calculations using the Hebrew University Lawrence Livermore Atomic Code (HULLAC). A comparison of the laboratory data with Chandra measurements of Procyon allows us to identify S VII-S XI lines., We have observed pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) in the three supernova remnants G11.2-0.3, G16.7+0.1, and G29.7-0.3 at 89 GHz with the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association array, measuring total flux densities of two of them for comparison with archival data at other frequencies. In G16.7+0.1, we find a break in the spectrum of the PWN at ~26 GHz. In G29.7-0.3, our data suggest a break in the integrated spectrum of the central nebula at ~55 GHz, lower than previously estimated. However, we have found spatial structure in the spectrum of this nebula. The emission to the north of pulsar J1846-0258 has a broken spectrum with break frequency &lt;~100 GHz, consistent with a conventional pulsar-powered nebula. The emission to the south of the pulsar has a nearly power-law spectrum from radio to X-rays: this component may be unrelated to the PWN, or it may be evidence of asymmetries and/or time evolution in the pulsar's energy output. We present 89 GHz images of each remnant., We present the first interferometric observations of linearly polarized emission toward the OMC-3 region of the Orion A cloud. We have observed the MMS 6 protostellar core at 1.3 mm with the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association (BIMA) array, achieving a resolution of 4.3""×3.0"". We find that the polarization angle measured changes systematically across the core, orienting along a dust extension to the northwest. The polarization angle is oriented similarly to the 850 and 350 μm polarized emission measured by the SCUBA and Hertz polarimeters. A polarization hole is detected, as is typical of polarized emission data toward cores. Since the BIMA data are insensitive to structure on spatial scales of &gt;40"", the emission detected is dominated by the core and not the integral-shaped filament in which it is embedded. Observations of CO J=2-1 reveal CO emission potentially associated with the core, but no outflow signature is detected. Utilizing the Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, we have used the dispersion in the polarization vectors to estimate a field strength of 640 μG in the plane of the sky, assuming a corrective Q-factor of 0.5. Applying the recent measurement of the inclination of the field to the line of sight (Houde et al.), a total field strength of 680 μG is derived. Despite highly nonthermal line widths, the kinetic energy density is found to be insufficient to support this core against gravitational collapse. The magnetic energy density, when combined with the predominantly turbulent kinetic energy density, is comparable to the effects of gravity, but its value is highly dependent on the applied Q-factor to a degree that the core may be subcritical or supercritical. The preservation of the field geometry from large to small scales in this core is consistent with observations of a second protostellar core in a filamentary cloud in Orion B., We present the broadband UV through mid-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of a sample of 72 spectroscopically confirmed star-forming galaxies at z=2.30+/-0.3. Located in a 72 arcmin<SUP>2</SUP> field centered on the bright background QSO, HS 1700+643, these galaxies were preselected to lie at z~2 solely on the basis of their rest-frame UV colors and luminosities and should be representative of UV-selected samples at high redshift. In addition to deep ground-based photometry spanning from 0.35 to 2.15 μm, we make use of Spitzer IRAC data, which probe the rest-frame near-IR at z~2. The range of stellar populations present in the sample is investigated with simple, single-component stellar population synthesis models. The inability to constrain the form of the star formation history limits our ability to determine the parameters of extinction, age, and star formation rate without using external multiwavelength information. Emphasizing stellar mass estimates, which are much less affected by these uncertainties, we find &lt;logM<SUB>*</SUB>/M<SUB>solar</SUB>&gt;=10.32+/-0.51 for the sample. The addition of Spitzer IRAC data as a long-wavelength baseline reduces stellar mass uncertainties by a factor of 1.5-2 relative to estimates based on optical-K<SUB>s</SUB> photometry alone. However, the total stellar mass estimated for the sample is remarkably insensitive to the inclusion of IRAC data. We find correlations between stellar mass and rest-frame R band (observed K<SUB>s</SUB>) and rest-frame 1.4 μm (observed 4.5 μm) luminosities, although with significant scatter. Even at rest-frame 1.4 μm, the mass-to-light ratio varies by a factor of 15 indicating that even the rest-frame near-IR, when taken alone, is a poor indicator of stellar mass in star-forming galaxies at z~2. Allowing for the possibility of episodic star formation, we find that typical galaxies in our sample could contain up to 3 times more stellar mass in an old underlying burst than what was inferred from single-component modeling. In contrast, mass estimates for the most massive galaxies in the sample (M<SUB>*</SUB>&gt;10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>) are fairly insensitive to the method used to model the stellar population. Galaxies in this massive tail, which are also the oldest objects in the sample, could plausibly evolve into the passive galaxies discovered at z~1.7 with near-IR selection techniques. In the general framework of hierarchical galaxy formation and mergers, which implies episodic star formation histories, galaxies at high redshift may pass in and out of UV-selected and near-IR color-selected samples as they evolve from phases of active star formation to quiescence and back again. <P />Based, in part, on data obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA, and was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation., Titan's interaction with Saturn's magnetosphere is studied using a combination of a three-dimensional (3-D) single-fluid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation and a test particle/Monte Carlo model. The MHD simulation includes an exosphere model based on the one used in the work of Cravens et al. (1998), simple ionospheric processes such as ion production, ion-neutral friction and dissociative recombination and provides a general picture of Titan's plasma environment. The fields from the MHD simulation are then used to calculate the trajectories of 1.4 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> ions. We calculate the velocity space distribution and differential energy flux for ambient H<SUP>+</SUP> and N<SUP>+</SUP> ions and for three generic species of pickup ions found upstream of, and within, Titan's plasma wake. The three generic pickup ion species we use are: light (e.g., H<SUP>+</SUP> or H<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>+</SUP>), medium (e.g., N<SUP>+</SUP>, CH<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>+</SUP>, or CH<SUB>5</SUB><SUP>+</SUP>), and heavy (e.g., N<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>+</SUP>, HCNH<SUP>+</SUP>, or some other ionized heavy exospheric species) with representative masses 1, 14, and 28 amu. We also determine the ion flux into Titan's exobase for each species. The ambient ions are assumed to have a drifting Maxwellian distribution consistent with the Voyager observations, while the pickup ions are created with a radial distribution proportional to the neutral density profiles from the neutral exosphere model used in the 2-D MHD model of Cravens et al. (1998). The possibility that the ambient N<SUP>+</SUP> ions may have a shell distribution rather than a Maxwellian is also considered. The modeled ion distributions are compared with data from the Voyager 1 Plasma Science Instrument (PLS)., , The scaling exponent of a 1/f<SUP>α</SUP> noise time series is commonly estimated from the power-law slope of its Fourier power spectrum. Here I show that because 1/f<SUP>α</SUP> noises typically have significant power above the Nyquist frequency, measurements of their power spectra will often be severely distorted by aliasing, not only near the Nyquist frequency, but also far below it. I show that spectral aliasing typically leads to large systematic biases in the scaling exponents, and thus the fractal dimensions, that are estimated from the power-law slopes of 1/f<SUP>α</SUP> noise spectra. I describe a simple spectral filtering method that corrects the distortions introduced by spectral aliasing, and recovers the broadband spectrum of 1/f<SUP>α</SUP> noises. Like a Wiener filter, this filtering method does not require that the correct spectrum is known in advance. I illustrate this filtering technique using two environmental noise spectra that are distorted by aliasing., , We use the first 25% of the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey spectroscopic data to identify groups and clusters of galaxies in redshift space. The data set contains 8370 galaxies with confirmed redshifts in the range 0.7&lt;=z&lt;=1.4, over 1 deg<SUP>2</SUP> on the sky. Groups are identified using an algorithm (the Voronoi-Delaunay method) that has been shown to accurately reproduce the statistics of groups in simulated DEEP2-like samples. We optimize this algorithm for the DEEP2 survey by applying it to realistic mock galaxy catalogs and assessing the results using a stringent set of criteria for measuring group-finding success, which we develop and describe in detail here. We find in particular that the group finder can successfully identify ~78% of real groups and that ~79% of the galaxies that are true members of groups can be identified as such. Conversely, we estimate that ~55% of the groups we find can be definitively identified with real groups and that ~46% of the galaxies we place into groups are interloper field galaxies. Most importantly, we find that it is possible to measure the distribution of groups in redshift and velocity dispersion, n(σ,z), to an accuracy limited by cosmic variance, for dispersions greater than 350 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We anticipate that such measurements will allow strong constraints to be placed on the equation of state of the dark energy in the future. Finally, we present the first DEEP2 group catalog, which assigns 32% of the galaxies to 899 distinct groups with two or more members, 153 of which have velocity dispersions above 350 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We provide locations, redshifts and properties for this high-dispersion subsample. This catalog represents the largest sample to date of spectroscopically detected groups at z~1., To investigate coronal X-ray (≥ 6 keV) emission using RHESSI, we select long-duration (≥ 3 h) flares with completely or partially occulted footpoints. Flare footpoint sources dominate and thus obstruct the observation of coronal emission; short durations do not allow enough time for observation of various changes. We examine the location, morphology, size, height, and spectral characteristics in 20 long-duration flares seen with RHESSI whose footpoints are occulted by the solar limb to at most 30°. In 4 cases we see hard X-ray (≥ 20 keV) coronal sources; in the remaining cases hard X-ray emission comes from partially occulted footpoints only or the coronal emission is thermal., The Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) has detected nuclear gamma-ray line emission from at least eleven solar flares over the past three years. These gamma-ray lines are produced when flare-accelerated ions collide with the ambient solar medium. In this paper, we concentrate on the energy content and time profiles of accelerated ions and electrons. Ion spectral information is derived from suitable line ratios. We also compare the fluxes and timing of gamma-ray emission and high-energy electron bremsstrahlung emission. Finally, for the larger flares, we investigate the temporal variability of the nuclear de-excitation lines as well., The past eighteen months have produced the largest solar energetic particle events in the current solar cycle. We present a preliminary investigation of the effects of large solar storms on trapped electron populations in the magnetosphere using observations from the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) following the 28 October 2003, 27 July 2004, and 10 November 2004 storms. Although RHESSI's germanium detectors were designed to measure solar hard x-rays and gamma rays, they are large enough (7.1 cm diameter x 8.5 cm) to stop penetrating electrons and measure their energy up to 17 MeV, as well as detect bremsstrahlung radiation from the precipitating electrons. We first obtain raw counts spectra, which are a superposition of bremsstrahlung and direct electron detection signatures. We then apply a GEANT simulation model of the spacecraft and instrument in order to infer the original spectra of incoming electrons from the measured spectra. After the October 2003 storm, RHESSI detected electrons up to ~5 MeV that were transported into the slot region (below L=2.6), and subsequently began to diffuse away. In the month following the storm, the spectrum became softer as high-energy electrons receded from the L=1.0-2.6 region. By the end of November 2003, the highest-energy electrons detected dropped to ~2 MeV. At the beginning of June 2004, six months after the original storm, the relativistic electrons disappeared completely. A similar spectral analysis is done for the July 2004 and November 2004 storms., Non-fluidised, dry granular mass flows are obtained with rock fragments located on a rough rotating disk. In these flows that develop a quasi-rigid upper layer and a basal layer of colliding particles, dense clasts sink whereas light ones rise when surrounded by particles with intermediate density. Our experiments demonstrate that the presence of a quasi-rigid upper layer in granular mass flows does not prevent vertical segregation and that the formation of coarse-tail grading in pyroclastic flows does not require fluidising gases. High-speed videos reveal that vertical segregation in granular mass flow of rock fragments is generated by inertia differences between segregating clasts and matrix when they are both pushed upward by collisions with the basal layer. Coarse-tail grading occurs because the average segregation velocity of smaller clasts is smaller than that of larger clasts., The legacy of one of the greatest thinkers of the twentieth century., We investigate whether a small-scale turbulent dynamo can account quantitatively for the observed lower limit of X-ray surface flux in solar-type main sequence stars. Our approach is to use 3D numerical simulations of a turbulent dynamo driven by convection to characterize the dynamic behavior, magnetic field strengths, and filling factors in a non-rotating stratified medium, and to predict these magnetic properties at the surface of cool stars. We use simple applications of stellar structure theory for the convective envelopes of main-sequence stars to scale our simulations to the outer layers of stars in the F0--M0 spectral range, which allows us to estimate the unsigned magnetic flux on the surface of non-rotating reference stars. With these estimates we use the observed magnetic flux--X-ray flux correlation of Pevtsov et al. (2003) to predict the level of X-ray emission from such a turbulent dynamo, and find that our results compare well with observed lower limits of surface X-ray flux. This suggests that dynamo action from a convecting, non-rotating plasma is a viable alternative to acoustic heating models as an explanation for the basal emission level seen in chromospheric, transition region, and coronal diagnostics from late-type stars., This dissertation presents new observations and analysis methods that provide a fresh perspective on extragalactic giant molecular clouds (GMCs). Using observations of GMCs in several galaxies, this work studies molecular clouds in the context of their host galaxies, searching for variations in cloud populations and their star forming properties. The observations were conducted using the BIMA millimeter interferometer, obtaining high resolution imaging of molecular gas in the galaxies M33, M31 and M64. In the disks of galaxies in the Local Group, GMCs follow the same power-law relationships among their macroscopic properties: mass, radius and line width. However, there are significant differences in the mass distributions of these clouds, suggestive of systematic variations in the GMC formation mechanism in different galaxies. Where the ISM is predominantly atomic, GMCs are invariably found on filaments of HI, but such filaments do not necessarily imply the presence of GMCs. The angular momentum of GMCs in M33 is an order of magnitude lower than expected based on simple formation models from instabilities. The correlation with atomic gas and the low angular momentum suggest that the clouds form out of atomic gas with significant braking in the formation process. In M33 and M31, ~2/3 of the GMCs are correlated with Hα emission, implying a prompt onset of massive star formation. The correlation between GMCs and other objects with known ages or timescales implies that the lifetime of GMCs is 10-30 Myr. This work also presents high resolution observations of GMCs in the molecule rich galaxy M64. The highest mass GMCs in M64 (M<SUB>GMC</SUB>&gt;10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>sun</SUB>) are significantly smaller and denser than expected from extrapolations from lower mass clouds in the Local Group. Such high mass clouds may be responsible for the formation of massive star clusters in starburst systems and their high masses and densities may be necessary to form massive star clusters., I investigate the processes at work in the cancellation of normal magnetic flux in solar magnetograms, and study the relationships between cancellation and the budget of free energy in the coronal magnetic field that can power solar flares and CMEs. I begin by defining cancellation, and, focusing on reconnective cancellation, present the relevant equations describing the field evolution during cancellation. I then analyze these equations, to show that: 1) cancellation tends to reduce the magnetic energy of the hypothetical ""open"" field state; 2) in a sheared arcade field, steady cancellation adds free energy to the actual coronal field; and 3) horizontal magnetic flux can diffuse at a rate much lower than does the cancelling normal flux, even in the presence of constant resistivity. Finally, I briefly discuss the implications of boundary conditions in numerical simulations of flux cancellation., The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) uses a set of 9 rotating modulation collimators to image solar flares at x-ray and gamma-ray energies. RHESSI's imaging information is encoded in the rapid time modulation (~2 to ~500 Hz) of the detected flux. This poster discusses two new approaches to converting this modulated time profile into images. Currently telemetered time-tagged photon data are presented to imaging algorithms as counts in a series of very short time bins. For long integrations, this approach has the disadvantage that the number of time bins can become very large ((&gt;106)) and unwieldy. A new adaptation of folded epoch analysis is described that permits the ""stacking"" of data over multiple rotations. This can be done despite the distortion of the observed modulated time profile caused by variations in spacecraft pointing. For long integrations, stacking can dramatically compress the observational input to the imaging algorithms with little or no loss of imaging information. A second new development is the conversion of the stacked data into complex visibilities. Visibilities (which represent Fourier components of the source distribution) are determined from the amplitude and phase of short segments of the modulated x-ray waveform. They represent a compact, background-subtracted and fully-calibrated data product that is intermediate between the observed photon stream and images. Visibilities can be converted to images using reconstruction algorithms developed for radio interferometry. This poster also illustrates how RHESSI visibilities can be directly and quantitatively interpreted in terms of x-ray source size, shape and morphology., With various collaborators we have used the PFSS model to: 1) investigate topological changes in the coronal magnetic field related to active region strength, location and orientation within the background photospheric field; 2) investigate the relationship between large scale coronal magnetic field changes and the occurrence of CMEs; and 3) investigate the solar cycle variation of solar wind sources. Our experiences with the model, which is extremely versatile and easy to implement relative to magnetogram-based global force-free or MHD models, have been surprisingly positive considering the known physical shortcomings of the underlying assumptions. As long as one always keeps in mind the expected limitations of the potential field and spherical source surface assumptions, PFSS model makes it possible to approximate coronal open field regions as accurately as MHD models (or more so at the current state of MHD global modeling, depending on the latter's spatial resolution and resistivity properties), to describe coronal features observed in some CME event case studies, and to visualize the characteristics of a spherical geometry on null points and topological field domains related to a particular photospheric field distribution. Global potential model has often been used to be the initial state of a MHD model simulation. When viewed as a tool in the arsenal of solar physics, rather than as an end model, the PFSS approach opens the door to many applications that set the stage for later more sophisticated modeling. *work suppoted by DOD/solarMURI, the Center for Integrated Space Weather Modeling (an NSF Science and Technology Center), and NSF/ATM., In order to characterize the chemical composition of extraterrestrial materials (e.g. the organic content of the cometary and interstellar particles returned from the STARDUST mission), progress has been made in developing high spatial resolution vibrationally-selective microscopy techniques. To more readily quantify the relative contribution from aliphatic vs. aromatic hydrocarbons, multiple vibrations must be simultaneously excited to allow for direct comparison between peaks in the spectrum. To this end, we developed a multiplex coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscope, using chirped femtosecond laser pulses to achieve high spectral resolution images of model samples. As shown both experimentally and theoretically, the spectral resolution depend not only on the extent of the chirp, but on which pulses were chirped as well. When applied to microscopy, images of polystyrene beads show vibrational contrast arising from the C-H stretches, as seen in the point-specific spectra collected on and off the beads. By imaging selected spectral regions of the spectrum, chirped CARS microscopy shows promise for obtaining high spatial resolution, chemically specific images of the STARDUST samples., We report on the progress of 3D simulations of active region magnetic flux emergence (and decay) through the stratified, sub-photospheric layers of the upper convection zone into the solar atmosphere and low corona. We use a recently-developed 3D semi-implicit MHD code (with a non-uniform, adaptive mesh) to address the inherent stiffness of the system of equations, and will compare our results with similar studies using second-order accurate, fully explicit numerical schemes., The geomagnetic storm on January 21, 2005 was special and different from other storms that an unusual large amount of ions were precipitated into the upper atmosphere. The proton aurora imager SI-12 on the NASA IMAGE spacecraft observed the strongest proton aurora signal since the beginning of the mission in May 2000. The storm started at 17:12 when a large solar wind dynamic pressure pulse must have hit the magnetopause thereby creating a subauroral proton flash. Within 2 minutes the whole southern auroral oval increased in brightness and rapidly expanded into the previously empty polar cap. The cusp signature is consistent with a southward IMF at the beginning of the storm. After a perigee pass IMAGE-FUV observed the later stage of the storm after 23:00 with a strong cusp signal during northward IMF. At the same time the FAST satellite observed unusually large fluxes of precipitating ions in the cusp, while the NOAA satellites detected large fluxes of ion and electron precipitation on the dayside and unusual energies on the nightside. The presentation will describe the auroral morphology and compare the auroral brightness with the low altitude in-situ measurements of partiucle fluxes. We will also compare the temporal evolution with other geomagnetic storms during the IMAGE mission., The MINIS balloon campaign was successfully conducted in January 2005 to investigate relativistic electron loss mechanisms. Quantifying and understanding losses is an integral part of understanding the variability of relativistic electrons in the radiation belts. Balloon-based experiments directly measure precipitation and thus provide a method for quantifying losses, while the nearly stationary platform allows for the separation of temporal and spatial variations. A new class of precipitation event, characterized by extremely hard spectra, short durations, and complex temporal structure, occurring in the evening to midnight sector, was discovered by the INTERBOA balloon in 1996 and studied further by the MAXIS balloon in 2000. The MINIS campaign provided the first opportunities for multi-point measurements of electron precipitation up to MeV energies, including simultaneous measurements at different longitudes and at near-conjugate locations. Two balloons, each carrying an X-ray spectrometer for measuring the bremsstrahlung produced as electrons precipitate into the atmosphere, were launched from Churchill, Manitoba at 0850 UT on 21 January 2005 and 0140 UT on 25 January 2005. Four balloons, each carrying an X-ray spectrometer, a Z-axis search coil magnetometer, and a 3-axis electric field instrument providing DC electric field and VLF measurements in 3 frequency bands, were launched from the South African Antarctic Station (SANAE IV). The Southern launches took place at 1400 UT on 17 January, 1309 UT on 19 January, 2115 UT on 20 January, and 0950 UT on 24 January 24 2005. In this paper, we present the preliminary results from the MINIS North and South X-ray data. The first and second Southern payloads observed a rarely-seen phenomenon: gamma-ray line emission from nuclear interactions of solar protons in the Earth's atmosphere. When the solar particles abated, there were numerous opportunities for simultaneous observations of MeV precipitation from multiple payloads; we will present the first analysis of these data., Over the last decade, several crucial shortcomings of the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model have been recognized on galaxy-size scales. In this thesis I present new observations addressing two of these problems: the substructure problem and the central density problem. I describe results from our search for a connection between high-velocity clouds (HVCs) and the low-mass dark matter halos seen in CDM simulations that appear to be missing from the real universe. This survey demonstrates that HVCs do not have stellar counterparts similar to other Local Group dwarf galaxies; if HVCs contain any stars at all, their surface brightnesses must be substantially lower than those of any known dwarfs. I also discuss observations of two candidate dark galaxies in the Local Group: Complex H and HVC 127-41-330. Complex H is a massive, nearby HVC containing ∼2 × 10<SUP>7</SUP> Msun of HI and less than ∼3 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> Msun of stars, leaving it with an HI mass to light ratio several times higher than any known galaxy. HVC 127-41-330 is a smaller HVC that appears to be interacting with the dwarf galaxy LGS 3, placing it at a distance of 700 kpc. The HVC is rotating, with a dynamical mass that makes it dark matter-dominated for any plausible distance. The existence of these two starless objects suggests that the substructure problem is related to the difficulty of forming stars in low-mass dark matter halos. However, many more dark galaxies must be located in order to resolve the substructure problem. <P />In addition, I present a rotation curve analysis of five nearby dwarf galaxies, based on high-resolution two-dimensional velocity fields in Halpha and CO. In contrast to previous studies, most of the galaxies in this sample do not seem to have a strong preference for pseudo-isothermal density profiles. Instead, these objects exhibit the full range of dark matter density profiles between constant density and NFW halos. One galaxy, NGC 2976, definitively contains a large constant-density core that presents a significant challenge for CDM models. However, for another galaxy, NGC 5963, the derived density profile has a very steep central slope and is well fit by an NFW profile, confirming that some galaxies do contain cuspy profiles like the ones predicted by CDM. This observing program was designed to overcome some of the limitations of the traditional techniques of long-slit Halpha spectroscopy and low-resolution HI observations. The results demonstrate that there is a distribution of central density slopes rather than the single universal density profile seen in CDM simulations. Four out of the five observed galaxies show evidence for noncircular motions, which are attributed to the triaxiality of their dark matter halos. These motions constrain the ellipticities of the halos in the planes of the disks to be larger than a few percent., The THEMIS Education and Public Outreach team selected ten ground-based magnetometer stations each located in the proximity of a rural school in traditionally under-served, under-represented communities from Alaska to Vermont. These `ground based magnetometer' observatories will assist the THEMIS Mission's five identical satellites, called probes, when they are launched in the fall of 2006. The five probes, placed in strategic locations in Earth's magnetosphere, will help to determine the onset of auroral substorms. A teacher at each of these schools is responsible for their magnetometer data and system as well as using the data with their students through lesson plans developed collaboratively with the E/PO team. The network of teachers, students, and magnetometers together with other students who participate in monitoring the geomagnetic disturbances using the web is called the Geomagnetic Event Observation Network by Students (GEONS). We will report specific contributions to the project from the Oregon, South Dakota and Michigan GEONS teachers. We have installed five magnetometers during the Fall of 2004, and will be installing the remaining five in the Spring of 2005, and have started to display the data from the first five schools on the web. We will describe the pedagogical challenges of bringing understanding of the physics behind the THEMIS science which requires some understanding of magnetic fields, charged particles, forces, motions, and energy to middle school and high school classrooms. We will also include the formative evaluation results to date., The proton aurora imager SI-12 on the IMAGE spacecraft occasionally observes subauroral proton precipitation in the morning and the afternoon sectors. Sub-auroral Morning Proton Spots (SAMPS) rotate with 80-90% of the Earth's corotation speed, while the detached afternoon proton arcs do not move in local time. Coincident particle measurements by DMSP of both phenomena confirm the source as pure high energy precipitating protons with energy likely above the detector limit of 30 keV. The spots appear after magnetic storms in the recovery phase and last for 1-4 hours in the magnetic local time region of 0600-1200 hours. The subauroral arcs appear after a direction change of the southward or westward components of the interplanetary magnetic field. IMAGE-EUV observations of the plasmasphere indicate a relationship with density gradients in the plasmapause. This is supported by nearby geosynchronous observations of increased cold plasma density. We interpret these phenomena as the result of the interaction of ring current protons with electromagnetic ion-cyclotron (EMIC) waves caused by the dense, cold plasmasphere ions. The spots are therefore a consequence of plasmasphere refilling after geomagnetic storms. In contrast, the afternoon arcs are the result of enhanced EMIC waves during moderately disturbed geomagnetic conditions., Solar flare plasmas contain thermal and non-thermal electron populations, both of which emit characteristic X-ray bremsstrahlung spectra. The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) observes X-rays above 3~keV with a spectral resolution of ~1~keV FWHM. RHESSI spectra typically show a thermal continuum dominant below ~10~keV and a non-thermal continuum dominant above ~30~keV. Distinguishing between the two electron populations is crucial in determining the total energy contained in non-thermal electrons. High-temperature plasmas also emit characteristic line spectra, including emission in the Fe and Fe/Ni ""line complexes"" at ~6.7 and ~8~keV. Recent predictions and subsequent empirical confirmation have shown that the fluxes and equivalent widths of these complexes are strongly temperature-dependent (Phillips 2004, Caspi et al. 2004). We use the Fe and Fe/Ni line complexes to obtain constraints on the thermal electrons for a variety of large (GOES class M and X) solar flares, with emphasis on the X4.8 event on 23 July 2002, to determine the time-varying characteristics of the thermal and non-thermal electron populations. We estimate and compare the energy contained in these electrons, and discuss the implications for acceleration and heating of electrons in solar flares., We used three-dimensional MHD simulation to study the evolution of U-shaped magnetic field lines (U-loops) in a flux cancellation region on the Sun. Emergence of U-loops is thought to be a process for causing flux cancellation at the solar surface, although the physical mechanism for this process is not obvious because the mass tends to accumulate at the dipped part of U-loops thereby reducing the buoyancy. Our flux emergence simulation reveals that a temporary siphon flow plays a key role in enhancing the buoyancy of the dipped part of U-loops and helps it emerge into the solar atmosphere against the gravity. By applying a model of emerging U-loops to an observed flux cancellation region, we study a possible configuration of magnetic field lines related to flux cancellation., In the near Earth plasma sheet, the three dimensional plasma and energetic particle investigation (3DP) on the Wind spacecraft has detected very rapid (&lt; 1 second) changes in the electron distributions. The changes generally consist of a transition from a relatively high density, low temperature distribution to a low density, higher temperature distribution. These changes coincide with intervals of large magnetic field fluctuations, large ion velocity moments, and increases in the flux of energetic particles. The goal of this work is to determine whether the electrons are accelerated in situ or if two distinct electron populations are being sampled as the boundary between them is swept by the spacecraft. First results indicate that the change in the electron distributions is nonadiabatic in both the thermodynamic sense, i.e., the specific entropy is not constant, and in the kinetic sense: the first adiabatic invariant is not conserved. Since changes in the magnetic field coccur on timescales much longer than the electron gyroperiod, one would expect that for a local acceleration process the first adiabatic invariant would be conserved in the absence of invariant breaking processes such as wave-particle interactions. Although we cannot rule out nonadiabatic in situ acceleration, the simplest interpretation is that the electrons are accelerated elsewhere and transported to the observation point with the boundary between the ambient and accelerated electrons passing over the spacecraft in less than one second., Radio frequency interference (RFI) is a significant problem for current and future radio telescopes. We describe here a method for postcorrelation cancellation of RFI for the special case of an extended source observed with an interferometer that spatially resolves the astronomical signal. In this circumstance the astronomical signal is detected through the autocorrelations of each antenna but is not present in the cross correlations between antennas. We assume that the RFI is detected in both autocorrelations and cross correlations, which is true for many cases. The large number of cross correlations can provide a very high interference-to-noise ratio reference signal which can be adaptively subtracted from the autocorrelation signals. The residual signal is free of interference to significant levels. We discuss the application of this technique for detection of the spin-flip transition of interstellar deuterium with the Allen Telescope Array. The technique may also be of use for epoch of reionization experiments and with multibeam feeds on single-dish telescopes., Decades of global-scale terrestrial imaging from space at far-ultraviolet wavelengths have provided many examples of solar- and geomagnetic storm-driven disturbances of the ionosphere/thermosphere system. However, in most cases the monitoring of ionospheric and thermospheric emissions has been a secondary mission goal, with auroral imaging taking precedence. Only recently have routine measurements of the state of the ionosphere and thermosphere through remote FUV imaging become a top science focus of missions such as TIMED. Measurements like these, along with years of dayside and nightside measurements of the FUV emissions of atomic oxygen by IMAGE/FUV have provided the best global picture of solar flare, substorm, and magnetic storm effects on the I-T system to date. The great utility of a high-altitude global imager is to provide continuous measurements for comparisons with data from satellites in low-earth orbit making periodic in-situ measurements. This was demonstrated during the Dynamics Explorer mission of the 1980s, and more recently in coordinated studies of space weather effects in the ionosphere and thermosphere, using data from the ROCSAT 1 and CHAMP satellite missions, respectively. Examples from these and other recent studies relevant to multiple sub-disciplines of I-T science will be discussed. These examples demonstrate the relevance and value of the LWS FUV imager to the proposed LWS I-T Storm Probes mission., A large portion of theoretical work on describing the large scale plasma evolution in solar and laboratory plasmas relies on Taylor's theory of relaxation which predicts that a plasma configuration will relax to a constant α profile, i.e., a force-free state with a constant in space coefficient of proportionality between the magnetic field and current density J = α B. Observations, however, show that α in the active region is a complex function of space (e.g. Zhang et al., 2001). In particular, the spatial profile of α consists of adjacent patches of opposite sign. We present a numerical MHD model of the dynamics of the active region plasma under photospheric boundary flows which addresses questions associated with the spatial structure of α. The simulations reveal that the evolution proceeds through a formation of adjacent, nearly force-free regions with parallel and anti-parallel magnetic fields and current densities, i.e. with α of opposite signs. We present the details of the model, explain the structure of the obtained solutions and the reason for the formation of such configurations. The boundary conditions are modeled by imposing a velocity profile and deriving consistent conditions on the magnetic field from the MHD equations. In order to address the numerical difficulties associated with the stiffness of the resistive MHD equations we use new exponential propagation iterative (EPI) methods which allow accurate time integration with time steps exceeding the CFL restriction on explicit schemes., Observations of hard X-ray/gamma-ray continuum and gamma-ray lines produced by energetic electrons and ions, respectively, colliding with the solar atmosphere, have shown that large solar flares can accelerate ions up to many GeV and electrons up to hundreds of MeV. Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are observed by spacecraft near 1 AU and by ground-based instrumentation to extend up to similar energies in large SEP events, but it is believed that a different acceleration process associated with fast Coronal mass Ejections (CMEs) is responsible. The Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) mission provides high-resolution spectroscopy and imaging of flare hard X-rays and gamma-rays. Such observations can provide information on the location, energy spectra, and composition of the flare accelerated energetic particles at the Sun. We compare the RHESSI observations of the 2003 October 28, 2003 November 2, and 2005 January 20 flares with both energetic electron and ion observations near 1 AU from ACE, SAMPEX, Wind,and GOES spacecraft, and discuss the implications for the particle acceleration and escape processes, RHESSI is uniquely suited to observe solar microflares due to its unique sensitivity in the 3-15 keV energy range (up to ~100 times better than previous solar instruments). As such, it provides new information on these low level transients. Initial results (Krucker et al 2002, Benz &amp; Grigis 2002) suggest that microflares are different from larger flares. They are more often associated with steep nonthermal spectra (power law index -5 to -7). In this study, we present microflare statistics from times of low activity. A list of microflares was created by applying the standard RHESSI flare-finding algorithm to the lower 6-12 keV energy range (~10,000 events). Imaging was used in order to obtain positions of solar events and reject non-solar events. These solar events were then each spectrally analyzed. We present microflare statistics, including active region productivity, and the microflare frequency distribution. This work was supported by NASA contract NAS5-98033., Different magnetic field configurations are proposed or required for CME initiations by different models. In particular, ""breakout"" model (Antiochos, 1998; Antiochos et al., 1999) requires a mutiflux system that allows closed flux transfer between different systems and energy release during the euption of an underlying sheared structure. On the other hand, Linker et al. (2003) showed with MHD simulations that adequate amount of flux cancellation at the neutral line at the base of a single arcade structure may also lead to an eruption of a sheared structure. Debates are on going between different CME initiation models. We found, using observational data and PFSS model extrapolations, that both multiflux system and single arcade configuration exist at CME source regions. We present these cases and our analyses of the magnetic field topology and other characteristics of the events. *work suppoted by NSF/ATM, DOD/solarMURI, and the Center for Integrated Space Weather Modeling (an NSF Science and Technology Center)., The Cassini Orbiter CAPS and INMS detections of an ionosphere of Saturn's rings during SOI, coupled with the internal dipole field offset detected on previous missions, motivated the present numerical analysis of mass 32 and 16 singly charged ions in Saturn's inner magnetosphere. The combination of the source of heavy pickup ions in the plane of the rotational equator, at radial distances of ~1.4-2.4 Saturn radii, and the dipole offset combine to produce a heavy ion torus with suggested consequences yet to be observationally confirmed. Although the neutral atmosphere is expected to be roughly symmetric about the ring plane (Johnson et al. 2005), the modeled ion spatial distribution exhibits major North-South asymmetries due to asymmetric photo-ionization and the dipole offset, and also due to the fact that the ring ion source spans the radial distance where the Keplerian velocity is equal to the ion corotation velocity, Rc. We find that for R&lt;Rc there is an implied zone of ring ion precipitation into Saturn's southern midlatitude hemisphere and, at the outer edge, the ring atmosphere can contribute heavy ion species to the inner magnetosphere. While the Cassini Orbiter is not destined to provide any further in-situ sampling of the ring ionosphere during its prime mission, its remote sensing capabilities in the UV and in energetic neutral atoms may yield some evidence for (or against) the presented modeling results., Above some critical Mach number, quasiperpendicular collisionless shocks are known to exhibit ``overshoot'' and ``undershoot'' structure thought to be associated with the motion of ions trapped at the shock front. Using spacecraft potential data from the Cluster spacecraft, the overshoot/undershoot density structure at 56 crossings of the quasiperpendicular bow shock is studied. The envelope of the absolute value of the density, in most cases, decays exponentially and these envelopes are fitted to a decaying function from which we calculate the decay length scale. The overshoot/undershoot wavelength is also estimated using the zero crossings of the density profile and a good correlation between the average wavelength and the convected ion gyroradius is found: the wavelength is approximately two to three times the ion gyroradius. There is no evidence of a strong correlation between the wavelength and the ion inertial length. Similar results are found for the decay length, which also seems to be ordered by the convected ion gyroradius., We have searched the first-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) W-band CMB anisotropy map for evidence of cosmic strings. We set a limit on the dimensionless string parameter δ of δ=8πGμγβ&lt;2.9×10<SUP>-5</SUP> for the statistical search for a significant number of strings in the map. We also set a limit using the uniform-distribution-of-strings model in the WMAP data with δ=8πGμγβ&lt;7.3×10<SUP>-5</SUP> at the 95% confidence level (CL). The pattern search technique we developed in this paper set a limit δ=8πGμγβ&lt;1.5×10<SUP>-5</SUP> at the 95% CL, which corresponds to a limit on the symmetry-breaking energy scale of &lt;~10<SUP>16</SUP>GeV/&lt;γβ&gt;., We have performed a series of laboratory experiments to simulate the X-ray spectrum of comet C/1999 T1 (McNaught-Hartley) observed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Our experiments utilize the University of California Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory EBIT-I electron beam ion trap, in which the relevant ions are generated and made to collide with the appropriate neutral gases in order to produce X-ray emission by charge exchange. The X-ray emission is recorded with a high-resolution microcalorimeter detector built at the Goddard Space Flight Center. In addition to the K-shell X-ray emission of highly charged ions of C, N, and O, we have also recorded the emission of heliumlike Ne. Unlike in an earlier fit of comet C/1999 S4 (LINEAR), neon emission was found to be necessary to simulate the McNaught-Hartley data. Excellent agreement between the laboratory simulation and the McNaught-Hartley spectrum is obtained. The ion fractions inferred from the simulation agree very well with direct solar wind measurements. This work was performed under the auspices of the Department of Energy by UC-LLNL under contract W-7405-ENG-48 and supported by NASA's Planetary Atmospheres Program under Work Order W-19,938., We survey Lunar Prospector Electron Reflectometer measurements from times when the Moon was located in the geomagnetic tail, in order to characterize the occurrence of large (&gt;500 V) negative lunar surface potentials, as identified by upward-going electron beams. We find that charging to these levels is rare, but that such charging events do occasionally occur in both sunlight and shadow. Large surface potentials are found primarily in the plasma sheet, and their occurrence depends mainly on the incident electron spectrum rather than surface properties. Most examples occur in shadow, where the current from energetic electrons dominates. However, some occur in sunlight, suggesting the occasional presence of either lower photoemission than expected or non-monotonic potentials. Depending on the electric field scale height, significant electric fields of up to ~100 V/m may sometimes exist at the lunar surface., The status of CP violation and the CKM matrix is reviewed. Direct CP violation in B decay has been established and the measurement of sin 2β in ψK modes reached 5% accuracy. I discuss the implications of these, and of the possible deviations of the CP asymmetries in b → s modes from that in ψK. The first meaningful measurements of α and γ are explained, together with their significance for constraining both the SM and new physics in B - bar {B} mixing. I also discuss implications of recent developments in the theory of nonleptonic decays for B → πK rates and CP asymmetries, and for the polarization in charmless B decays to two vector mesons. <P />LBNL-55944, In this study, we demonstrate that mid-latitude surface measurements of diurnal temperature range (DTR) can be used to reconstruct decadal variability of regional-scale terrestrial photosynthetic activity 1) during and prior to the period with satellite retrievals of land greenness and 2) without the need for moisture data. While the two relative maxima present in the seasonal evolution of DTR can determine the beginning and the end of the growing season, the summertime average DTR can be used as a proxy of summertime terrestrial photosynthesis. In a case study in the eastern United States (1966-1997), the DTR reconstructions indicate significant natural decadal variability in photosynthetic activity, but no secular, long-term trend. The summertime photosynthesis was found to be controlled primarily by moisture availability. Also, contrary to existing model parameterizations, the timing of spring onset was found to depend on both temperature and moisture., A diamond-impregnated bit will be the most probable choice for Mars drilling applications. This is because it can be used to drill or cut the hardest rocks, including the most common rocks on Mars, i.e., basalt and andesite (Bandfield et al., 2000). Recent results suggest a possibility of the Martian regolith containing clay minerals (Webster and Savage, 2004; Ruff, 2003), products of chemical weathering of certain minerals such as, for example, olivine (Hoefen et al., 2003) in the presence of water. Thus, in addition to volcanic rocks, the bit might also have to drill through other geological formations, including, for example, clay-rich soils commonly known as mud. This argument supposes that the Martian drill will have no option for changing bits. Thus the question exists, whether a bit of the diamond-impregnated type can also be used successfully in frozen mud. It was found that mud exhibits three different physical conditions, depending on its temperature. The bit can effectively drill and the entire core can be successfully recovered provided that the mud is kept in the temperature region between approximately -8°C and 0°C. Above 0°C the mud becomes sticky. Below -8°C the mud is hard frozen and the bit cannot penetrate it successfully. Measurement of the electrical resistance of the mud directly below the bit while drilling was used together with the bit temperature to assess the physical state of the mud below the bit., Doppler spectroscopy has detected 152 planets around nearby stars. A major puzzle is why many of their orbits are highly eccentric; all planets in our Solar System are on nearly circular orbits, as is expected if they formed by accretion processes in a protostellar disk. Several mechanisms have been proposed to generate large eccentricities after planet formation, but so far there has been little observational evidence to support any particular model. Here we report that the current orbital configuration of the three giant planets around upsilon Andromedae (υ And) probably results from a close dynamical interaction with another planet, now lost from the system. The planets started on nearly circular orbits, but chaotic evolution caused the outer planet (υ And d) to be perturbed suddenly into a higher-eccentricity orbit. The coupled evolution of the system then causes slow periodic variations in the eccentricity of the middle planet (υ And c). Indeed, we show that υ And c periodically returns to a very nearly circular state every 6,700 years., The hard X-ray emission from the “giant” solar flare on 4 November 2003 ( 1947 UT) was observed by the hard X-ray/gamma ray spectrometer on the Ulysses spacecraft located at 114 degrees west of the Sun-Earth line at a distance of 5.28 AU from the Sun. A “small” hard X-ray burst during the early rise of the giant flare and a part of the decay of the hard X-ray emission associated with the giant flare were also observed by the hard X-ray imager on the RHESSI satellite located near the Earth. The maximum of the hard X-ray emission during the giant flare could not be observed by the RHESSI instrument because of satellite night. The flare view angles for Ulysses and RHESSI were 31° West and 83° East respectively. The H-α flare (importance 3B) was located at S19 W83 in the active region NOAA 10486. GOES observations of the associated soft X-ray emission saturated during the period 1943-1958 UT. It has been estimated that the soft X-ray maximum occurred at 1947 UT with peak flux equivalent to NOAA class gid X28. OVSA radio observations show that the flare produced intense microwave emission, the peak flux at 15.4 GHz being 60 000 sfu at 1945 UT. Intense type II, III and IV radio bursts have also been reported at metric and decimetric wavelengths. RHESSI has provided 10-100 keV X-ray images and spectra for 1930-1936 UT (the early rise of the flare) and 10-30 keV images and spectra for 2016-2114 UT (a part of the late decay of the flare). Ulysses observed an increase in 25-150 keV X-rays from 1933 UT to 2015 UT with the maximum at 1944 UT, almost simultaneously with the maximum in 15.4 GHz radio emission and 3 min before the maximum in the soft X-ray emission. This indicates that the X-ray emission observed by Ulysses was mostly non-thermal. An assumed hard X-ray spectrum of E<SUP>-3.5</SUP> photons cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> keV<SUP>-1</SUP> for &gt;20 keV photons leads to an energy dissipation rate of ∼ 6.4 × 10<SUP>31</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> at the time of the hard X-ray maximum. The total energy in &gt;20 keV electrons released during the flare is estimated to be 1.3 × 10<SUP>34</SUP> erg., Future missions to Mars envision use of drills for subsurface exploration. Since the Martian atmosphere precludes the use of liquids for cuttings removal, proposed drilling machines utilize mechanical cuttings removal systems such as augers. However, an auger can substantially contribute to the total power requirements, and in the worst scenario it can choke. A number of experiments conducted under Martian pressures showed that intermittent blasts of gas at low differential pressures can effectively lift the cuttings out of the hole. A gas flushing system could be incorporated into the drill assembly for assistance in clearing the holes of rock cuttings or for redundancy in case of auger jamming. A number of variables such as the particle size distribution of the rock powder, the type of gas used, the bit and auger side clearances, the initial mass of cuttings, and the ambient pressure were investigated and found to affect the efficiency. In all tests the initial volume of gas was close to 1 L and the differential pressure was varied to achieve desired clearing efficiencies. Particles were being lifted out of the hole at a maximum speed of 6 m/s at a differential pressure of 25 torr and ambient pressure of 5 torr. Flushing tests lasted on average for 2 s. The power required to compress the thin Martian atmosphere to achieve a sufficient gas blast every minute or so at 10% efficiency was calculated to be of the order of a few watts., Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons on galaxy cluster electrons produces a linear polarization, which contains some information on the local quadrupole at the cluster location. We use N-body simulations to create, for the first time, maps of this polarization signal. We then look at the different properties of the polarization with respect to the cluster position and redshift., We investigate the properties of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in the molecule-rich galaxy M64 (NGC 4826). In M64, the mean surface density of molecular gas is 2N(H<SUB>2</SUB>)~10<SUP>22</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> over a 2 kpc region, equal to the surface densities of individual GMCs in the Milky Way. We observed the J=1--&gt;0 transitions of CO, <SUP>13</SUP>CO, and HCN. The line ratio W<SUB>CO</SUB>/W<SUB>13CO</SUB> for 200pc&lt;R<SUB>gal</SUB>&lt;800pc is comparable to that found in the Milky Way and increases significantly outside this region, in part because of a large contribution to the CO emission from diffuse gas, which composes 25% of the molecular mass in the galaxy. We developed a modified CLUMPFIND algorithm to decompose the <SUP>13</SUP>CO emission into 25 resolved clouds. The clouds have a luminosity-line width relationship L~ΔV<SUP>2.2+/-0.4</SUP>, substantially different from the Milky Way trend, L~ΔV<SUP>5</SUP>. Similarly, the clouds have a line width-size relationship of ΔV~R<SUP>1.0+/-0.3</SUP><SUB>e</SUB>, compared to ΔV~R<SUP>0.5</SUP><SUB>e</SUB> in the Milky Way. Estimates of the kinetic and binding energies of the clouds suggest that the clouds are self-gravitating and significantly overpressured with respect to the remainder of the ISM in M64. The <SUP>13</SUP>CO-to-H<SUB>2</SUB> conversion factor is comparable to what is seen in the Galaxy. The M64 clouds have a mean surface density at least 2.5 times larger than observed in Local Group GMCs, and the surface density is not independent of mass as it is in the Local Group: Σ<SUB>H2</SUB>~M<SUP>0.7+/-0.2</SUP>. The clouds are correlated with the recombination emission from the galaxy, implying that they are star forming; the rate is comparable to that in other galaxies despite the increased densities of the clouds. The gas-to-dust ratio is similar to the Galactic value, but the low extinction in the visual band requires that the molecular gas be clumpy on small scales. We note that the internal pressures of clouds in several galaxies scale with the external pressure exerted on the clouds by the ambient ISM: P<SUB>int</SUB>~P<SUP>0.75+/-0.05</SUP><SUB>ext</SUB>. We attribute the differences between M64 molecular clouds and those in the Local Group to the high ambient pressures and large molecular gas content found in M64., The Cosmic Hot Interstellar Plasma Spectrometer (CHIPS) was designed to study diffuse emission from hot gas in the local interstellar cavity in the wavelength range 90-265 Å. Between launch in 2003 January and early 2004, the instrument was operated in narrow-slit mode, achieving a peak spectral resolution of about 1.4 Å FWHM. Observations were carried out preferentially at high Galactic latitudes; weighted by observing time, the mean absolute value of the Galactic latitude for all narrow-slit observations combined is about 45°. The total integration time is about 13.2 Ms (74% day, 26% night). In the context of a standard collisional ionization equilibrium plasma model, the CHIPS data set tight constraints on the emission measure at temperatures between 10<SUP>5.55</SUP> and 10<SUP>6.4</SUP> K. At 10<SUP>6.0</SUP> K, the 95% upper limit on the emission measure is about 0.0004 cm<SUP>-6</SUP> pc for solar-abundance plasma with a foreground neutral hydrogen column of 2×10<SUP>18</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. This constraint, derived primarily from limits on the extreme ultraviolet emission lines of highly ionized iron, is well below the range for the local hot bubble estimated previously from soft X-ray studies. If the pattern of elemental depletion in the hot gas follows that observed in much denser interstellar clouds, the gas-phase abundance of iron, relative to other heavy elements that contribute more to the soft X-ray emission, might be much lower than solar. However, to support the emission measures inferred previously from X-ray data would require depletions much higher than the moderate values reported previously for hot gas. Excluding the He II Lyman lines, which are known to be primarily terrestrial in origin, the brightest feature we find in the integrated spectrum is an Fe IX line at 171.1 Å. The sky-averaged flux of the feature is about 6 photons cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> sr<SUP>-1</SUP>, a flux that exceeds the 1 σ shot noise significantly but is comparable to the systematic uncertainty. We find bright 171.1 Å emission (flux greater than 10 photons cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> sr<SUP>-1</SUP> and S/N &gt;2) in about 10% of the observing time. However, these bright observations overwhelmingly select for daytime (96% of 1.3 Ms). Thus, a local rather than interstellar origin for much of the 171.1 Å emission seems likely., The October 22-24, 2003 interplanetary magnetic cloud was characterized by an exceptionally long interval (~32 hours) of nearly purely northward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). Following the northward IMF turning Cluster observed a gradual transition to a cold (&lt;1 keV) and dense (~1-2 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) plasma sheet (CDPS). Cluster observed CDPS continuously for the following ~30 hours while passing through the neutral sheet from the northern to the southern hemisphere. DMSP observations mapped to the equatorial plasma sheet reveal that the CDPS extended to all nightside local times. The FAST satellite observed reversed ion dispersion signatures in the cusp indicative of poleward-of-cusp reconnection, and nearly no polar cap. The CDPS observations show good agreement with a global MHD simulation where the CDPS is formed by poleward-of-cusp reconnection capturing magnetosheath plasma and convecting it to the tail. The process shrinks the size of the lobes (and therefore the polar cap) significantly, as observed., Although the highest redshift QSOs (z&gt;6.1) are embedded in a significantly neutral background universe (mass-averaged neutral hydrogen fraction &gt;1%) as suggested by the Gunn-Peterson absorption troughs in their spectra, the intergalactic medium in their vicinity is highly ionized. The highly ionized region is generally idealized as spherical and called the Strömgren sphere. In this paper, by combining the expected evolution of the Strömgren sphere with the rule that the speed of light is finite, we illustrate the apparent shape of the ionization fronts around the highest redshift QSOs and its evolution, which depends on the age, luminosity evolution, and environment of the QSO (e.g., the hydrogen reionization history). The apparent shape may systematically deviate from a spherical shape, unless the QSO age is significantly long compared to the hydrogen recombination process within the ionization front and the QSO luminosity evolution is significantly slow. Effects of anisotropy of QSO emission are also discussed. The apparent shape of the Strömgren sphere may be directly mapped by transmitted spectra of background sources behind or inside the ionized regions or by surveys of the hyperfine transition (21cm) line emission of neutral hydrogen., We report that a sharp lateral boundary exists at the southern edge of the Pacific superplume. The set of SHdiff waveforms, which graze the South Pacific, have similar features to those observed previously at the southeastern edge of the African superplume. Both waveform sets show a rapid shift of the arrival time and the broadening of the waveforms with respect to the azimuth as previously reported in the case of the African plume. We also document here that they both show a secondary pulse that follows the direct Sdiff phase. The coupled mode/spectral element method, which can handle strong lateral variations of shear velocity in Dʺ, is used to construct synthetic waveforms. The postcursors can be explained by simple effects of 3D structure in the Dʺ region with a sharp quasi vertical boundary aligned almost parallel to the ray path. The existence of these pulses suggests that modeling of heterogeneity outside of the great circle path can help constrain the 3D structure at the base of the mantle. When including 3D effects in the modeling, we find that the velocity contrast across the sharp boundary is of the order of 4-5%, averaged over the last 300 km of the mantle, which is smaller than has been proposed in some studies, but larger than in existing tomographic models, implying that the ""superplume"" features at the base of the mantle cannot be purely thermal. The similarity of the two observed SHdiff waveform sets at relatively high frequencies indicates that the low velocity regions in the lower mantle under Pacific and Africa, corresponding to the strong degree-2 pattern in shear velocity tomographic models, have a similar nature also at finer scales., Models with low-scale breaking of global symmetries in the neutrino sector provide an alternative to the seesaw mechanism for understanding why neutrinos are light. Such models can easily incorporate light sterile neutrinos required by the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector experiment. Furthermore, the constraints on the sterile neutrino properties from nucleosynthesis and large-scale structure can be removed due to the nonconventional cosmological evolution of neutrino masses and densities. We present explicit, fully realistic supersymmetric models, and discuss the characteristic signatures predicted in the angular distributions of the cosmic microwave background., We present Adaptive Optics observations of Neptune's ring system at 1.6 and 2.2 μm, taken with the 10-m W.M. Keck II telescope in July 2002 and October 2003. We recovered the full Adams and Le Verrier rings for the first time since the Voyager era (1989), and show that the overall appearance of these rings did not change much, except for the ring arcs. Both the location and intensity of all arcs changed drastically relative to trailing arc Fraternité, which has a mean orbital motion of 820.1118 ± 0.0001 deg/day, equal to that of Nicholson et al.'s (1995, Icarus 113, 295-330) solution 2. Our data suggest that all arcs may have decayed over the last decade, while Liberté, in 2003, may be on the verge of disappearing completely. The observed changes in the relative intensities and locations of all arcs further indicate that material is migrating between resonance sites; leading arc Courage, for example, has jumped ∼8°, or, when adopting Namouni and Porco's (2002, Nature 417, 45-47) CER (corotation eccentricity resonance) theory, it advanced by one full corotation potential maximum. Overall, our observations reveal a system that is surprisingly dynamic, and no comprehensive theory exists as of yet that can explain all the observed intricacies., We derive rotation curves for four nearby, low-mass spiral galaxies and use them to constrain the shapes of their dark matter density profiles. This analysis is based on high-resolution two-dimensional Hα velocity fields of NGC 4605, NGC 5949, NGC 5963, and NGC 6689 and CO velocity fields of NGC 4605 and NGC 5963. In combination with our previous study of NGC 2976, the full sample of five galaxies contains density profiles that span the range from α<SUB>DM</SUB>=0 to α<SUB>DM</SUB>=1.20, where α<SUB>DM</SUB> is the power-law index describing the central density profile. The scatter in α<SUB>DM</SUB> from galaxy to galaxy is 0.44, 3 times as large as in cold dark matter (CDM) simulations, and the mean density profile slope is α<SUB>DM</SUB>=0.73, shallower than that predicted by the simulations. These results call into question the hypothesis that all galaxies share a universal dark matter density profile. We show that one of the galaxies in our sample, NGC 5963, has a cuspy density profile that closely resembles those seen in CDM simulations, demonstrating that while galaxies with the steep central density cusps predicted by CDM do exist, they are in the minority. In spite of these differences between observations and simulations, the relatively cuspy density profiles we find do not suggest that this problem represents a crisis for CDM. Improving the resolution of the simulations and incorporating additional physics may resolve the remaining discrepancies. We also find that four of the galaxies contain detectable radial motions in the plane of the galaxy. We investigate the hypothesis that these motions are caused by a triaxial dark matter halo and place lower limits on the ellipticity of the orbits in the plane of the disk of 0.043-0.175. <P />Based on observations carried out at the WIYN Observatory. The WIYN Observatory is a joint facility of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Indiana University, Yale University, and the National Optical Astronomy Observatory., In the third paragraph of <A href=""/abs/2004AJ.128.1273W"">AJ, 128, 1273 (2004)</A>, the reported form of the polynomial expression for M<SUB>V</SUB> for the main sequence, M<SUB>V,MS</SUB>(B-V), is not that used in the rest of the paper. The fit used is actually a ninth-order polynomial in B-V with coefficients {1.11255, 5.79062, -16.76829, 76.47777, -140.08488, 127.38044, -49.71805, -8.24265, 14.07945, -3.43155}. This fit differs by no more than 0.2 mag from the published fit when 0&lt;B-V&lt;1.5. <P />Also, the ΔM<SUB>V</SUB> values reported at the end of <A href=""/abs/2004AJ.128.1273W"">AJ, 128, 1273 (2004)</A> are slightly inaccurate. The correct ΔM<SUB>V</SUB> values for HD 9562, 167215, 45067, 89744, and 178428 are actually 1.3, 0.7, 0.95, 1.2, and 0.6, respectively. <P />The position of the main sequence in Figures 1 and 2 is also slightly different from the one used in the rest of the paper. Corrected versions appear here. <P />These changes have no effect on the other figures, arguments, or conclusions in the paper. <P />I thank Gregory W. Henry for calling these errors to my attention., New deep, high-resolution Hα imagery from the UK Schmidt Telescope (UKST) Unit's Hα survey of the Southern Galactic Plane reveals the presence of a faint, highly circular, planetary nebula (PN) surrounding a very long-period variable star (now known as V1018 Sco), first discovered as a 1612-MHz OH maser, OH354.88-0.54. The nebular phase-lag distance, diameter and radial velocity are 3.2 kpc, 0.3 pc and 13 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. Combining the maser attributes with near-, mid- and far-infrared data and with our optical spectrum of the ring we conclude that the object was an intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star (initial stellar mass &gt;= 4M<SUB>solar</SUB>) in which the fast wind has recently turned on, ionizing previously shed circumstellar material. Hence, we speculate that we may be witnessing a hitherto unobserved phase of PN evolution, in which a PN has only recently started to form around a star that is unequivocally still in its AGB phase., An existing array of underwater, large-bandwidth acoustic sensors has been used to study the detection of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos in cosmic rays. Acoustic data from a subset of seven hydrophones located at a depth of ~1600 m have been acquired for a total live time of 195 days. For the first time, a large sample of acoustic background events has been studied for the purpose of extracting signals from super-EeV showers. As a test of the technique, an upper limit for the flux of UHE neutrinos is presented, along with considerations relevant to the design of an acoustic array optimized for neutrino detection., Multiwavelength observations of Galactic black hole (GBH) transients during state transitions and in the low/hard state may provide detailed information on the accretion structure of these systems. The object 4U 1543-47 is a GBH transient that was covered exceptionally well in X-rays and the infrared (daily observations) and reasonably well in the optical and radio during its outburst decay in 2002. When all the available information is gathered from the intermediate and the low/hard states, 4U 1543-47 makes an important contribution to our understanding of state transitions and the role of outflows in the high-energy emission properties of black hole binaries. The evolution of the X-ray spectral and temporal properties and the infrared light curve place strong constraints on different models to explain the overall emission from accreting black holes. The overall spectral energy distribution is consistent with a synchrotron origin for the optical and infrared emission; however, the X-ray flux is above the power-law continuation of the optical and infrared flux. The infrared light curve, the HEXTE light curve, and the evolution of the X-ray photon index indicate that the major source of hard X-rays cannot be direct synchrotron radiation from an acceleration region in a jet for most of the outburst decay., We present a second-order Godunov algorithm for multidimensional, ideal MHD. Our algorithm is based on the unsplit formulation of Colella (J. Comput. Phys. 87, 1990), with all of the primary dependent variables centered at the same location. To properly represent the divergence-free condition of the magnetic fields, we apply a discrete projection to the intermediate values of the field at cell faces, and apply a filter to the primary dependent variables at the end of each time step. We test the method against a suite of linear and nonlinear tests to ascertain accuracy and stability of the scheme under a variety of conditions. The test suite includes rotated planar linear waves, MHD shock tube problems, low-beta flux tubes, and a magnetized rotor problem. For all of these cases, we observe that the algorithm is second-order accurate for smooth solutions, converges to the correct weak solution for problems involving shocks, and exhibits no evidence of instability or loss of accuracy due to the possible presence of non-solenoidal fields., We construct the new Minimal Standard Model that incorporates the new discoveries of physics beyond the Minimal Standard Model (MSM): dark energy, non-baryonic dark matter, neutrino masses, as well as baryon asymmetry and cosmic inflation, adopting the principle of minimal particle content and the most general renormalizable Lagrangian. We base the model purely on empirical facts rather than aesthetics. We need only six new degrees of freedom beyond the MSM. It is free from excessive flavor-changing effects, CP violation, too-rapid proton decay, problems with electroweak precision data, and unwanted cosmological relics. Any model of physics beyond the MSM should be measured against the phenomenological success of this model., We investigate the initial mass function and mass segregation in super star cluster M82-F with high-resolution Keck NIRSPEC echelle spectroscopy. Cross-correlation with template supergiant spectra provides the velocity dispersion of the cluster, enabling measurement of the kinematic (virial) mass of the cluster when combined with sizes from NICMOS and Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) images. We find a mass of 6.6+/-0.9×10<SUP>5</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB> based on near-IR light and 7.0+/-1.2×10<SUP>5</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB> based on optical light. Using PSF-fitting photometry, we derive the cluster's light-to-mass (L/M) ratio in both near-IR and optical light and compare to population-synthesis models. The ratios are inconsistent with a normal stellar initial mass function for the adopted age of 40-60 Myr, suggesting a deficiency of low-mass stars within the volume sampled. King model light profile fits to new Hubble Space Telescope ACS images of M82-F, in combination with fits to archival near-IR images, indicate mass segregation in the cluster. As a result, the virial mass represents a lower limit on the mass of the cluster. <P />Based on observations made at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation., We study conditions for the existence of asymptotic observables in cosmology. With the exception of de Sitter space, the thermal properties of accelerating universes permit arbitrarily long observations, and guarantee the production of accessible states of arbitrarily large entropy. This suggests that some asymptotic observables may exist, despite the presence of an event horizon. Comparison with decelerating universes shows surprising similarities: Neither type suffers from the limitations encountered in de Sitter space, such as thermalization and boundedness of entropy. However, we argue that no realistic cosmology permits the global observations associated with an S matrix., We report new and highly accurate quantum mechanical calculations of the astrophysically interesting scattering of H<SUP>+</SUP> by H atoms. The effects of the quantum indistinguishability of the two protons are treated consistently throughout, including the calculation of the momentum transfer cross section where elastic scattering and charge transfer cannot be separated at low energies. We are able to resolve the numerous oscillations in the energy variation of the angle-integrated cross sections. With decreasing energy below 1 eV, the oscillations grow in amplitude until a smooth, approximately 1/v<SUP>2</SUP> dependence on velocity is reached below 10<SUP>-5</SUP> eV. The 1/v behavior, traditionally associated with a constant Langevin rate coefficient, is never realized down to the lowest energy calculated (10<SUP>-10</SUP> eV). We use the momentum transfer cross section to calculate accurately the transport rate coefficient that characterizes the drag force between ionic and neutral fluids and the strength of ambipolar diffusion heating for temperatures and ion-neutral drift speeds relevant for astrophysical applications. An early fit of this rate coefficient by Draine is sustained except at low energies. The application of these results to the role of ambipolar diffusion in heating jets from young stellar objects is discussed., The ion microprobe has the capability to generate high resolution, high precision isotopic measurements, but analysis of the isotopic composition of strontium, as measured by the <SUP>87</SUP>Sr/ <SUP>86</SUP>Sr ratio, has been hindered by isobaric interferences. Here we report the first high precision measurements of <SUP>87</SUP>Sr/ <SUP>86</SUP>Sr by ion microprobe in calcium carbonate samples with moderate Sr concentrations. We use the high mass resolving power (7000 to 9000 M.R.P.) of the SHRIMP-RG ion microprobe in combination with its high transmission to reduce the number of interfering species while maintaining sufficiently high count rates for precise isotopic measurements. The isobaric interferences are characterized by peak modeling and repeated analyses of standards. We demonstrate that by sample-standard bracketing, <SUP>87</SUP>Sr/ <SUP>86</SUP>Sr ratios can be measured in inorganic and biogenic carbonates with Sr concentrations between 400 and 1500 ppm with ∼2‰ external precision (2σ) for a single analysis, and subpermil external precision with repeated analyses. Explicit correction for isobaric interferences (peak-stripping) is found to be less accurate and precise than sample-standard bracketing. Spatial resolution is ∼25 μm laterally and 2 μm deep for a single analysis, consuming on the order of 2 ng of material. The method is tested on otoliths from salmon to demonstrate its accuracy and utility. In these growth-banded aragonitic structures, one-week temporal resolution can be achieved. The analytical method should be applicable to other calcium carbonate samples with similar Sr concentrations., In the waveform inversion for global 3-D heterogeneous mantle structure, it is critical to accurately compute the perturbation of synthetic seismograms caused by the crustal heterogeneities. In actual applications, to reduce the required CPU time, a weak form equation of motion in terms of global trial functions is widely used. For those trial functions, the principal difficulty is how to compute the effect of the perturbation in the location of boundaries (such as Moho and the surface). In previous studies, the formulation has been based on the first-order perturbation theory of the free oscillation. However, this method holds only for weakly heterogeneous media and for lower frequencies. In this study, we derive the exact weak form elastic equation of motion for finite boundary perturbations. Our method can be applied to arbitrary strongly heterogeneous media and to arbitrary frequencies, and should facilitates accurate crustal correction., We present Interplanetary Network (IPN) detection and localization information for 211 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observed as untriggered events by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) and published in catalogs by Kommers et al. and Stern et al. IPN confirmations have been obtained by analyzing the data from 11 experiments. For any given burst observed by BATSE and one other distant spacecraft, arrival time analysis (or ``triangulation'') results in an annulus of possible arrival directions whose half-width varies between 14"" and 5.6d, depending on the intensity, time history, and arrival direction of the burst, as well as the distance between the spacecraft. This annulus generally intersects the BATSE error circle, resulting in a reduction of the area of up to a factor of ~650. When three widely separated spacecraft observed a burst, the result is an error box whose area is as much as 30,000 times smaller than that of the BATSE error circle. Because the IPN instruments are considerably less sensitive than BATSE, they generally did not detect the weakest untriggered bursts but did detect the more intense ones, which failed to trigger BATSE when the trigger was disabled. In a few cases, we have been able to identify the probable origin of bursts as soft gamma repeaters. The vast majority of the IPN-detected events, however, are GRBs, and the confirmation of them validates many of the procedures utilized to detect BATSE untriggered bursts., We construct models of core-collapse supernovae in one spatial dimension, including rotation, angular momentum transport, and viscous dissipation employing an α-prescription. We compare the evolution of a fiducial 11 M<SUB>solar</SUB> nonrotating progenitor with its evolution when including a wide range of imposed initial rotation profiles (1.25s&lt;P<SUB>0</SUB>&lt;8 s, where P<SUB>0</SUB> is the initial, approximately solid-body, rotation period of the iron core). This range of P<SUB>0</SUB> covers the region of parameter space from where rotation begins to modify the dynamics (P<SUB>0</SUB>~8 s) to where angular velocities at collapse approach Keplerian (P<SUB>0</SUB>~1 s). Under the assumption of strict angular momentum conservation, all models in this range leave behind neutron stars with spin periods &lt;~10 ms, shorter than those of most radio pulsars but similar to those expected theoretically for magnetars at birth. A fraction of the gravitational binding energy of collapse is stored in the free energy of differential rotation. This energy source may be tapped by viscous processes, providing a mechanism for energy deposition that is not strongly coupled to the mass accretion rate through the stalled supernova shock. This effect yields qualitatively new dynamics in models of supernovae. We explore several potential mechanisms for viscosity in the core-collapse environment: neutrino viscosity, turbulent viscosity caused by the magnetorotational instability (MRI), and turbulent viscosity by entropy- and composition gradient-driven convection. We argue that the MRI is the most effective. We find for rotation periods in the range P<SUB>0</SUB>&lt;~5 s and a range of viscous stresses that the postbounce dynamics is significantly affected by the inclusion of this extra energy deposition mechanism; in several cases we obtain strong supernova explosions., A phase-sensitive sum-frequency vibrational spectroscopic technique is developed to study interfacial water structure of water/quartz interfaces. Measurements allow deduction of both real and imaginary parts of the surface nonlinear spectral response, revealing an unprecedentedly detailed picture of the net polar orientations of the water species at the interface. The orientations of the icelike and liquidlike species appear to respond very differently to the bulk pH change indicating the existence of different surface sites on quartz with different deprotonation pK values., We present high-quality data of Saturn and its ring system from the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association and Owens Valley Radio Observatory arrays. We observed at wavelengths of 1.3 and 3.0 mm in 2002 October and 2003 March, respectively. At that time Saturn's rings were near their maximum ring opening angle (|B|~26<SUP>deg</SUP>), which allowed us to map the brightness distribution on Saturn's disk, as well as from its rings, despite the moderate resolution achieved (~2.5""-4""). Clear latitudinal structure is seen on Saturn's disk, indicative of an overall upwelling of gas on the southern hemisphere and subsidence of dry air in the north. The rings are brighter at 1.3 mm than at 3.0 mm, as expected from the increase in ring particles' thermal emission at shorter wavelengths. We use our radiative transfer code to model the relative contributions of the scattered and thermal radiation emanating from the rings. Unlike previous (centimetric) observations, the present (millimetric) data serve as an adequate test of the model's ability to account for the thermal contribution from the rings. A comparison between the model and data shows that Saturn's light transmitted and scattered through the B ring, as well as the radiation reflected from the A ring behind and just off the planet's south pole, is much brighter than predicted by our model. Hence, the ring particles appear to scatter more efficiently both in the forward and backward directions than implied by an isotropic phase function., Despite several spacecraft encounters and numerous groundbased investigations, we still do not know much about Jupiter's deep atmosphere; in fact, the Galileo probe results were so different than anyone had anticipated, that we understand even less about this planet's atmosphere now than before the Galileo mission. We formulate four basic questions in Section 1.3, which, if solved, would help to better understand the chemistry and dynamics in Jupiter's atmosphere. We believe that three out of the four questions (explanation of NH <SUB>3</SUB> altitude profile, characterization of hot spots, altitude below which the atmosphere is uniformly mixed) may be solved from passive sounding of Jupiter's deep (∼ tens of bars) atmosphere via a radio telescope orbiting the planet. Question nr. 4 (the water abundance in Jupiter's deep atmosphere) has been singled out by the Solar System Exploration Decadal Survey as a key question, since the water abundance in Jupiter's deep atmosphere is tied in with planet formation models. In this paper we investigate the sensitivity of microwave retrievals to the composition of Jupiter's deep atmosphere, in particular the water abundance. Based upon present uncertainties in the ammonia abundance and other known and unknown absorbers, including uncertainties in clouds (density and index of refraction), and uncertainties in the thermal structure and lineshape profiles, we conclude that the retrieval of water at depth from microwave spectra (disk-averaged and locally) will be highly uncertain. We show that, if the H <SUB>2</SUB>O lineshape profile would be accurately known (laboratory data are needed!), an atmosphere with a near-solar H <SUB>2</SUB>O abundance can likely be distinguished from one with an abundance of 10-20×solar O based upon the difference in their microwave spectra at wavelengths ≳50 cm. This would be sufficient to distinguish between some proposed scenarios by which Jupiter acquired its inventory of volatile elements heavier than helium. If, in addition, limb-darkening measurements are obtained (again, the H <SUB>2</SUB>O lineshape profile should be known), tighter constraints on the H <SUB>2</SUB>O abundance can be obtained (see also Janssen et al., 2004, this issue)., In this paper we investigate the environment and reionization process around the highest redshift QSOs having Gunn-Peterson troughs (z&gt;6.1). Starting with the cosmic density perturbation and structure formation theory and the fact that the highest redshift QSOs are located in rare overdense regions, we show that the halo formation, gas distribution, and star formation around QSOs are biased from those of the cosmic average. We argue that a significant fraction of hydrogen in the Strömgren sphere around QSOs is ionized by photons from stars and that only about several percent to at most 10%-20% of the total hydrogen is left (e.g., in minihalos, halos, or high-density subregions) to be ionized by QSO photons. The cosmic average neutral hydrogen fraction at z~6.2-6.4 should also be smaller than the upper limit of 10%-20% and may be only a few percent. We analyze the clumping property of the hydrogen ionized by QSOs and study the evolution of the Strömgren sphere. We find that the expected Strömgren radii from our models are consistent with observations if the lifetime of the highest redshift QSOs is about or longer than afew×10<SUP>7</SUP> yr (as is the lifetime of the main population of QSOs, with comoving number density peaked at z~2-3). With such a QSO lifetime, the ages of most of the observed QSOs are long enough that the QSO photon emission is balanced by the recombination of the hydrogen ionized by QSO photons in their Strömgren spheres, and the expected Strömgren radii from the balance are independent of the detailed values of the QSO ages. We also point out a statistical method involving a larger sample of QSOs having Gunn-Peterson troughs in future observations, which may potentially check or rule out the possibility that the highest redshift QSOs have a shorter lifetime (e.g., &lt;10<SUP>7</SUP> yr), even without an accurate estimate of the hydrogen clumping property., The availability of new accurate radio flux densities of Jupiter in and around the λ≃1.3 cm ammonia absorption band, one from ground-based radio data and five from the WMAP satellite, permits re-examination of the structure of the jovian upper troposphere. These flux densities, with accuracies of 1-3%, indicate that the jovian atmospheric ammonia is globally subsaturated within and above the ammonia cloud tops, 0.4 bar⩽P⩽0.6 bar, and subsolar (by a factor of 2) below the cloud base, 0.6 bar⩽P⩽2 bar., , Deep-sea coral communities have long been recognized by fisherman as areas that support large populations of commercial fish. As a consequence, many deep-sea coral communities are threatened by bottom trawling. Successful management and conservation of this widespread deep-sea habitat requires knowledge of the age and growth rates of deep-sea corals. These organisms also contain important archives of intermediate and deep-water variability, and are thus of interest in the context of decadal to century-scale climate dynamics. Here, we present Δ<SUP>14</SUP>C data that suggest that bamboo corals from the Gulf of Alaska are long-lived (75-126 years) and that they acquire skeletal carbon from two distinct sources. Independent verification of our growth rate estimates and coral ages is obtained by counting seasonal Sr/Ca cycles and probable lunar cycle growth bands., The bulk redistribution of plasma in the near-Earth space environment during the onset and main phase of a magnetic storm has been observed on a global scale with 2-minute resolution using Far-Ultraviolet images from the NASA-IMAGE satellite and ground-based total electron content (TEC) maps using Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) receivers. The dynamic variations under the storm conditions show a redistribution of plasma away from the nominal low-latitude location of the equatorial ionospheric anomalies, resulting in peak nightside ionospheric densities at middle latitudes. A zonal redistribution of plasma is also evident, as the plasma is depleted across the Atlantic sector, while TEC values grow in the Caribbean sector to the largest values on the nightside. The ground-based GPS measurements provide 24-hour observations of TEC, while the FUV measurements provide nightside observation with greater spatial resolution, continuous over land and sea. The complimentary observations are shown to have a very good correspondence, promising new analyses of storm time plasma redistribution with high temporal and spatial resolution and greatly improved global coverage., We report in situ observations from the Cluster and FAST spacecraft showing the deposition of energy into the auroral ionosphere from broadband ULF waves in the cusp and low-latitude boundary layer. A comparison of the wave Poynting flux with particle energy and flux at both satellites indicates that energy transfer from the broadband waves to the plasma occurs through field-aligned electron acceleration, transverse ion acceleration, and Joule heating. These processes are shown to result in precipitating electron fluxes sufficient to drive bright aurora and cause outflows of energized electrons and O<SUP>+</SUP> ions from the ionosphere into the low-latitude boundary layer. By solving an eigenmode equation for Alfvén waves in the observed plasma environment, it is shown that the broadband waves observed at Cluster and FAST are dispersive Alfvén waves. It is demonstrated that these waves have wavelengths perpendicular to the geomagnetic field extending from significant fractions of an L shell down to ion gyroradii and electron inertial lengths and wave frequencies in the plasma frame from 1 mHz up to 50 mHz. These waves are shown to have wavelengths along the geomagnetic field of the order of the field line length between the ionosphere and the equatorial plane and become field line resonances (FLRs) when on closed field lines. It is shown that the inclusion of nonlinear and/or nonlocal kinetic effects is required in the description of these waves to account for accelerated particles observed. On the basis of the wave polarization and spectral properties observed from Cluster and FAST it is speculated that these waves are generated through the mode conversion of surface Alfvén waves driven by tailward flows in the low-latitude boundary layer., Using ultraviolet images from two global auroral imagers, IMAGE FUV in the northern hemisphere and Polar UVI in the south, we present the first synoptic scale conjugate observations of the dayside aurora. We find that the morphology of the afternoon aurora is significantly different in the two hemispheres. Multiple spots in a ``string of pearls'' configuration are seen in the southern hemisphere while the northern aurora is unstructured. We relate the observed asymmetry in the aurora to the Y GSM component of the IMF: a strong IMF B<SUB>Y</SUB> modifies the ionospheric convection and field aligned current patterns, leading to the auroral asymmetry. Additionally, we suggest that the instability giving rise to the multiple spot morphology occurs at low altitude., We give a brief introduction to the physics of spin-dependent WIMP interactions and report the results of an analysis of recent data sets from the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) in terms of spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon interactions on 73Ge and 29Si. The primary data are from the first run of CDMS at the Soudan Underground Laboratory, and data from a prior run at the Stanford Underground Facility (6.6 raw kg-day Si exposure at 20 mwe) are used to extend our reach in the case of low WIMP mass. These data exclude new regions of spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon interaction parameter space. The parameter space explored is relevant to spin-dependent interpretations of the annual modulation signal reported by the DAMA experiment, but does not yet probe preferred regions of supergravity parameter space., Stratospheric photochemistry leads to anomalous oxygen isotope enrichments in CO<SUB>2</SUB> (for which Δ<SUP>17</SUP>O = δ<SUP>17</SUP>O - 0.516 × δ<SUP>18</SUP>O ≠ 0). This isotope anomaly is not lost until air returns to the troposphere and CO<SUB>2</SUB> undergoes isotope exchange with water primarily in the terrestrial biosphere and oceans. A two-box model is used to investigate the contribution of stratospheric production and contemporary surface carbon fluxes to tropospheric Δ<SUP>17</SUP>O<SUB>CO2</SUB>. The predicted magnitude of ~0.15‰ is large enough that measurement of a globally averaged tropospheric Δ<SUP>17</SUP>O<SUB>CO2</SUB> should provide a new constraint for gross carbon exchanges between the biosphere and atmosphere in terrestrial carbon cycle models. Importantly, Δ<SUP>17</SUP>O<SUB>CO2</SUB> should be complementary to the primary isotopic tracer of gross carbon exchanges, δ<SUP>18</SUP>O<SUB>CO2</SUB>, but is not dependent on numerous hydrologic variables. Furthermore, with improved measurement precision, Δ<SUP>17</SUP>O<SUB>CO2</SUB> could serve as a direct tracer of gross carbon exchanges and their variations., We report multiple Doppler measurements of five nearby FGK main-sequence stars and subgiants obtained during the past 4-6 yr at the Keck Observatory. These stars, namely, HD 183263, HD 117207, HD 188015, HD 45350, and HD 99492, all exhibit coherent variations in their Doppler shifts consistent with a planet in Keplerian motion. The five new planets occupy known realms of planetary parameter space, including a wide range of orbital eccentricities, e=0-0.78, and semimajor axes, 0.1-3.8 AU, that provide further statistical information about the true distributions of various properties of planetary systems. One of the planets, HD 99492b, has a low minimum mass of 0.112M<SUB>Jup</SUB>=36M<SUB>Earth</SUB>. Four of the five planets orbit beyond 1 AU. We describe two quantitative tests of the false alarm probability for Keplerian interpretations of measured velocities. The more robust of these involves Monte Carlo realizations of scrambled velocities as a proxy for noise. Keplerian orbital fits to that ``noise'' yield the distribution of χ<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>ν</SUB> to compare with χ<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>ν</SUB> from the original (unscrambled) velocities. We establish a 1% false alarm probability as the criterion for candidate planets. All five of these planet-bearing stars are metal-rich, with [Fe/H]&gt;+0.27, reinforcing the strong correlation between planet occurrence and metallicity. From the full sample of 1330 stars monitored at Keck, Lick, and the Anglo-Australian Telescope, the shortest orbital period for any planet is 2.64 days, showing that shorter periods occur less frequently than 0.1% in the solar neighborhood. Photometric observations were acquired for four of the five host stars with an automatic telescope at Fairborn Observatory. The lack of brightness variations in phase with the radial velocities supports planetary-reflex motion as the cause of the velocity variations. No transits were observed, but their occurrence is not ruled out by our observations. <P />Based on observations obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated jointly by the University of California and the California Institute of Technology. Keck time has been granted by both NASA and the University of California., , An early result of galaxy formation theory was the prediction that the copious ionizing radiation produced in nascent galaxies undergoing their first starbursts should in turn produce a strong Lya emission line. We report on our efforts to detect and characterize primeval galaxies by searching for this expected Lya signature with two observational techniques: serendipitous slit spectroscopy, and narrowband imaging selection. In Part I, we describe our serendipitous slit spectroscopy survey of the Hubble Deep Field and its environs, which resulted in a catalog of 74 spectroscopic redshifts spanning 0.10 &lt; z &lt; 5.77, including a galaxy cluster at z = 0.85 and five galaxies <P />at z &gt; 5. Follow-up observations at higher resolution resulted in the additional serendipitous detection of a strong Lya-emitting galaxy at z = 5.190 (ES1). At the time of its discovery, ES1 was one of only nine known galaxies at z &gt; 5, and was the sixth most distant known galaxy. The unprecedented spectral purity of the observation offers evidence for a galaxy-scale outflow with a. velocity of v &gt; 300 km s -1 , consistent with wind speeds observed in powerful local starbursts (typically 10 2 to 10 3 km s -1 ), and with simulations of the late- stage evolution of Lya emission in star-forming systems. Our final serendipitous detection is the remarkable source CXOHDFN J123635.6+621424, which is both the highest redshift known spiral galaxy, and a rare example of a high redshift, hard X-ray-emitting Type II AGN. Significantly, all of these results were acquired with no direct allocation of telescope time. <P />In Part II, we report on our implementation of narrowband imaging selection, with which we traded redshift coverage for survey volume, focusing on the systematic study of galaxies at a particular epoch in favor of chasing that rare, most-distant object. This effort resulted in a catalog of 76 z [approximate] 4.5 Lya-emitting galaxies spectroscopically-confirmed in campaigns of Keck/LRIS and Keck/DEIMOS follow-up observations to candidates selected in the Large Area Lyman Alpha (LALA) survey. We conclude that if there is evolution in the Lya luminosity function over these epochs, its significance is below the statistical uncertainty of these data. This result supports the conclusion from several smaller samples of high-redshift Lya---emitters that the intergalactic medium remains largely reionized from the local universe out to z [approximate] 6.5. However, it is somewhat at odds with the pronounced drop in the cosmic star formation rate density recently measured between z ~ 3 and z ~ 6 in Lyman-break galaxies, and therefore potentially sheds light on the relationship between the two populations. (Abstract shortened by UMI.), This thesis presents a measurement of O m and O L from a blind analysis of 21 high redshift supernovae using a new technique (CMAGIC) for fitting the multi- color lightcurves of Type Ia supernovae, first introduced in Wang et al. (2003b). CMAGIC takes advantage of the remarkably simple behavior of Type Ia supernovae on color-magnitude diagrams, and has several advantages over previous techniques based on maximum magnitudes. Among these are a reduced sensitivity to host galaxy dust extinction, a shallower luminosity-width relation, and the relative simplicity of the fitting procedure. This technique can be used to cross check previous supernova cosmology results using currently existing data, despite the fact that these data sets were not observed in a manner optimized for CMAGIC. Because this analysis is being compared with a previous result, it is particularly important that the expectation of consistency does not introduce a bias into the analysis. To this end, a blind analysis has been performed, the first time that such a technique has been applied to the use of supernovae to measure the cosmological parameters. <P />Application of CMAGIC yields a measurement[Special characters omitted.] (statistical errors only), broadly confirming previous supernova measurements which indicated that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating. O m and O L are extremely correlated in this measurement, so the results are better stated in the principal axes frame of the resulting error ellipse:[Special characters omitted.] The systematic error has been estimated by considering alterations to the primary fit. The CMAGIC fit can also be directly compared with a fit using more traditional methods (the magnitude at B maximum, m B ) using the same set of supernovae. The CMAGIC results favor an accelerating Universe even more strongly than the m B results at the 1.6s level., Observations of hard X-ray (HXR)/γ-ray continuum and γ-ray lines produced by energetic electrons and ions, respectively, colliding with the solar atmosphere, have shown that large solar flares can accelerate ions up to many GeV and electrons up to hundreds of MeV. Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are observed by spacecraft near 1 AU and by ground-based instrumentation to extend up to similar energies as in large SEP events, but it appears that a different acceleration process, one associated with fast coronal mass ejections is responsible. Much weaker SEP events are observed that are generally rich in electrons, <SUP>3</SUP>He, and heavy elements. The energetic particles in these events appear to be similar to those accelerated in flares. The Ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager (RHESSI) mission provides high-resolution spectroscopy and imaging of flare HXRs and γ-rays. Such observations can provide information on the location, energy spectra, and composition of the flare accelerated energetic particles at the Sun. Here, preliminary comparisons of the RHESSI observations with observations of both energetic electron and ion near 1 AU are reviewed, and the implications for the particle acceleration and escape processes are discussed., Our galaxy is filled with a “gas” of relativistic nuclei and electrons - the galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). The source of GCR nuclei is unknown, but there is a general consensus among high-energy astrophysicists that GCRs are accelerated by supernova (SN) shocks in the interstellar medium. The evidence in support of this picture is strong but indirect. However, the fact that the cosmic-ray spectrum extends continuously, without steps or peaks, to more than five orders of magnitude in energy beyond the limit of SN shock acceleration appears to be incompatible with this picture, at least without extreme fine-tuning of models. A “smoking gun” is needed to definitively establish that SN shocks are indeed the accelerator of GCRs. If GCRs are accelerated in SN shocks, they will be enhanced in freshly-synthesized r-process material. We are currently studying the R-process Isotope Observer (RIO) as a Mission of Opportunity for the International Space Station. RIO will make the first measurements of the isotopic abundances of the “ultraheavy” GCRs (those in the range 32 ⩽ Z ⩽ 42) and will determine the fractional contribution of freshly-synthesized r-process material in GCRs through the measurement of several key isotopic ratios., We consider the effects of an outflow on radiation escaping from the infalling envelope around a massive protostar. Using numerical radiative transfer calculations, we show that outflows with properties comparable to those observed around massive stars lead to significant anisotropy in the stellar radiation field, which greatly reduces the radiation pressure experienced by gas in the infalling envelope. This means that radiation pressure is a much less significant barrier to massive star formation than has previously been thought., Star formation in starburst galaxies is concentrated in dense, massive knots of stars called super star clusters (SSCs). These clusters may represent the building blocks of galaxies, and determining their properties is key to understanding the formation, enrichment and evolution of galaxies. SSCs are coeval stellar populations with sufficient stars to sample extensively the cluster initial mass function (IMF). Critical to characterization of the IMF is the detection of low-mass stars, the light of which is swamped by high- luminosity supergiants. <P />The nuclear starburst in M82 contains roughly two dozen SSCs that are prominent in the near-infrared, with typical ages of ~10 7 years. The light of these young SSCs is dominated by red supergiant stars. I use high-spectral-resolution near-infrared Keck/NIRSPEC spectroscopy to measure the stellar velocity dispersions of these clusters, and find line-of-sight dispersions of s ~ 7--35 km s -1 . From King model fits to light profiles in HST/NICMOS images, I determine that the clusters are typically 1--3 pc in radius, and measure the photometry and luminosities of the SSCs. I apply the virial theorem to derive masses for 15 SSCs in the nuclear starburst; all lie in the range of 10 5 to 10 7 solar masses. This dataset represents the largest study to date of SSC virial masses in a single galaxy. <P />The nature of the ultraluminous x-ray (ULX) sources that are closely associated with star formation and SSCs is the cause of much current debate. One possibility is that ULXs are accreting intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). Formation theories for IMBHs in SSCs focus on the role of stellar collisions and mergers in the dense environs of a cluster core. The key question is whether a runaway star of sufficient mass can form via collisions before the population of massive stars is depleted by supernova explosions. I identify several M82 clusters with dynamical friction timescales of less than 5 Myr; high-spatial-resolution x-ray observations of these clusters may uncover additional compact x-ray sources. (Abstract shortened by UMI.), , Flow of the mid-crust in the Tibetan Plateau may strongly influence the patterns of deformation and topography within this area. This flow requires the lower-crust to have low viscosity and so quantifying this viscosity may be used to test the idea of channel flow. An application of Bayesian methods to geologic and geodetic data from north central Tibet yields lower-crustal viscosities (assumed Newtonian) of 1 × 10<SUP>19</SUP> Pa s and 2 × 10<SUP>21</SUP> Pa s (95% bounds). The lower bound is larger than the value of 10<SUP>16</SUP>-10<SUP>18</SUP> Pa s required by models of flow of the lower-crust of Tibet, unless the entire lower crust participates in channel flow., We examine the effect of the collective force due to coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) in an electron storage ring with small bending radius. In a computation based on time-domain integration of the nonlinear Vlasov equation, we find the threshold current for a longitudinal microwave instability induced by CSR alone. The model accounts for suppression of radiation at long wavelengths due to shielding by the vacuum chamber. In a calculation just above threshold, small ripples in the charge distribution build up over a fraction of a synchrotron period, but then die out to yield a relatively smooth but altered distribution with eventual oscillations in bunch length. The instability evolves from small noise on an initial smooth bunch of rms length much greater than the shielding cutoff., Photochemistry of acetylene (C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB>) and the subsequent reactions of the ethynyl radical (C<SUB>2</SUB>H) have been shown to play an important role in the formation of complex organic molecules in planetary atmospheres and especially in Titan's atmosphere. There have been relatively few kinetic investigations of reactions with the ethynyl radical at low temperature (down to 70 K) because of their experimental difficulty. We have developed (Lee et al. 2000) a pulsed Laval apparatus coupled to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer to study experimentally the gas phase chemistry (reaction kinetics and product distributions) of the C<SUB>2</SUB>H radical with several molecules involved in Titan's Atmosphere. This apparatus generates a pulsed and uniform low temperature gas flow down to 70 K. Radiation from a 193 nm pulsed laser is used to generate the C<SUB>2</SUB>H radical coaxially down the length of the expansion by photolysis of acetylene. The reaction kinetics is followed in the flow by measuring the chemiluminescence of excited CH(A<SUP>2</SUP>Σ) formed in the reaction of C<SUB>2</SUB>H with O<SUB>2</SUB>. Our experiment has provided new kinetic rate coefficients for the C<SUB>2</SUB>H radical with four-carbon-atom neutral hydrocarbons (isobutane, 1-butene, isobutylene and 1,3-butadiene). These reactions are rapid (a rate coefficient greater than 1 × 10<SUP>-10</SUP> cm<SUP>3</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> at 10<SUP>4</SUP> K) and will soon be included into atmospheric models. Studies of the kinetics of reactions of the ethynyl radical with nitrogen-containing species (CH<SUB>3</SUB>CN, C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>5</SUB>CN and C<SUB>3</SUB>H<SUB>7</SUB>CN) in Titan's atmospheric temperature range (Nizamov &amp; Leone 2004a, Nizamov &amp; Leone 2004b) indicate that the rate coefficients decrease monotonically as the temperature is lowered. The rate constant is small relative to the rate constants for C<SUB>2</SUB>H reactions with more abundant hydrocarbons, indicating that those reactions with nitrogen-containing species account for a very small fraction of the C<SUB>2</SUB>H removal by chemical reactions. Studies of the isotopic effects on the C<SUB>2</SUB>H + NH<SUB>3</SUB>/ND<SUB>3</SUB>, C<SUB>2</SUB>H/C<SUB>2</SUB>D + O<SUB>2</SUB> and C<SUB>2</SUB>H/C<SUB>2</SUB>D + C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB>/C<SUB>2</SUB>D<SUB>2</SUB> reactions were performed. Those results show a large kinetic isotope effect only for the reaction with NH<SUB>3</SUB>, confirming that the hydrogen abstraction channel is one of the possible mechanisms for this reaction. The study of expensive gases like deuterated species is permitted due to the very small gas quantities used during the pulsed injection of gas. New experiments will provide important information about the first chemical step in Titan's haze formation: in atmospheric models the reaction of benzene with ethynyl radical is one of the ways of promoting the propagation of PAH formation (Wilson &amp; Atreya 2003). This reaction is studied in our experiment down to 100 K. The detection of the products is allowed for the first time at such low temperatures by sampling the gas stream and using a 118 nm ionization laser and time-of-flight mass spectrometer., The spatial distribution of Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) in 2:1 exterior resonance with Neptune constrains that planet's migration history. Numerical simulations demonstrate that fast planetary migration generates a larger population of KBOs trailing rather than leading Neptune in orbital longitude. This asymmetry corresponds to a greater proportion of objects caught into asymmetric resonance such that their resonance angles φ librate about values greater than π (trailing) as opposed to less than π (leading). We provide, for the first time, an explanation of this phenomenon, using physical, analytic, and semianalytic arguments. Central to our understanding is how planetary migration shifts the equilibrium points of the superposed direct and indirect potentials. Symmetric libration, in which φ librates about ~π, precedes capture into asymmetric resonance. As a particle transitions from symmetric to asymmetric libration, if φ exceeds the value ψ at the unstable point of asymmetric resonance, then the particle is caught into trailing resonance, while if φ&lt;ψ, the particle is caught into leading resonance. The probability that the KBO is caught into trailing resonance is determined by the fraction of time it spends with φ&gt;ψ while in symmetric libration. This fractional time increases with faster migration because migration not only shifts ψ to values less than π but also shifts the stable point of symmetric libration to values greater than π. Smaller eccentricities prior to capture strengthen the effect of these shifts. Large capture asymmetries appear for exponential timescales of migration τ shorter than ~10<SUP>7</SUP> yr. The observed distribution of 2:1 KBOs (two trailing and seven leading) excludes τ&lt;=10<SUP>6</SUP> yr with 99.65% confidence., Deep imaging in the rest-frame UV has constrained both the evolution of the cosmic star formation rate density [1] and its time integral, the growth of the cosmic stellar mass density [2]. Short-wavelength studies give an incomplete picture, however, since an important population of high-redshift galaxies is heavily dust-obscured. The strength of the extragalactic mid- and far-IR/submillimeter background indicates that about half of the cosmic energy density comes from dusty luminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs/ULIRGs: L<SUB>IR</SUB> ~ 10<SUP>11.5</SUP> to 10<SUP>13.5</SUP> L<SUB>⊙</SUB>) at z ≥ 1 [3,4]. Because the brightest of these submillimeter galaxies (SMGs; see [5] and references therein) tend to lack strong X-ray emission [6], their large IR luminosities probably correspond to high star formation rates [7]. As the strikingly different appearances of the Hubble Deep Field at 0.83 μm [8] and 850 μm [9] exemplify, SMGs are rarer and forming stars much more intensely than typical optically selected systems [8,9]. Here we discuss new observations that shed light on the importance of SMGs in the history of galaxy mass assembly (all numbers assuming a flat Ω<SUB>Λ</SUB> = 0.7 cosmology with H<SUB>0</SUB> = 70 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>)., We present analytic radiative transfer solutions for the dust continuum spectra of embedded protostars and dust-enshrouded galaxies. We develop an analytic methodology for spherically symmetric, homogeneous, centrally heated, dusty sources. We find that the dust thermal spectrum possesses scaling relations that provide a natural classification for a broad range of sources, from low- mass protostars to dusty galaxies. In particular, we find that, given our assumptions, spectral energy distributions (SEDs) can be characterized by two distance-independent parameters, the luminosity-to-mass ratio, L/M , and the surface density, SUM, for a set of two functions, namely, the density profile and the opacity curve. The functionality of our model is unique in that it provides for a self-consistent analytic solution that we have validated by comparison with a well-tested radiative transfer code (DUSTY) to find excellent agreement with numerical results over a parameter space that spans low-mass protostars to ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGS). <P />We apply this methodology to infer the physical conditions of a diverse range of astrophysical sources. For protostars, we use inside-out collapse solutions for isothermal and nonisothermal equations of state to infer the accretion rates of low, inter mediate, and massive protostars. We verify our approach by comparing our results for the source and evolutionary parameters for well- studied low-mass Class 0 protostars. We find that accretion rates of massive protostars inferred from the spectrum allow massive stars to form in 105 years within the context of the Turbulent Core Model developed by McKee &amp; Tan (2003), thereby providing observational corroboration for their model of massive star formation. For ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), we show that the millimeter to far-infrared SEDs can be well fit using the standard dust opacity index of 2 when self-consistent radiative transfer solutions are employed, indicating that the cold dust in ULIRGs can be described by a single grain model. Our approach obviates the need to use SED templates in the millimeter to far-infrared region of the spectrum; this is a common practice in the extragalactic community that relies on observed correlations established at low redshift that may not necessarily extend to high redshift. <P />We extend our solution to include an inhomogeneous distribution of dust. We show that the shape of the SED emitted by a clumpy envelope differs from that of a homogeneous envelope through one parameter, which is proportional to the optical depth of the clumps. We apply this generalized methodology to fit the millimeter to mid-infrared SEDs of a massive protostar and well-studied ULIRGs. Our analytic solution fits the high-frequency data (up to mid-infrared wavelengths) at a level comparable to recent numerical work, suggesting that the mid-infrared emission of massive protostars and dusty galaxies could be strongly influenced by the clumpiness of the dust., We argue that in the context of string theory, the usual restriction to globally hyperbolic space-times should be considerably relaxed. We exhibit an example of a space-time which only satisfies the causal condition, and so is arbitrarily close to admitting closed causal curves, but which has a well-behaved dual description, free of paradoxes., The NASA Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) satellite has obtained simultaneous near-ultraviolet (NUV) and far-ultraviolet (FUV) light curves of the ROTSE-I Catalog RR Lyrae type ab variable star J143753.84+345924.8. A series of 38 GALEX Deep Imaging Survey observations well distributed in phase within the star's 0.56432 day period shows an AB = 4.9 mag variation in the FUV (1350-1750 Å) band and an AB = 1.8 mag variation in the NUV (1750-2750 Å) band, compared with only a 0.8 mag variation in the broad, unfiltered ROTSE-I (~4500-10,000 Å) band. These GALEX UV observations are the first to reveal a large RR Lyrae amplitude variation at wavelengths below 1800 Å. We compare the GALEX and ROTSE-I observations to predictions made by recent Kurucz stellar atmosphere models. We use published physical parameters for the comparable period (0.57433 days), well-observed RR Lyrae star WY Antliae to compute predicted FUV, NUV, and ROTSE-I light curves for J143753.84+345924.8. The observed light curves agree with the Kurucz predictions for [Fe/H]=-1.25 to within AB = 0.2 mag in the GALEX NUV and ROTSE-I bands and to within 0.5 mag in the FUV. At all metallicities between solar and 1/100 solar, the Kurucz models predict 6-8 mag of variation at wavelengths between 1000 and 1700 Å. Other variable stars with similar temperature variations, such as Cepheids, should also have large-amplitude FUV light curves, observable during the ongoing GALEX imaging surveys., I investigate three related questions in the theory of star formation. First, I consider the physical mechanism of massive star formation. Massive stars reach the main sequence while still accreting from their natal clouds, leading to a huge radiation pressure force on dust grains suspended in the incoming gas. Early calculations found that this limits stellar masses to [Special characters omitted.] 20--40 [Special characters omitted.] , far smaller than the most massive stars observed. I demonstrate two new mechanisms by which accretion can continue despite radiation pressure. First, radiation holding up a massive infalling envelope is subject to Rayleigh-Taylor instability, which forces the accreting gas into optically thick filaments that are shielded from radiation and channel gas to the star. Second, massive protostars have powerful outflows that punch optically thin cavities through the envelope. These channel radiation away from the accreting gas, greatly reducing the radiation pressure force it experiences. Second, I argue that the stellar initial mass function (IMF) does not originate from the ""competitive accretion"" of unbound gas by seed protostars. I provide an approximate solution to the problem of Bondi- Hoyle accretion in a turbulent medium, and use this solution to show that the rate of competitive accretion in environments like observed star-forming regions is too low to substantially affect the masses of newborn stars. Only if star-forming clumps undergo a global collapse to a state far denser than any thus far observed is competitive accretion a viable mechanism for producing the IMF. <P />Third, I give a theoretical prediction for the star formation rate in a medium where star formation is regulated by supersonic turbulence. Starting from the approximation that stars form in any region that is sufficiently overdense for the local potential energy to exceed the turbulent kinetic energy, I derive a formula for the star formation rate in terms of the virial parameter and Mach number of a star-forming cloud. I show that this prediction is consistent with simulations, that it correctly predicts the observed star formation rate in the Milky Way, and that it reproduces the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt Law for star formation in galaxies., We report the discovery of variability in the linear polarization from the Galactic center black hole source Sagittarius A*. New polarimetry obtained with the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association array at a wavelength of 1.3 mm shows a position angle that differs by 28<SUP>deg</SUP>+/-5<SUP>deg</SUP> from observations 6 months prior and then remains stable for 15 months. This difference may be due to a change in the source emission region on a scale of 10 Schwarzschild radii or due to a change of 3×10<SUP>5</SUP> rad m<SUP>-2</SUP> in the rotation measure. We consider a change in the source physics unlikely, however, since we see no corresponding change in the total intensity or polarized intensity fraction. On the other hand, turbulence in the accretion region at a radius ~10R<SUB>S</SUB>-1000R<SUB>S</SUB> could readily account for the magnitude and timescale of the position angle change., We have derived the mean broadening profile of the star V 102 in the region of the open cluster IC 4665 from high resolution spectroscopy. At a projected equatorial rotation velocity of v sin i = (105 ± 12) km s<SUP>-1</SUP> we find strong deviation from classical rotation. We discuss several scenarios, the most plausible being strong differential rotation in latitudinal direction. For this scenario we find a difference in angular velocity of ΔΩ = 3.6 ± 0.8 rad d<SUP>-1</SUP> (ΔΩ/Ω = 0.42 ± 0.09). From the Hα line we derive a spectral type of A9 and support photometric measurements classifying IC 4665 V 102 as a non-member of IC 4665. At such early spectral type this is the strongest case of differential rotation observed so far. Together with three similar stars, IC 4665 V 102 seems to form a new class of objects that exhibit extreme latitudinal shear in a very shallow convective envelope. <P />Based on observations carried out at the European Southern Observatory, Paranal, 71.D-0127(A)., A substantial number of processes have been suggested as possible contributors to the extragalactic γ-ray background (EGRB). Yet another contribution to this background will be emission produced in hadronic interactions of cosmic-ray protons with the cluster thermal gas; this class of cosmic rays (CRs) has been shown to be responsible for the EUV emission in the Coma Cluster of galaxies. In this paper we estimate this contribution. We first derive an improved estimate of the γ-ray emission produced by this population of CRs in the Coma Cluster. We consider the impact of different strength shocks in the production of this flux. We then assume the that CRs in the Coma Cluster are prototypical of all clusters and derive the contribution to the EGRB from all clusters over time. We examine two different possibilities for the scaling of the CR flux with cluster size: the number density of the CRs scales with the number density of the thermal plasma, and alternatively, the energy density of the CRs scales with the energy density of the plasma. We find that in all scenarios the EGRB produced by this process is sufficiently low that it will not be observable in comparison with other mechanisms that are likely to produce an EGRB. Nonetheless, it is quite likely that future missions will be able to detect emission produced by this process in large clusters of galaxies. In particular, a signature of this process should be observable in the Coma Cluster with instruments on the GLAST satellite. We show that the spectral shape of this emission in the Coma Cluster may well allow a determination as to whether strong or mild shocks are primarily responsible for the production of CRs in this cluster., We investigate large-scale galactic winds driven by momentum deposition. Momentum injection is provided by (1) radiation pressure produced by the continuum absorption and scattering of photons on dust grains and (2) supernovae (momentum injection by supernovae is important even if the supernova energy is radiated away). Radiation can be produced by a starburst or active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. We argue that momentum-driven winds are an efficient mechanism for feedback during the formation of galaxies. We show that above a limiting luminosity, momentum deposition from star formation can expel a significant fraction of the gas in a galaxy. The limiting, Eddington-like luminosity is L<SUB>M</SUB>~=(4f<SUB>g</SUB>c/G)σ<SUP>4</SUP>, where σ is the galaxy velocity dispersion and f<SUB>g</SUB> is the gas fraction; the subscript M refers to momentum driving. A starburst that attains L<SUB>M</SUB> moderates its star formation rate and its luminosity does not increase significantly further. We argue that elliptical galaxies attain this limit during their growth at z&gt;~1 and that this is the origin of the Faber-Jackson relation. We show that Lyman break galaxies and ultraluminous infrared galaxies have luminosities near L<SUB>M</SUB>. Since these starbursting galaxies account for a significant fraction of the star formation at z&gt;~1, this supports our hypothesis that much of the observed stellar mass in early-type galaxies was formed during Eddington-limited star formation. Star formation is unlikely to efficiently remove gas from very small scales in galactic nuclei, i.e., scales much smaller than that of a nuclear starburst. This gas is available to fuel a central black hole (BH). We argue that a BH clears gas out of its galactic nucleus when the luminosity of the BH itself reaches ~L<SUB>M</SUB>. This shuts off the fuel supply to the BH and may also terminate star formation in the surrounding galaxy. As a result, the BH mass is fixed to be M<SUB>BH</SUB>~=(f<SUB>g</SUB>κ<SUB>es</SUB>/πG<SUP>2</SUP>)σ<SUP>4</SUP>, where κ<SUB>es</SUB> is the electron scattering opacity. This limit is in accord with the observed M<SUB>BH</SUB>-σ relation., The classical Bondi-Hoyle formula gives the accretion rate onto a point particle of a gas with a uniform density and velocity. However, the Bondi-Hoyle problem considers only gas with no net vorticity, while in a real astrophysical situation accreting gas invariably has at least a small amount of vorticity. We therefore consider the related case of accretion of gas with constant vorticity, for the cases of both small and large vorticity. We confirm the findings of earlier two-dimensional simulations that even a small amount of vorticity can substantially change both the accretion rate and the morphology of the gas flow lines. We show that in three dimensions the resulting flow field is nonaxisymmetric and time-dependent. The reduction in accretion rate is due to an accumulation of circulation near the accreting particle. Using a combination of simulations and analytic treatment, we provide an approximate formula for the accretion rate of gas onto a point particle as a function of the vorticity of the surrounding gas., One of the major surprises of the Apollo 15 &amp; 16 lunar missions was the discovery of hundreds of patches of strong remnant magnetization of the lunar crust, ranging from tens to hundreds of km scale size. Most of these regions were mapped through the serendipitously discovered electron reflection (ER) method for remote sensing of surface magnetic fields. Since then electron reflectometers have been flown on the Mars Global Surveyor and Lunar Prospector missions. We present here high sensitivity full global maps of the surface magnetic fields of both planetary bodies. Remarkably strong surface magnetic fields have been detected, especially for Mars. These detailed maps show complex structure, but the origin and history of the magnetization on both bodies still remains a mystery. Impact processes, however, are clearly important in erasing magnetism on both bodies, and may also be involved in producing magnetization on the Moon. Recently, the ER method has been used to probe of the structure of the upper Martian atmosphere. For both the Moon and Mars there is evidence for closed magnetospheres/cylinders at least some of the time, and the interaction of the solar wind with these structures can be complex. Evidence for magnetic reconnection and for non-fluid effects have been found., Using global auroral images from Polar UVI in the southern hemisphere and IMAGE FUV in the north, we have analyzed the asymmetries in the dayside aurora for a five-month period. The observed asymmetries were related to the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). Initial results suggest that the direction of the IMF plays a major role in influencing the asymmetrical behavior of the dayside aurora. When the IMF is southward and a significant dawnward component exists, there is an enhancement in the afternoon aurora in the northern hemisphere. If there is a significant duskward component to the IMF, then an enhancement in the afternoon aurora in the southern hemisphere is observed. Additionally, when the ratio of the magnitudes of the Y and Z components of the IMF are greater than about 2, distinct structure (i.e., a string of pearls configuration) is seen in the hemisphere with enhanced emission. These results are in general agreement with models and observations of the IMF influence on ionospheric convection. A strong Y component of the IMF can lead to a strong shear flow at the dayside convection reversal boundary. Strong flow shear can lead to strong field aligned currents (i.e., elelctron precipitation for upward current) in this same region. If the flow shear exceeds some threshold, an instability (e.g., a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability) can develop leading to discrete structures., We have compounded a model of the evolution of Mars' inventories of CO<SUB>2</SUB> over its lifetime [1] in an effort to understand the likely path of evolution of Mars' climate from an apparently wet early Hesperian [2], suggestive of a large inventory of free CO<SUB>2</SUB>, to what is expected to be a very low CO<SUB>2</SUB> inventory at present. Here we investigate the opportunity for diurnally averaged temperatures greater than the melting point of water on Mars during the Hesperian by utilizing sub-seasonal insolation patterns, especially during periods with high eccentricity. While recent MER Opportunity observations suggest an extensive body of water [2], observations of Hesperian valley networks suggest they are immature [3]. Hypsometric analysis [4] confirms that martian drainage basins are systematically different from terrestrial drainage basins, with very little erosion. The immaturity of martian drainage basins suggests they were formed by infrequent episodic fluvial action. Our evolutionary model was used to investigate the frequency of such episodes by incorporating obliquity and eccentricity variations consistent with recent Laskar et al. findings [5]. We develop a measure of the trend in the frequency of ponding by calculating the area-normalized fraction of degree-days above 273 K over 10 Myr time bins. Models that produce ponding in the Hesperian and reproduce the atmospheric pressure of the present show a rapid decline in ponding during the Hesperian, a result of sequestration of CO<SUB>2</SUB> into carbonate rocks.

(2004) Icarus, 170, 343., Intense fluxes of wave accelerated low energy electrons in auroras signify the location of large scale energy input from the magnetosphere. Studying these wave accelerated electron (WAE) auroras require the monitoring of the auroral dynamics by high resolution (ground- or space-based) imaging while simultaneously measuring the particles at various altitudes to determine the characteristic electron spectrum and to observe the transition of wave Poynting flux into electron energy. This wave acceleration is another distinct and presumably transient process by which magnetic energy of the magnetosphere is converted into particle (electron) energy and transmitted into the atmosphere in the form of auroral electrons. Using the FAST satellite and auroral imaging from the IMAGE spacecraft we were able to show that prior to substorm onset WAE auroras occur infrequently and mostly near the poleward boundary of the auroral oval, presumably near the boundary of open and closed field lines, where steady state reconnection is expected to occur. At onset WAE electrons play a primary role in the surge formation and the break up aurora. This aurora is located deep in the region of closed field lines. After onset the poleward propagating auroral surge consists of WAE electrons at the poleward edge of the closed field configuration and is closely followed by inverted V type precipitation. The ground based auroral imaging operating simultaneously with the future THEMIS satellites will have better spatial resolution for the investigation of the aurora associated with these processes., The precession of the Polar spacecraft orbit puts apogee (~9 Re) near the equator during 2000-2003 and allows correlative studies of electric fields and plasmas between Polar and the satellites of the Cluster constellation (apogee ~19 Re). This allows one to preview the sorts of radial and azimuthal alignments planned for the inner satellites of the THEMIS mission, and to better understand the relationships between the in-situ plasma and field measurements and the ground-based signatures of substorm onset. We have identified several dozen events spanning this interval where large-amplitude (&gt; 50 mV/m), temporally isolated, impulsive electric field fluctuations are identified on both Polar and Cluster. We compare the relative geomagnetic positions, timing, and amplitudes of each event as well as the relationship between those parameters and the ground-based (AE and magnetometer chain data) and orbital imaging signatures (IMAGE and Polar) of substorm onset., In the ""Alfvénic"" regime, i.e. for frequencies below the local proton cyclotron frequency, solar wind MHD turbulence exhibits what appears like an inertial domain, with power-law spectra and scale-invariance, suggesting as in fluid turbulence, a nonlinear energy cascade from the large ""energy containing"" scales towards the small scales where dissipation by kinetic effects is presumed to act. However, the intermittent character of solar wind fluctuations is much more important than in ordinary fluids. Indeed, the fluctuations consist of a mixture of random fluctuations and small-scale ""singular"" or coherent structures. This intermittency modifies significantly the scaling exponents of actual power-law spectra, which are directly related to the physical nature of the energy cascade taking place in the solar wind. The identification of the most intermittent structures and their relation to dissipation represents then a crucial problem in the framework of turbulence. We present here a new approach to study the scaling laws and intermittency based on the use of Wavelet transforms on simultaneous WIND 3s resolution particle and magnetic field data from the 3DP and the MFi experiments respectively. Using the Haar wavelet transform, spectra and structure functions are calculated. We show that this powerful technique allows: (1) for a systematic elimination of intermittency effects on spectra and structure functions and thus for a clear determination of the actual scaling properties in the inertial range, and (2) for a direct and systematic identification of the most active, singular structures responsible for the intermittency in the solar wind. We finally discuss the various effects which may be important for the formation of these structures in the absence of collisions., Measuring gamma rays via Compton scattering in a space environment is a challenging task: weak source signals have to be extracted from dominating background, which mainly originates from cosmic rays (prompt interactions as well as delayed decays) and earth albedo photons. <P />The approach of Advanced Compton Telescopes (ACT) to overcome this problem is to measure more parameters of the events (several Compton interactions, the recoil electron direction, etc.) with a higher accuracy than previous Compton telescopes like COMPTEL. <P />Still, this leaves the event reconstruction with three main tasks: Find the correct sequence of interactions, identify background and suppress incompletely absorbed events. <P />The most promising approach to accomplish those tasks is based on Bayesian statistics: The Compton interactions are parameterized in an eight-dimensional data space, which contains the interaction information of the Compton sequence. For each data space cell the probability that the corresponding interaction sequence is those of a correctly ordered, completely absorbed source photon can be determined by detailed simulations. <P />The result is an absolute quality factor for each event, based on which source events can be distinguished from background and incompletely absorbed photons. <P />We will report on the performance of the algorithm for a typical advanced Compton telescope design., The processes that led to the assembly of primitive inclusions in a once molten metal matrix as represented by IAB meteorites have not yet been fully understood [1]. Ar-Ar dating of the inclusions provides important information about the thermal history of the IAB parent body [e.g., 2, 3], but the analysis of bulk inclusions, the standard procedure in the past, is often impaired by excess 40Ar and redistribution or loss of K and/or Ar during the history of the meteoriod and in the reactor. To minimize these problems, we prepared from silicate inclusions of four IABs pure plagioclase separates of different grain sizes and quality grades. On these we performed high resolution stepwise Ar-40-Ar-39 dating. Preliminary ages for the different separates of the inclusions are, in Ma, 4540(11) to 4459(12) for Caddo County, 4500(20) to 4380(30) for Landes, 4440(50) to 4340(30) for Ocotillo, and 4480(40) to 4200(30) and 4430(30) to 4300(30) for CDC2 and CDC1, respectively. The age ranges might reflect the residence time of each inclusion in the K-Ar blocking temperature range (ca. 600 K), and is narrowest for Caddo County, being also the oldest inclusion studied by us. Assuming that IABs resulted from a collision of a molten metal body with a chondritic planetesimal [4], Caddo County could represent a surface sample explaining the early and fast cooling, whereas the other samples might have been buried deeper within the IAB body, subject to prolonged residence at elevated temperatures. If IABs formed in impact metal melt pools peppered with chondritic host material [5] the different cooling ages, and age ranges recorded in each inclusion could reflect residence times in a certain metal melt pool, which indirectly would translate into pool sizes and the energies released by the previous impacts. Also, there may have been more than one IAB parent body. Whatever process led to the formation of IAB meteorites was active already very early in the history of the solar system, in particular taking into account the possibility of a slightly excessive decay constant for K-40 [6]. Increasing the ages accordingly by 0.5 percent would shift Caddo County to about 4560 Ma, indistinguishable from the age of the solar system [7]. [1] Mittlefehldt et al.

Along with its high spectral resolution (1 keV) RHESSI is uniquely suited to study small events. Microflares have been observed by Benz &amp; Grigis (2002) and Krucker et al. (2002) to have anomalously steep spectra ( spectral index between -5 and -8) extending down to ∼ 7 keV. Thermal emission is found to dominate below ∼ 7 keV. In many other respects, microflares show properties similar to larger flares. We present single event studies of different types of x-ray microflares. RHESSI observations during quiet times (04-May 10-14; GOES level low B class) reveal a set 5 microflares (&gt;=A Class). These microflares show power law spectra (spectral index of ∼4-8) with little or no thermal emission in the 3- ∼7 keV energy range above the nonthermal part of the spectrum. Other microflares in the same GOES class range, however, have been found which show extremely hard spectra with emission up to 50 keV (power law index ∼2). At lower energies, emission is dominated by a hot thermal component (20 MK). This work was supported by NASA contract NAS5-98033., Detection of life on Mars requires definition of a suitable biomarker and development of sensitive yet compact instrumentation capable of performing in situ analyses. Our studies are focused on amino acid analysis because amino acids are more resistant to decomposition than other biomolecules, and because amino acid chirality is a well-defined biomarker. Amino acid composition and chirality analysis has been previously demonstrated in the lab on microfabricated capillary electrophoresis (CE) chips (1, 2). To analyze amino acids in situ, we have developed the Mars Organic Analyzer (MOA), a portable analysis system that consists of a compact instrument and a novel multi-layer CE microchip. The heart of the MOA is the microchip that contains the CE separation channels as well as microfabricated valves and pumps (3) for sample handling. The pneumatic microfabricated valves are created by combining an etched displacement chamber, an actuated PDMS membrane layer, and a discontinuous fluidic channel structure. A microfabricated pump is created by combining three individually-addressable valves in series. These membrane valves and pumps are integrated with the glass separation channel using a novel multilayer design in which sample enters the top fluidic layer for routing and is directed to the bottom glass layers for CE separation and analysis. The microfabricated device is operated by the portable instrument which contains solenoids for controlling fluidic valves, electronics, a 15 mW 400 nm diode laser, confocal detection optics, and a fiber-optic coupled photomultiplier for fluorescence detection. Limits of detection of fluorescamine-labeled amino acids are in the nM to pM range corresponding to part-per-trillion sensitivities in soil samples (4). The portable CE instrument, in combination with the Mars Organic Detector (MOD) (5), was recently successfully field tested on soil samples rich in jarosite from Panoche Valley, CA. Jarosite has recently been detected on Mars and is a key mineral indicating that liquid water was once present on the planet's surface. Amino acids from jarosite samples were sublimed by MOD and deposited onto a fluorescamine-coated cold finger. The microfabricated pumps were used to direct buffer through the MOA sipper to dissolve the sample, and then to return the sample for analysis. The jarosite sample was found to contain low levels of methyl and ethylamine (5 ppb), alanine/serine (0.4 ppb), glycine (0.2 ppb), glutamic (0.07 ppb) and aspartic (0.1 ppb) acid as well as a higher concentration of valine ( ∼100 ppb). These results clearly demonstrate that amines and amino acids can be extracted from sulfate-rich acidic soils such as jarosite and analyzed using the MOA (http://astrobiology.berkeley.edu).

(2000) Planetary &amp; Space Science 48, 1087-1091., A variety of geophysical evidence suggests that there may be a relatively thin zone of low viscosity at the base of the Earth's lithosphere, at least in oceanic and active continental regions. Numerical experiments on mantle convection and, more recently, on the self-consistent generation of plates show that the effects of a low viscosity zone (LVZ) are probably very important. An LVZ strongly increases the horizontal lengthscale of convection, and Earth's LVZ may be a key ingredient to the occurrence of plate tectonics. We have developed a simple boundary layer theory that yields considerable physical insight into these effects, and have tested the theory using 2-D numerical simulations. The theory successfully predicts how the preferred horizontal length scale of convection is controlled by the thickness and viscosity contrast of the LVZ (i.e., how Nusselt number varies with length scale.) Surprisingly, the degree of influence an LVZ exerts on the wavelength of convection actually increases with decreasing LVZ thickness, provided that the viscosity contrast is sufficiently strong according to a straightforward criterion that is also derived. An extended version of the theory further predicts that the effects of an LVZ are particularly pronounced if the LVZ is ""submerged"" beneath a strong lithosphere, a result initially discovered in 2-D numerical simulations and consistent with the apparently profound influence of an LVZ in promoting plate tectonics., During the October 22-25, 2003 interval strong solar activity resulted in several intervals of long duration strongly northward IMF. Using observations from Cluster, Geotail, DMSP, and FAST we investigate the state of the magnetosphere during these extreme solar wind conditions. We find that long duration strongly northward IMF results in global cooling (&lt;1 keV) and densification ( ∼1 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) of the entire plasmasheet, at all local times, and at all latitudes, including the neutral sheet. The transition to cold and dense plasma sheet occurs gradually over 3-4 hours following the northward turning of the IMF and the cold dense plasma starts to disappear when the IMF becomes B<SUB>y</SUB> dominated. During the cold dense plasma sheet intervals the FAST satellite observed inverse ion dispersion signatures in the cusp indicative of poleward-of-cusp reconnection, and nearly no polar cap. The observations show good quantitative agreement with global MHD simulations where the CDPS is formed by poleward-of-cusp reconnection capturing magnetosheath plasma which convects to the tail. The size of the lobes also shrank significantly in the simulation due to cusp reconnection., Using electron reflection magnetometry, we investigate the magnetic anomaly signatures of 20 Martian volcanoes. Most show magnetic lows characteristic of thermal demagnetization of crust in the presence of no significant global magnetic field. However, one of the oldest volcanoes, Hadriaca Patera, appears to be a magnetic source, suggesting thermoremanent magnetization following its last major period of magmatism. We investigate the likelihood that a global magnetic field was present at this time and find a distinct possibility that such a field was present. We compare the relative ages (according to the Hartmann &amp; Neukum cratering time-scale) and magnetic signatures of these 20 volcanoes and 7 giant impact basins and conclude that, ~300 Myr after the cessation of an early dynamo, a second dynamo episode may have started around ~3.85 Gyr ago and lasted for 100-350 Myr. We speculate that the second episode may have been due to one or more large mantle plumes that, in removing heat from the lower mantle, temporarily increased the core-mantle thermal gradient to restart the core dynamo. We discuss possible geophysical causes for such plumes and consider the implications of a second dynamo, and its associated magnetic shielding, for astrobiology., We describe a cosmological kinetic theory for the formation and relaxation of dark matter halos in hierarchical models of structure formation based on cold dark matter. This kinetic theory introduces a new way to calculate the evolution of the phase-space distribution of dark matter particles in galaxy halos, which traditionally have been investigated by numerical N-body methods. We find that Gaussian fluctuations in second-order cosmological perturbation theory lead to a Fokker-Planck equation, which is well known to describe the classical Brownian motion and globular clusters. We contrast the three systems and discuss possible extensions of this kinetic approach into the fully nonlinear regime of structure formation., Solar flare and magnetic storm activity occurring in October and November of 2003 have been the subjects of intense scrutiny for their extreme effects on the upper atmosphere and ionosphere. During these events, complimentary measurements of the upper atmosphere and ionosphere were made using a broad variety of space-based assets. Important to this initial study of the thermospheric disturbance are in-situ measurements of the neutral density near 400 km from the CHAMP and GRACE satellites. These carry sensitive accelerometers which can detect the slight satellite drag force from which the neutral density is then determined. Global images from the Far-Ultraviolet Spectrographic Imager onboard the NASA-IMAGE satellite provide a measure of the disturbance in thermospheric composition at lower altitudes (130-200 km). Observed from high altitudes, variations in atomic oxygen emissions at 135.6 nm closely follow the column integrated ratio of O/N<SUB>2</SUB>. In this initial comparison of the two data sets, the correspondence of total density at high altitudes and O/N<SUB>2</SUB> throughout the atmospheric column is examined and compared to expected results from empirical atmospheric models (cf. NRL-MSIS 2000). Departures from hydrostatic equilibrium should certainly be observed during the intense magnetic storm. The origin of any observed effects will be studied in the context of drivers including dynamical redistribution or impulsive auroral heating of the high-latitude thermosphere., Using MGS MAG/ER data and the technique of electron reflectometry, we present density measurements of Mars' nighttime upper atmosphere in the southern hemisphere between 1999 and 2004. For electron motion on open magnetic field lines connecting the solar wind to remanent crustal magnetization, reflection from magnetic gradients and absorption due to collisions with atmospheric neutrals results in a characteristic pitch angle-dependent attenuation in the electron flux, known as a loss cone. We develop a kinetic model of this interaction, assuming the validity of spherical harmonic expansions of the crustal field in regions of intense magnetization (such as Terra Sirenum), and assuming an adjustable, 2-species, isothermal atmosphere above 170km. Loss cones in the data are fitted to this model to constrain densities and temperatures in the upper atmosphere. Our range of sensitivity in altitude is based on the absorption probability of incident solar wind electrons and is ~170-260km. ~50,000 reliable measurements were made and binned by time and latitude. Major findings include 1) expected seasonal expansion/contraction of the upper atmosphere, 2) latitude dependence of densities and temperatures Showing southern winter polar warming, 3) observation of transition Altitude from CO2-dominance to O-dominance at ~200km. We present these findings and compare to the Mars Thermosphere Global Circulation Model (MTGCM) These measurements are important for improved understanding of the processes affecting Mars' upper atmosphere and of the orbital stability of future low-altitude spacecraft such as the 2005 Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter., The interpretation of Solar Energetic Particle or SEP events detected by STEREO will require a ""global"" picture that is consistent with the underlying solar wind context. One approach to such a model is under development by the CISM (Center for Integrated Space Weather Modeling) group. This model uses a guiding-center technique to follow ions in the &gt;10 MeV energy range in the magnetic fields produced by CISM heliospheric MHD simulations. The model accommodates a variety of source descriptions, including flare-related sources at the Sun and those from traveling interplanetary shocks described by the MHD models as a consequence of coronal transients propagating to 1 AU. The shock source descriptions will eventually be based on parameterizations derived from local ion-kinetic hybrid simulations of shocks covering the parameter space (Mach number, plasma beta, shock normal angles) of interest. The advantage of this approach is its relative generality in that it can accommodate any complicated coronal and solar wind field and source descriptions the MHD models (and observations) may require., The IMAGE satellite was the first dedicated to magnetospheric imaging, but has also provided numerous images of the nightside ionosphere with its Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) spectrographic imager. Nightside emissions of O I at 135.6-nm originating away from the aurora are due to recombination of ionospheric O<SUP>+</SUP>, and vary in intensity with (O<SUP>+</SUP>)<SUP>2</SUP>. IMAGE-FUV, operating in a highly elliptical orbit with apogee at middle latitudes and &gt;7 Re altitude, measures this emission globally with 100-km resolution. During each 14.5 hour orbit, IMAGE-FUV is able to monitor nightside ionospheric densities for up to 6-7 hours. Hundreds of low-latitude ionospheric bubbles, their development and drift speed, and a variety of other dynamical variations in brightness and morphology of the equatorial anomalies have been observed during this mission. Furthermore, the average global distribution of low-latitude ionospheric plasma densities can be determined in 3 days. Imaging data collected from February through June of 2002 are used to compile a dataset containing a variety of parameters (e.g., latitude and brightness of peak plasma density, zonal bubble drift speed) which can be drawn from for climatological studies. Recent results indicate that the average ground speed of low-latitude zonal plasma drifts vary with longitude by up to 50%, and that a periodic variation in ionospheric densities with longitude suggests the influence of a lower-thermospheric non-migrating tide with wave number = 4 on ionospheric densities. An excellent correlation between zonal drift speed and the magnetic storm index Dst is also found., The He+ ion provides a valuable tracer of solar wind dynamics and the heliospheric boundary. Mapping the heliosphere from 1 AU in 30.4nm with high spectral resolution will open access to the heliopause and reveal the three-dimensional flow of the solar wind. The scattered and emission fluxes are however faint, just a few milli-Rayleighs (mR), which poses a serious limitation on the mapping rate at high signal-to-noise ratio. We explore a spectrometer concept for narrowband EUV emission that offers important advantages over previous designs: high throughput (~1cps/mR), high spectral resolution (several thousand), no moving parts, and modest instrument size and mass. The concept combines a conventional normal-incidence Rowland mount grating and an efficient multilayer coating, with a microchannel plate detector performing two dimensional photon counting. One key innovation is the use of a large-area multi-slit at the spectrometer entrance. This multislit is a one dimensional sequence of open and opaque zones, against which pattern the accumulated spectral image can be correlated to recover the incident spectrum. The other innovation is arranging that each member of the multislit group is curved in such a way that the off-plane grating aberrations (which extend and rotate the image of each object point) do not introduce significant wavelength broadening. The curved slit arrangement yields a large well-corrected image field, and a high throughput for diffuse emission is achieved. This presentation concentrates on the design of the wide-field mount that maximizes the working area populated by the slits. The curved-multislit Rowland spectrometer will have a variety of other applications in astrophysics, aeronomy, and space physics sensing diffuse fluxes with high spectral resolution and sensitivity., The origin and heliospheric transport of SEP heavy ions are important areas for study due to both the hazards to humans and technologies these ions represent, as well as the information they contain about the processes of particle acceleration by the Sun. It has been suggested that compositional differences which depend on solar event longitude are associated with the particular geometry of the observer's connection to the CME-related shock. To learn more about this hypothesis, we analyze a number of significant heavy ion SEP events that occur in sequences of three as a CME-productive active region makes its way across the disk from east to center to west limb. For this purpose we use the SIS data from ACE, including ions above 5 MeV/n and masses up to and including Fe. We report on trends in the relative fluxes of heavy species that suggest altitude of connection rather than longitude of connection effects., We present initial results from SPEAR sky survey observations of a region near the North Ecliptic Pole. Because the SPEAR sky survey sweeps from the North Ecliptic Pole to the South Ecliptic Pole, this region receives a significantly higher total exposure than other parts of the sky. We present FUV spectra of this region and discuss the contributions to these spectra from hot interstellar gas, stellar radiation scattered by dust, unresolved stars, and molecular hydrogen fluorescence., Interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) contain enigmatic submicron components called GEMS (glass with embedded metal and sulfides). The compositions and structures of GEMS indicate that they have been processed by exposure to ionizing radiation, but details of the actual irradiation environment(s) have remained elusive. Here we propose a mechanism and astrophysical site for GEMS formation that explains for the first time the following key properties of GEMS: they are stoichiometrically enriched in oxygen and systematically depleted in S, Mg, Ca, and Fe (relative to solar abundances); most have normal (solar) oxygen isotopic compositions; they exhibit a strikingly narrow size distribution (0.1-0.5 μm diameter); and some of them contain ``relict'' crystals within their silicate glass matrices. We show that the compositions, size distribution, and survival of relict crystals are inconsistent with amorphization by particles accelerated by diffusive shock acceleration. Instead, we propose that GEMS are formed from crystalline grains that condense in stellar outflows from massive stars in OB associations, are accelerated in encounters with frequent supernova shocks inside the associated superbubble (SB), and are implanted with atoms from the hot gas in the SB interior. We thus reverse the usual roles of target and projectile. Rather than being bombarded at rest by energetic ions, grains are accelerated and bombarded by a nearly monovelocity beam of atoms as viewed in their rest frame. Meyer, Drury, and Ellison have proposed that Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) originate from ions sputtered from such accelerated dust grains. We suggest that GEMS are surviving members of a population of fast grains that constitute the long-sought source material for GCRs. Thus, representatives of the GCR source material may have been awaiting discovery in cosmic dust labs for the last 30 yr., To develop a suitable drill bit and set of operating conditions for Mars sample coring applications, it is essential to make tests under conditions that match those of the mission. The goal of the laboratory test program was to determine the drilling performance of diamond-impregnated bits under simulated Martian conditions, particularly those of low pressure and low temperature in a carbon dioxide atmosphere. For this purpose, drilling tests were performed in a vacuum chamber kept at a pressure of 5 torr. Prior to drilling, a rock, soil or a clay sample was cooled down to minus 80 degrees Celsius (Zacny et al, 2004). Thus, all Martian conditions, except the low gravity were simulated in the controlled environment. Input drilling parameters of interest included the weight on bit and rotational speed. These two independent variables were controlled from a PC station. The dependent variables included the bit reaction torque, the depth of the bit inside the drilled hole and the temperatures at various positions inside the drilled sample, in the center of the core as it was being cut and at the bit itself. These were acquired every second by a data acquisition system. Additional information such as the rate of penetration and the drill power were calculated after the test was completed. The weight of the rock and the bit prior to and after the test were measured to aid in evaluating the bit performance. In addition, the water saturation of the rock was measured prior to the test. Finally, the bit was viewed under the Scanning Electron Microscope and the Stereo Optical Microscope. The extent of the bit wear and its salient features were captured photographically. The results revealed that drilling or coring under Martian conditions in a water saturated rock is different in many respects from drilling on Earth. This is mainly because the Martian atmospheric pressure is in the vicinity of the pressure at the triple point of water. Thus ice, heated by contact with the rotating bit, sublimed and released water vapor. The volumetric expansion of ice turning into a vapor was over 150 000 times. This continuously generated volume of gas effectively cleared the freeze-dried rock cuttings from the bottom of the hole. In addition, the subliming ice provided a powerful cooling effect that kept the bit cold and preserved the core in its original state. Keeping the rock core below freezing also reduced drastically the chances of cross contamination. To keep the bit cool in near vacuum conditions where convective cooling is poor, some intermittent stops would have to be made. Under virtually the same drilling conditions, coring under Martian low temperature and pressure conditions consumed only half the power while doubling the rate of penetration as compared to drilling under Earth atmospheric conditions. However, the rate of bit wear was much higher under Martian conditions (Zacny and Cooper, 2004) References Zacny, K. A., M. C. Quayle, and G. A.

Acknowledgments The research supported by the NASA Astrobiology, Science and Technology Instrument Development (ASTID) program., Helium, the second-most abundant element in the universe and giant planets, is expected to metallize at much higher pressures and temperatures than the most abundant element, hydrogen. The difference in chemical-bonding character, between insulator and metal, is expected to make hydrogen-helium mixtures immiscible throughout large fractions of planetary interiors, and therefore subject to gravitational separation contributing significantly to the internal dynamics of giant planets. Using laser-driven shock waves on samples pre-compressed in high-pressure cells, we have obtained the first measurements of optical reflectivity from the shock front in helium to pressures of 146 GPa. The reflectivity exceeds 5% above \ensuremath{\sim} 100 GPa, indicating high electrical conductivity. By varying the initial pressure (hence density) of the sample, we can access a much wider range of final pressure-temperature conditions than is possible in conventional Hugoniot experiments. Our work increases by nine-fold the pressure range of single-shock measurements, in comparison with gas-gun experiments, and yields results in agreement with the Saumon, Chabrier and Van Horn (1994) equation of state for helium. This changes the internal structures inferred for Jupiter-size planets, relative to models based on earlier equations of state (e. g., SESAME)., Soils lie at the interface of the atmosphere and lithosphere, and the rates of chemical and physical processes that form them hinge on the availability of water. Here we quantify the effect of these processes on soil volume and mass in different rainfall regimes. We then use the results of this synthesis to compare with the growing chemical dataset for soils on Mars in order to identify moisture regimes on Earth that may provide crude analogues for past Martian weathering conditions. In this synthesis, the rates of elemental gains/losses, and corresponding volumetric changes, were compared for soils in nine soil chronosequences (sequences of soils of differing ages) - sequences formed in climates ranging from ~1 to ~4500 mm mean annual precipitation (MAP). Total elemental chemistry of soils and parent materials were determined via XRF, ICP-MS, and/or ICP-OES, and the absolute elemental gains or losses (and volume changes) were determined by normalizing data to an immobile index element. For the chronosequences examined, the initial stages of soil formation (10<SUP>3</SUP>^ to 10<SUP>4</SUP>^ yr), regardless of climate, generally show volumetric expansion due to (1) reduction in bulk density by biological/physical turbation, (2) addition of organic matter, (3) accumulation of water during clay mineral synthesis, and/or (4) accumulation of atmospheric salts and dust. Despite large differences in parent materials (basalt, sandstone, granitic alluvium), there was a systematic relationship between long-term (10<SUP>5</SUP>^ to 10<SUP>6</SUP>^ yr) volumetric change and rainfall, with an approximate cross-over point between net expansion (and accumulation of atmospheric solutes and dust) and net collapse (net losses of Si, Al, and alkaline earths and alkali metals) between approximately 20 and 100 mm MAP. Recently published geochemical data of soils at Gusev Crater (Gellert et al. 2004. Science 305:829), when normalized to Ti, show apparent net losses of Si and Al that range between 5 and 50% of values relative to adjacent rocks. However the chemical impact of globally distributed dust on Mars greatly affects the interpretation of these apparent elemental losses. From the available soil data, no Earth-based soil geochemical signature perfectly matches the reported Martian data, though arid soils in the Atacama Desert and elsewhere exhibit certain similarities (losses of Si, Al and gains of S). For both Earth and Mars, an understanding of the chemical signature of atmospherically derived elements is critical for calculating accurate measures of chemical weathering in soils., We agree with George et al. that high <SUP>226</SUP>Ra/ <SUP>230</SUP>Th and correlated Ba/Th, <SUP>238</SUP>U/ <SUP>230</SUP>Th, and other elemental and isotopic ratios are the result of fluid addition to the wedge. The Feineman and DePaolo [Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 215 (2003) 339-355] manuscript addresses more specifically the pathway followed by the fluid en route to the surface. In particular, we address whether the <SUP>226</SUP>Ra/ <SUP>230</SUP>Th data directly yield the total time available for the fluid to migrate from the point of origin in the slab to the melting region in the wedge, and ultimately to the surface with the melt. All of the processes involved in generating arc volcanism would of necessity have to take place very rapidly within the constraints proposed by George et al. The alternative is that the upward fluid movement is hindered by the fluid flow regime and solid mantle flow, allowing more time for reaction with the mantle wedge. There is evidence in the U-series data for more than one time scale, and our model helps to explain how this could come about. The extent to which grainscale <SUP>226</SUP>Ra/ <SUP>230</SUP>Th disequilibrium affects the inferred melt transport time is yet another issue, and this could be achieved either with the small-degree melt mechanism we discussed or by additional effects associated with melt and fluid migration at later stages in the melt generation process. We agree that the final melt transport event is likely to happen quickly. One of the most puzzling features of volcanic arcs is that the volcanic front emerges considerably behind the presumed location of primary water release from the subducting slab (depth to slab is ∼120 km beneath the volcanic front, as opposed to the predicted ∼80 km). This offset between the expected site of fluid release and the location of the volcanic front can be attributed to coupled transport of the fluid—in the form of hydrous minerals, such as amphibole and/or phlogopite in the wedge [J. Geophys. Res. 97 (1992) 2037-2070] or redirection of the melt due to flow and stresses in the mantle matrix as the magma slowly percolates upward [J. Geol. 95 (1987) 285-307]. In either case, the fluid and/or melt is required to ascend slowly, at least for some part of its journey, to explain the location of the volcanic front. Furthermore, <SUP>238</SUP>U/ <SUP>230</SUP>Th disequilibria in arc lavas seem to suggest a relatively long interval for fluid addition (∼30-60 ka) [Science 292 (2001) 1363-1366; Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 179 (2000) 581-593; Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 61 (1997) 4855-4884], which is difficult to reconcile with the <SUP>226</SUP>Ra/ <SUP>230</SUP>Th disequilibrium observed in the lavas. For these reasons, we sought to find a means whereby apparently short-lived isotopic disequilibria could be maintained during complex fluid and melt migration in the mantle wedge. Below, we address a few of the main issues presented by George et al. [Earth. Planet. Sci. Lett. this issue] in their comment., We use RHESSI to investigate coronal sources in six behind-the-limb flares with occulted or partially occulted footpoints. The major findings are as follows: (1) Coronal hard X-ray (&gt; 20 keV) emission is observed above thermal soft X-ray (&lt; 12 keV) and EUV (195 Å) emission (which confirms Masuda's above-the-loop-top source); (2) Coronal HXR sources show impulsive (on a scale of tens of seconds) variation in their HXR time profiles; (3) The data can be fitted with a power law component with an index of 5 to 7 or with several thermal components with very high temperatures up to 100 MK. Presently, using the derived physical parameters, we test various heating models to determine whether the coronal HXR emission is thermal or non-thermal., Strong interplanetary shocks accelerate solar wind electrons to produce a foreshock region and, often, type II radio bursts. On upstream field lines, these electrons can be dispersed due to time-of-flight effects. We use data from instruments on the Wind spacecraft to study this effect at several strong IP shocks. At each shock, a velocity-dispersed electron beam is detected in the upstream region. We use the dispersion to calculate field line length to the shock source. The measurement of field line length indicates the existence and scale of structure on the shock front., The solar wind is a collisionless, strongly turbulent plasma in a supersonic and super-Alfvénic spherical expansion. One of its most striking features is the very large number of degrees of freedom that are excited: the electromagnetic fields and plasma properties of the solar wind show fluctuations over a very wide range of time scales, ranging from the solar rotation period down to the local electron plasma period, i.e. for frequencies f from 10<SUP>-6</SUP> Hz up to f<SUB>pe</SUB> ∼ 2ṡ 10<SUP>4</SUP> Hz. We present and discuss here a global spectrum (2 months average) of solar wind electromagnetic fluctuations over the above-mentioned frequency range, obtained using data from several instruments on the WIND spacecraft at 1 AU near L1. The observed power spectrum shows a power-law f<SUP>-5/3</SUP> in the Alvénic frequency range, between 10<SUP>-4</SUP> to 0.4 Hz, but it steepens to roughly f<SUP>-3</SUP> up to the local electron cyclotron frequency ( f<SUB>ce</SUB> ∼ 100 - 200 Hz). It is now widely recognized that the f<SUP>-5/3</SUP> spectrum is the ""inertial range"" of MHD turbulence in the solar wind, resulting from a nonlinear energy cascade operating from the large ""energy containing"" scales to smaller scales where dissipation is presumed to act. The aim of this paper is to address both questions of turbulence and dissipation in the solar wind at 1 AU. For that, I will present new results of recent investigations using WIND data at 1 AU near L1, covering both the inertial and the f<SUP>-3</SUP> ranges. In a first part, results on the scaling properties and intermittent character of solar wind fluctuations in the inertial range will be discussed. The spectral steepening around 0.4 Hz is commonly believed to be due to collisionless ion-cyclotron damping of Alfvénic-like fluctuations present in the inertial range. But, is damping really the dominant effect or is the f<SUP>-3</SUP> power-law from 0.4 Hz to f<SUB>ce</SUB> sustained by some other kinetic effects that would overcome damping, as pointed out by some recent theoretical interpretations? To address this question, in a second part, i will discuss the nature of the fluctuations in this range, their properties, their possible source(s) and their role in the control of the energy transport in the solar wind., Previous observations by Lunar Prospector (LP) revealed the presence of monoenergetic field-aligned upward-going electron beams of moderate energies (&lt;100 eV) coming from the lunar night side, both in the solar wind wake and in the magnetotail. Simultaneous observations of energy-dependent loss cones established that these beams likely consisted of secondary electrons accelerated from the lunar surface by an electrostatic potential. Due to the moderate potentials implied and the rather large Debye lengths (and therefore electric field scale heights) of ∼100-1000 m in these low-density regions, these potentials were not considered hazardous. A recent re-examination of LP data, however, has shown that, in more energetic plasma environments like the magnetotail plasmasheet, upward-going electron beams sometimes reach energies as high as 1-2 keV. These more energetic beams are commonly seen above the lunar night side and (though less frequently) sometimes even forward of the terminator, implying that plasmasheet currents are sometimes high enough to charge the surface negative despite photoemission. Higher plasma densities in the plasmasheet mean Debye lengths and therefore scale heights as small as ∼1-20 m, which along with the large potentials implied, could lead to electric fields as high as ∼100-1000 V/m. These fields are large enough to present a serious hazard to astronauts and equipment on the lunar surface. Though we are unfortunately limited by the low time and therefore spatial resolution of the LP measurements, I present here a first-cut characterization of the global distribution of large negative lunar surface potentials., I explore the scaling of shock strength, cross-shock and convection electric field with heliospheric radius in the inner heliosphere. In the low β <SUB>e</SUB> inner heliosphere, the primary contribution to the cross-shock field may be due to Hall currents, which are shown to scale non-monotonically with Mach number and exhibit a local minimum near the Alfvèn speed peak at several solar radii. This allows that the shock and cross-shock component of the convection fields are nearly equal |ěc{E}<SUB>shock</SUB>| ≈ (ěc{v} × ěc{B})<SUB>x</SUB>, which is a condition for high efficiency of the shock-surfing mechanism of ion acceleration. Shock-surfing is thought to be a injection mechanism to diffusive acceleration and, indeed, observations show that energetic ion events are often accelerated at near this same heliospheric radius., Differential rotation can be detected in Doppler broadening profiles of moderately rapid rotators. Accurate broadening functions have been derived in more than 700 rapidly rotating stars of spectral types A8--G5 using a least-squares deconvolution technique. Incorporating as many as 300 absorption lines, the accuracy of the resulting profile permits analysis of the rotation law in more than 350 stars which are apparently not contaminated by spots. Significant signatures of strong solar-like differential rotation, i.e., the equator rotating more than 10% faster than the poles, have been detected in about twenty stars of various temperatures and rotational velocities. I show that stars rotating as rapidly as v sin {i} = 100 km/s show signatures of differential rotation, and discuss how the fraction of strongly differentially rotating stars depends on rotation and temperature. <P />I acknowledge research funding from the European Commission's Sixth Framework Programme as an Outgoing International Fellow., The Lupus Loop is known as old supernova remnant, and has been observed in radio and X-ray wavelength range. We present far-ultraviolet images and spectra of the Lupus Loop region observed with FIMS (Far-ultraviolet IMaging Spectrograph; also known as SPEAR) which is a main payload onboard the first Korean scientific satellite, STSAT-1. The FIMS has an unprecedented wide field-of-view, and thus is suitable to the study of global features in diffuse interstellar medium. The spatial intensity distribution in L-band(1330-1720Å) showed a close correlation with the maps which had been observed in other wavelength range, such as hydrogen 21cm emission map, ROSAT 0.25 keV soft x-ray map, and SFD dust map. We also divided the Lupus Loop region into several regions, and investigated their spectral characteristics; C IV, Si II, and O VI emission lines were detected in some sub-regions although the signal intensities were rather week. <P />This work was supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF), Electric fields with amplitudes to 150 mV/m and average durations of 7.5 milliseconds have been observed frequently at the magnetospheric side of the dayside magnetopause and in the near-earth tail. These fields are predominantly perpendicular to B, they are electrostatic, and they occur inside local minima in the plasma density. Some aspects of their occurrence and statistics are described., The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) has detected nuclear gamma-ray line emission from several large solar flares, including four of the X-class solar flares of October-November 2003. Collisions of accelerated ions with the ambient solar medium produce nuclear de-excitation lines, and these lines are spectrally resolved by RHESSI. The fluxes and shapes of these lines depend on the acceleration spectrum and the composition of the accelerated and ambient populations. Several of these flares exhibit changes in the relative fluxes over time, which in some of the flares is consistent with variations of the ambient abundances according to first-ionization potentials (FIP). Also, since these lines are produced by both accelerated protons and accelerated alpha particles, a detailed study of the line shapes constrains the alpha/proton ratio in these flares. We present the latest results from RHESSI on line-ratio variability and constraints on the alpha/proton ratio., Aerogel collectors have been deployed in low-Earth orbit to collect orbital debris and micrometeorites. An array of silica aerogel collectors is currently en-route back to Earth following an encounter with the Comet Wild-2 on board the Stardust spacecraft. Stardust is returning, for laboratory analysis, cometary and interstellar dust grains which impacted into the aerogel collectors at hypervelocities. While the morphology of impact craters in aerogels has been studied empirically, a theoretical understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for the formation of impact craters in these solids is lacking. Here we propose and test a model of compaction driven impact cratering in aerogels. Our model derives impact crater dimensions directly from energy and momentum deposition., We review the recent proposal that neutrinos are light because their masses are proportional to a low scale, f, of lepton flavor symmetry breaking. This mechanism is testable because the resulting pseudo-Goldstone bosons, of mass m<SUB>G</SUB>, couple strongly with the neutrinos, affecting the acoustic oscillations during the eV era of the early universe that generate the peaks in the CMB radiation. Characteristic signals result over a very wide range of (f, m<SUB>G</SUB>) because of a change in the total relativistic energy density and because the neutrinos scatter rather than free-stream. Thermodynamics allows a precise calculation of the signal, so that observations would not only confirm the late-time neutrino mass mechanism, but could also determine whether the neutrino spectrum is degenerate, inverted or hierarchical and whether the neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana. The flavor symmetries could also give light sterile states. If the masses of the sterile neutrinos turn on after the MeV era, the LSND oscillations can be explained without upsetting big bang nucleosynthesis, and, since the sterile states decay to lighter neutrinos and pseudo-Goldstones, without giving too much hot dark matter., In contrast to the liquid outer core, the earth's inner core is mostly solid, and its composition is more pure iron. Based on dynamic arguments related to the freezing process of the inner core, and the observation of much lower P-wave quality factor in the inner core ( Q<SUB>α</SUB>&lt;450) than in the outer core ( Q<SUB>α</SUB>&gt;10,000), it has been suggested that a mushy layer with liquid inclusions may exist at the top of the inner core. On the other hand, seismic measurements indicate that Q<SUB>α</SUB> increases towards the center of the inner core. We here present estimates of Q<SUB>α</SUB> in the depth range 32-110 km beneath the Inner Core Boundary (ICB), based on the measurement of PKIKP/PKiKP amplitude ratios after a narrow band-pass filtering (0.7-2.0 Hz). Our measurements indicate that there are pronounced hemispherical differences in the values of Q<SUB>α</SUB> (∼335 and ∼160 in the western (180°W to 40°E) and eastern (40°E to 180°E) hemispheres, respectively), and in the depth of transition from decreasing to increasing Q<SUB>α</SUB> (&lt;32 km beneath the ICB in the eastern hemisphere and ∼85 km in the western hemisphere). Below 85 km, the hemispherical pattern disappears. We also confirm the existence of a correlated hemispherical pattern in P velocity down to 85 km. The P velocity and Q<SUB>α</SUB> variations are compatible with an interpretation in terms of small hemispherical variations of temperature at the top of the inner core and their influence on the morphology of porosity and connectivity of liquid inclusions in the mushy zone. The disappearance of the differences in Q<SUB>α</SUB> beneath 85 km provide constraints on the likely depth extent of the mushy zone., The transition from Population III (Pop III) to Population II (Pop II) stars is determined by the presence of a sufficient amount of metals, in particular, oxygen and carbon. The vastly different yields of these relevant metals between different initial stellar mass functions would then cause such a transition to occur at different times. We show that the transition from Pop III to Pop II stars is likely to occur before the universe can be reionized, if the initial mass function (IMF) is entirely very massive stars (M&gt;=140 M<SUB>solar</SUB>). A factor of about 10 more ionizing photons would be produced in the case with a normal top-heavy IMF (e.g., M~10-100 M<SUB>solar</SUB>), when such a transition occurs. Thus, a high Thomson optical depth (τ<SUB>e</SUB>&gt;=0.11-0.14) may be an indication that the Pop III stars possess a more conventional top-heavy IMF., We present Keck Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer optical spectra of 17 Lyα-emitting galaxies and one Lyman break galaxy at z~4.5 discovered in the Large Area Lyman Alpha survey. The survey has identified a sample of ~350 candidate Lyα-emitting galaxies at z~4.5 in a search volume of 1.5×10<SUP>6</SUP> comoving Mpc<SUP>3</SUP>. We targeted 25 candidates for spectroscopy; hence, the 18 confirmations presented herein suggest a selection reliability of 72%. The large equivalent widths (median W<SUP>rest</SUP><SUB>λ</SUB>~80 Å) but narrow physical widths (Δv&lt;500 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) of the Lyα emission lines, along with the lack of accompanying high-ionization state emission lines, suggest that these galaxies are young systems powered by star formation rather than by active galactic nucleus activity. Theoretical models of galaxy formation in the primordial universe suggest that a small fraction of Lyα-emitting galaxies at z~4.5 may still be nascent, metal-free objects. Indeed, we find with 90% confidence that three to five of the confirmed sources show W<SUP>rest</SUP><SUB>λ</SUB>&gt;240 Å, exceeding the maximum Lyα equivalent width predicted for normal stellar populations. Nonetheless, we find no evidence for He II λ1640 emission in either individual or composite spectra, indicating that although these galaxies are young, they are not truly primitive, Population III objects. <P />Based in part on observations made at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation., We present new measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect from clusters of galaxies using the second-generation Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Infrared Experiment (SuZIE II). We combine these new measurements with previous cluster observations with the SuZIE instrument to form a sample of 15 clusters of galaxies. For this sample we calculate the central Comptonization y<SUB>0</SUB> and the integrated SZ flux decrement S for each of our clusters. We find that the integrated SZ flux is a more robust observable derived from our measurements than the central Comptonization because of inadequacies in the spatial modeling of the intracluster gas with a standard β-model. This is highlighted by comparing our central Comptonization results with values calculated from measurements using the BIMA and OVRO interferometers. On average, the SuZIE-calculated central Comptonizations are ~60% higher in the cooling flow clusters than the interferometric values, compared to only ~12% higher in the non-cooling flow clusters. We believe this discrepancy to be in large part due to the spatial modeling of the intracluster gas. From our cluster sample we construct y<SUB>0</SUB>-T and S-T scaling relations. The y<SUB>0</SUB>-T scaling relation is inconsistent with what we would expect for self-similar clusters; however, this result is questionable because of the large systematic uncertainty in y<SUB>0</SUB>. The S-T scaling relation has a slope and redshift evolution consistent with what we expect for self-similar clusters, with a characteristic density that scales with the mean density of the universe. We rule out zero-redshift evolution of the S-T relation at ~90% confidence., Improvements in paleontology and geochronology have made it clear that the changes in biodiversity during the Phanerozoic (0-542 Ma) are not simply random but also contain strikingly periodic features. The most prominent and compelling of these is a 62 +/- 3 Myr cycle whose declines incorporate many of the mass extinctions in Earth's history. A second, statistically ambiguous cycle with a period of 140 +/- 15 Myr also occurs. Such periodicities almost certainly indicate that an as yet unknown cyclic physical process has been having a significant influence on the Earth's environment. Having searched records of sea level, climate, glaciation, isotopic shifts, volcanism, and other environmental changes, we have found no strong evidence of a matching 62 Myr cycle, though some similarities between the changes in diversity and episodes of volcanism and/or sea level change cannot be entirely ignored. By contrast, the 140 Myr cycle matches changes at the same frequency previously reported in climate, glaciation, and cosmic ray flux. The causes of these cycles are unknown though one can speculate on the kinds of astrophysical or geophysical processes that might be capable of maintaining periodic behavior on such long time scales. The leading candidates appear to be encounters with large scale galactic structure (e.g. spiral arms) and periodic pulses of plume formation from the core-mantle boundary. Encounters with spiral arms have previously been invoked to explain the 140 Myr changes in climate but the timing of such encounters is still very uncertain. In simulations and experimental models, plume formation can exhibit periodic modes and could thus lead to periodic episodes of major volcanism of the form frequently implicated in extinctions, though as yet no compelling evidence of periodic volcanism exists. Other scenarios, such as oscillations about the galactic plane or the presence of a solar companion star, are considered, but they are regarded as less likely. However, regardless of the mechanisms, the substantial changes in the biosphere accomplished by the 62 Myr cycle must have left environmental clues that will ultimately lead us to determining its origin., Although the dominant loss processes for ring current ions are collisional, wave-particle interactions are also believed to play an important role as they provide a mechanism for the rapid decay of the ring current during the early recovery phase of geomagnetic storms. Considerable attention has been given to regions of spatial overlap between energetic, anisotropic ring current ions and cold, dense plasmaspheric material that should be particularly conducive to the growth of electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves. Resonant interaction between ring current ions and EMIC waves results in pitch angle scattering and subsequent precipitation of the energetic ions into the upper atmosphere. Global imaging of the proton aurora by the Far Ultraviolet (FUV) Spectrographic Imager (SI) on-board the IMAGE satellite has led to the identification of arcs of precipitating protons at latitudes equatorward of and separated from the main proton auroral oval in the afternoon local time sector. We investigate the occurrence of these arcs and their relationship with the plasmasphere and electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves. In a four month study interval including sixteen events, we find that the detached proton arcs are more likely to occur during geomagnetically disturbed periods and specifically at times when enhanced energetic ion densities and temperature anisotropies are observed in the equatorial magnetosphere. The disturbance-time arcs tend to be located at lower magnetic latitudes and are consistently associated with plasmaspheric plumes as observed by the IMAGE Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) instrument. Wave data from the POLAR Magnetic Field Experiment (MFE) available for two of the detached arc events indicate the presence of strong EMIC waves near the equator in the vicinity of the proton precipitation region., During April and May of 2004, the Ultraviolet Imager (UVI) onboard the Polar spacecraft was in the unique position to observe two comets near their perihelion: C/2001 Q4 (NEAT) and C/2002 T7 (LINEAR). Using its suite of four far ultraviolet filters, UVI is able to observe atomic oxygen emissions at 130.4 nm and atomic carbon emissions at 156.1 nm and 165.7 nm. The photon flux is directly related to the production rates for these atoms. From the oxygen and carbon production rates, we are able to estimate the production rates of CO, OH, and water. Initial analysis shows that both comets are very dim in the far ultraviolet and are not easily detected by UVI. We are able to derive upper limits to the production rates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of observations of these comets in the far ultraviolet region., The CISM (Center for Integrated Space Weather Modeling) inner heliospheric model CORHEL is extended to 10 AU to investigate how well this solar magnetogram-based 3D MHD model describes the solar wind influence on Saturn's magnetosphere. The CORHEL model describes the steady solar wind stream structure and its origins in the corona. It has been tuned to provide a simulation of the solar wind parameters at 1 AU including plasma moments and interplanetary magnetic field magnitude and polarity in the absence of disturbances from coronal transients. Comparisons with the Cassini CAPS plasma and magnetometer field observations during Cassini's approach to Saturn show good agreement with the model, in part because of a low solar activity and a particularly simple and steady interplanetary sector pattern during the months before the Saturn orbit insertion (SOI). It is known that Saturn's magnetosphere responds to solar wind dynamic pressure enhancements, which are evident in this period with striking regularity. The model agreement suggests that a viable option is available both to predict such enhancements from co-rotating stream interaction regions, as well as to provide an approximation to solar wind conditions when Cassini is inside Saturn's magnetosphere. Moreover, as radial alignment with other close-in spacecraft is not required, this study illustrates the potential use of state-of-the-art numerical models to study space weather on a solar-system-wide scale., Significant advances in high pressure-temperature experiments now make it possible to measure the viscosity of fluids at deep-planetary conditions. This is important because viscosity is often the rate-limiting factor for internal planetary dynamics, yet it is poorly understood from a theoretical perspective. New rolling-sphere measurements on methanol and a 4:1 methanol:ethanol mixture, using a resistance-heated diamond-cell, yield an activation energy and volume of 18 to 99 (± 5) kJ/mol and 4.5 to 3.2 (± 0.4) cm<SUP>3</SUP>/mol over the pressure-temperature range of 0 to 6.5 GPa and 298 to 338 K. These alcohols are potential analogs for structured liquids, such as the silicate melts of the Earth's interior, and are also important as pressure transmitting media in diamond-cell experiments. Our data are in good agreement with previous measurements at room temperature, and we find that both activated-state (Arrhenius) and free-volume models fit the data within our uncertainties. Extrapolation based on these models yields glass-transition pressures (10<SUP>12</SUP> Pa s) of 19.7 (± 0.5) GPa and 11.0 (± 0.8) GPa at room temperature. Note that our measurements extend beyond the equilibrium crystallization pressure of methanol, 3.6 GPa at 300 K, so provide information about viscous relaxation of the metastable liquid state., , With 5 g of soil collected by the Apollo 12 astronauts, we are continuing our study of the meteoroid bombardment history of the Moon and the inner solar system. The Moon, by virtue of its lack of water and air, preserves evidence of ancient meteoroid impacts that would quickly be eroded away or otherwise obscured on Earth. We use the <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>39</SUP>Ar isochron technique to determine the ages of individual glass spherules which are produced in meteoroid impacts on the Moon. The spherules in our study are ∼200 microns in diameter, and typically contain ∼100 fmol of radiogenic <SUP>40</SUP>Ar. In Culler et al. (Science 287, p. 1785, 2000), we reported the ages of spherules from an Apollo 14 soil sample. The distribution of spherule ages from a well-mixed sample of the lunar regolith is a proxy for the impactor flux to the Moon since the end of mare basalt volcanism, over 3 billion years ago. The surprising abundance of spherules with young ages that we found in the Apollo 14 soil suggests that the meteoroid bombardment rate in the inner solar system increased suddenly, by a factor of approximately 4, about 400 million years ago. We are testing this hypothesis by examining spherules from a second lunar location; our Apollo 12 samples were collected 180 km away from the Apollo 14 spherules studied by Culler et al. (2000). We have so far analyzed over 100 spherules from Apollo 12 sample 12023. Geochemical analyses of each spherule indicate that the vast majority were formed in impacts, rather than in volcanic eruptions. Preliminary indications are that we are confirming an overabundance of spherules with ages younger than 400 million years. We will present final, calibrated geochronological results for over 150 spherules at the conference. Observing an apparent increase in spherule production at two widely spaced locations on the Moon favors the hypothesis of increased meteoroid bombardment, and disfavors the possibility that special geological circumstances at particular lunar locations led to an increase in spherule production or preservation 400 million years ago. Understanding this meteoroid flux increase will be an interesting future direction in planetary science., We present near-infrared (1.24-2.26 μm) images of Saturn's E and G rings which were taken with the W.M. Keck telescope in 1995 August 9-11, during the period that Earth crossed Saturn's ring plane. Our data confirm that the E ring is very blue. Its radial and vertical structure are found to be remarkably similar to that apparent in the HST ringplane crossing data at visible wavelengths, reinforcing models of the ring's peculiar narrow or very steep particle size distribution. Our data show unambiguously that the satellite Tethys is a secondary source of material for the E ring. The G ring is found to be distinctly red, similar in color to Jupiter's main ring, indicative of a (more typical) broad particle size distribution., Making an impact on pre-service teacher preparation is challenging and requires a multi-faceted approach. To begin with, it's advisable to be informed by the education research and consensus policy statements published by the teacher education community, and to make meaningful connections with educators in this field. Two significant books to consult in this area come from the National Academy Press: ""How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience, and School"" (NRC, 2000; see in particular chapter 8 on 'Teacher Learning') and ""Educating Teachers of Science, Mathematics, and Technology: New Practices for the New Millennium"" (NRC, 2001). Much can also be learned from joining the Association for the Education Teachers of Science (AETS; www.TheAETS.org) and/or attending its annual conferences, which attract various science teacher educators. <P />It goes without saying that most teachers tend to teach science the way they learned it themselves, at least as a ""default"" pedagogical approach. Thus, initiatives in pre-service teacher preparation should include efforts to involve constructivist, inquiry-based teaching and learning in the undergraduate science lecture and laboratory courses that future teachers are enrolling in. <P />Another important area in teacher education is the ""science methods"" course that a pre-service teacher enrolls in, through a college or school of education. Science methods courses are usually offered in both elementary and secondary education, and the approaches in each are of course different. Pre-service teachers in methods courses are often most concerned with classroom management strategies, and there is usually not much time in these courses for guidance on astronomy-specific (or any discipline-specific) curriculum and instruction. <P />But experiences with short ""interventions"" in both elementary and secondary science methods courses have demonstrated that talking about and working hands-on with a well-designed space science curriculum resource (e.g. ""The Real Reasons for Seasons"" GEMS guide) can work well and influence the novice teacher's learning., NASA has recently formed a Science and Technology Definition Team (STDT) to define the Sentinels mission, the heliospheric element of the integrated LWS program. The objective of the Sentinels is to discover, understand and model the connection between solar events such as flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and heliospheric and magnetospheric events, such as Solar Particle Events (SPEs), that can adversely impact life and society. Moreover, Sentinels is also relevant for the new NASA exploration initiative to the Moon and beyond. The primary objective of Sentinels is to provide the observations necessary for an understanding of the physics of the Sun/inner heliosphere processes that affect the solar system, so the requirements for eventual predictive capability can be defined. I will describe the preliminary scientific planning to implement the Sentinels mission., More than 600 elliptical aerobraking and science phasing orbits made by Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) early in the mission provide unprecedented coverage of the solar wind in the vicinity of the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos, as well as their orbits. We have performed a comprehensive survey of electron and magnetic field perturbations in the solar wind to search for possible signatures of solar wind interaction with dust or gas escaping from the moons. Contrary to previous reports based on PHOBOS-2 spacecraft data we find that the solar wind perturbations are distributed quite equally over the spatial area covered by MGS and there are no clustering of perturbations near Phobos, Deimos, their orbits, or their wakes. The solar wind perturbations are most likely caused by the multiple bow shock crossings, foreshock turbulence, and hot flow anomalies. We conclude that the density of the gas/dust escaping the moons must be too low to induce detectable electron and magnetic field perturbations in the solar wind. In essence we do not find any evidence for outgassing/dust escape from the Martian moons., , The Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) will make precise astrometric measurements that can be used to detect planets around nearby stars. Since observational time will be extremely valuable, it is important to consider how the choice of the observing schedule influences the efficiency of SIM planet searches. We have conducted Monte Carlo simulations of astrometric observations to understand the effects of different scheduling algorithms. We find that the efficiency of planet searches is relatively insensitive to the observing schedule for most reasonable observing schedules., Over the first 2.5 years of operation, the FUV instrument on the IMAGE spacecraft observed more than 2400 substorm onsets in the Northern Hemisphere. The observations confirm earlier results of statistical studies in terms of a median substorm onset location at 2300 hours MLT and 66.4 degrees magnetic latitude. The list is published as an electronic supplement to a publication in the Journal of Geophysical Research [Frey et al., 2004]. The list can easily be searched for onsets close to certain ground stations or at specific magnetic latitudes or local times. As one example of such use we demonstrate how the probability of onset observation was determined for the ground-based automatic observatories of the THEMIS (Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms) project., We present the first measurement of weak lensing by large-scale structure on scales of 1°-4° based on radio observations. We utilize the FIRST radio survey, a quarter-sky, 20 cm survey produced with the NRAO Very Large Array (VLA). The large angular scales afforded by the FIRST survey provide a measurement in the linear regime of the matter power spectrum, thus avoiding the necessity of applying uncertain nonlinear corrections. Moreover, since the VLA interferometer has a well-known and deterministic beam, our measurement does not suffer from the irreproducible effects of atmospheric seeing that limit ground-based optical surveys. We use the shapelet method described in an earlier paper to estimate the shear from the shape of radio sources derived directly from the interferometric measurements in the Fourier (u,v)-plane. With realistic simulations we verify that the method yields unbiased shear estimators. We study and quantify the systematic effects that can produce spurious shears, analytically and with simulations, and carefully correct for them. We measure the shear correlation functions on angular scales of 0.5d-40° and compute the corresponding aperture mass statistics. On 1°-4° scales, we find that the B-modes are consistent with zero and detect a lensing E-mode signal significant at the 3.0 σ level. After removing nearby radio sources with an optical counterpart, the E-mode signal increases by 10%-20%, as expected for a lensing signal derived from more distant sources. We use the E-mode measurement on these scales to constrain the mass power spectrum normalization σ<SUB>8</SUB> and the median redshift z<SUB>m</SUB> of the unidentified radio sources. We find σ<SUB>8</SUB>(z<SUB>m</SUB>/2)<SUP>0.6</SUP>~=1.0+/-0.2, where the 1 σ error bars include statistical errors, cosmic variance, and systematics. This is consistent with earlier determinations of σ<SUB>8</SUB> from cosmic shear, the cosmic microwave background, and cluster abundance, and with our current knowledge of the redshift distribution of radio sources. Taking the prior σ<SUB>8</SUB>=0.9+/-0.1 (68% CL) from the WMAP experiment, this corresponds to z<SUB>m</SUB>=2.2+/-0.9 (68% CL) for radio sources without optical counterparts, consistent with existing models for the radio source luminosity function. Our results offer promising prospects for precision measurements of cosmic shear with future radio interferometers such as LOFAR and the SKA., We present a detailed spectroscopic study of line broadening in the A7IV-V star Altair. In a wavelength region covering 690 Å we reconstruct the overall broadening profile taking into account more than 650 spectral lines. From the broadening profile we determine the projected rotational velocity v sin i, derive an upper limit for the equatorial velocity v from the shape of the profile and search for signatures of differential rotation. Our redetermined value of v sin i is (227 ± 11) km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Measuring the first two zeros of the Fourier transformed broadening profile yields no signatures of differential rotation. We derive that Altair is seen under an inclination angle higher than i = 68<SUP>°</SUP> and it rotates at v &lt; 245 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> or slower than 53% of breakup velocity on a 1σ level. <P />Based on observations carried out at Observatoire de Haute-Provence (OHP), at the German-Spanish Astronomical Centre, Calar Alto, and retrieved from the Elodie Archive at Observatoire de Haute-Provence (OHP)., When applied to deep photometric catalogs, the two-point angular correlation function, ω(θ), is a sensitive probe of the evolution of galaxy clustering properties. Here we present measurements of ω(θ) as a function of I<SUB>AB</SUB> magnitude and (R-I) color to a depth of I<SUB>AB</SUB>=24 on scales θ=7<SUP>''</SUP>-3<SUP>'</SUP>, using a sample of ~350,000 galaxies covering 5 deg<SUP>2</SUP> in total over five separate fields. Using redshifts of 2954 galaxies in early DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey data, we construct robust galaxy redshift distributions as a function of I<SUB>AB</SUB> magnitude and (R-I) color for galaxies in the range 0&lt;z&lt;2. We constrain models of the redshift evolution of galaxy clustering and find that significant growth of clustering has occurred from z&gt;=1 to z=0. A model in which the comoving scale length, x<SUB>0</SUB>, evolves linearly with redshift, x<SUB>0</SUB>(z)=x<SUB>0</SUB>(0)(1-Bz), fits the data better than the ɛ model proposed by Groth &amp; Peebles. The clustering properties depend strongly on observed (R-I) color, with both the reddest and bluest galaxies exhibiting large clustering amplitudes and steeper slopes. Different observed (R-I) color ranges are sensitive to very disparate redshift regimes. Red galaxies with (R-I)~1.5 lie in a narrow redshift range centered at z~0.85 and have a comoving scale length of clustering at z=0.85 of x<SUB>0</SUB>=5.0+/-0.3 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc. These galaxies have early-type spectra and are likely progenitors of massive local ellipticals. The bluest galaxies with (R-I)~0 appear to be a mix of star-forming galaxies, both relatively local (z~0.3-0.6) dwarfs and bright z&gt;1.4 galaxies, as well as broad-line active galactic nuclei. We find that local blue dwarfs are relatively unclustered, with x<SUB>0</SUB>=1.6+/-0.2 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc. The z&gt;1.4 blue galaxies have a larger clustering scale length, x<SUB>0</SUB>&gt;~5 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc., We investigate what the lensing information contained in high resolution, low noise CMB temperature maps can teach us about cluster mass profiles. We create lensing fields and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect maps from N-body simulations and apply them to primary CMB anisotropies modeled as a Gaussian random field. We examine the success of several techniques of cluster mass reconstruction using CMB lensing information, and make an estimate of the observational requirements necessary to achieve a satisfactory result., We present a three-dimensional numerical MHD model of Caltech experiments on spheromak formation also related to the astrophysical jet collimation (Hsu and Bellan, Phys Rev Lett, 90, 215002 (2003); Mon Not R Astron Soc, 334, 257 (2002)). We will describe the initial and boundary conditions in the model which are designed to replicate the experimental setup and show the correspondence between the numerical and experimental parameters. Distinguishing features of the model include the novel formulation of the driving boundary conditions and the use of exponential propagation numerical methods for the time integration of the MHD equations. The plasma dynamics in these strongly driven experiments is found to have a critical dependence on time dependent boundary conditions. We describe the time dependent boundary conditions that involve calculation of tangential boundary magnetic field values from the prescribed flow profile at the boundary. In addition, we will briefly introduce the exponential propagation methods and demonstrate the advantages of these techniques by presenting performance comparisons with commonly used time integrators. Similarities and differences with respect to the experimental measurements will be discussed with particular attention to the parametric dependence of plasma dynamics and magnetic behavior., GaAs photoconductive detectors offer an extended spectral response in the far-infrared (FIR) compared to presently available stressed Ge photoconductors. Furthermore, responsivity at wavelengths up to 330 microns can be reached without having to apply uniaxial stress close to the breaking limit on each pixel. This would greatly simplify the production of detector arrays and therefore allow much larger numbers of pixels. Such arrays are highly demanded for upcoming far-infrared astronomy missions with space and airborne telescopes. However, bulk GaAs photoconductors have only limited sensitivity, due to low absorption and high dark currents. Considerable improvement of the detector performance can be expected from the development of GaAs blocked impurity band (BIB) devices. Our recent crystal growth experiments show that the liquid phase epitaxial (LPE) technique is capable of producing the required purity for the blocking layer. We have also performed far-infrared absorption measurements of doped GaAs layers which demonstrate the spectral range extension to about 330 microns and the enlarged absorption coefficient for the more highly doped absorption layer. Experimental work is supported by numerical modeling of BIB devices done in our group., This paper presents the first dissociative recombination (DR) measurement of electrons with rotationally and vibrationally cold H<SUP>+</SUP><SUB>3</SUB> ions. A dc discharge pinhole supersonic jet source was developed and characterized using infrared cavity ringdown spectroscopy before installation on the CRYRING ion storage ring for the DR measurements. Rotational state distributions ( T<SUB>rot</SUB> ∼30 K ) produced using the source were comparable to those in the diffuse interstellar medium. Our measurement of the electron energy dependence of the DR cross section showed resonances not clearly seen in experiments using rotationally hot ions, and allowed calculation of the thermal DR rate coefficient for ions at interstellar temperatures, α<SUB>DR</SUB> (23 K)=2.6× 10<SUP>-7</SUP> cm<SUP>3</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> . This value is in general agreement with recent theoretical predictions by &lt;article&gt;Kokoouline and Greene [Phys. Rev. A 68, 012703 (2003)&lt;/article&gt;]. The branching fractions of the two breakup channels, H+H+H and H+ H<SUB>2</SUB> , have also been measured for rotationally and vibrationally cold H<SUP>+</SUP><SUB>3</SUB> ., The Pb isotopic compositions of phenocrystic phases in young basaltic lavas have been investigated using the Getty-DePaolo method (Getty S. J. and DePaolo D. J. [1995] Quaternary geochronology by the U-Th-Pb method. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta59, 3267-3272), which allows for the resolution of small isotopic differences. Phenocryst, matrix, and whole rock analyses were made on samples from the 17 Myr-old Imnaha basalts of the Columbia River Group, a zero-age MORB from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and a ca. 260 kyr-old tholeiite from Mount Etna. Plagioclase feldspar phenocrysts have low-(U, Th)/Pb, and in each sample the plagioclase has significantly lower <SUP>206</SUP>Pb/ <SUP>207</SUP>Pb and <SUP>208</SUP>Pb/ <SUP>207</SUP>Pb values than whole rock, matrix, and magnetite-rich separates. The Pb isotopic contrast between plagioclase and matrix/whole rock is found in three samples with varying grain sizes (0.5-2 cm for the Imnaha basalt and MORB and &lt;1 mm for the Etna sample) from different tectonic settings, suggesting that these results are not unique. The isotopic contrasts are only slightly smaller in magnitude than the variations exhibited by whole rock samples from the region. The Imnaha basalts also have Sr isotopic heterogeneity evident only in plagioclase phenocrysts, but the MORB and Etna lavas do not. The isotopic heterogeneities reflect magma mixing, and indicate that isotopically diverse magmas were mixed together just prior to eruption. The results reinforce indications from melt inclusion studies that magma source region isotopic heterogeneities have large amplitudes at short length scales, and that the isotopic variations imparted to the magmas are not entirely homogenized during segregation and transport processes., The Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), one of the largest known flood basalt provinces formed in the Phanerozoic, is associated with the pre-rift stage of the Atlantic Ocean at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary ca. 200 Ma. Paleomagnetic sampling targeted packages of CAMP lava flows in Morocco's High Atlas divided into four basic units (the lower, intermediate, upper, and recurrent units) from sections identified on the basis of field observations and geochemistry. Oriented cores were demagnetized using both alternating field (AF) and thermal techniques. Paleomagnetic results reveal wholly normal polarity interrupted by at least one brief reversed chron located in the intermediate unit, and reveal distinct pulses of volcanic activity identified by discrete changes in declination and inclination. These variations in magnetic direction are interpreted as a record of secular variation, and they may provide an additional correlative tool for identification of spatially separated CAMP lava flows within Morocco. <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>39</SUP>Ar analyses of Moroccan CAMP lavas yield plateau ages indistinguishable within 2σ error limits, sharing a weighted mean age of 199.9±0.5 Ma (2σ), reinforcing the short-lived nature of these eruptions despite the presence of sedimentary horizons between them. Correlation of our sections with the E23n, E23r, E24 sequence reported in the Newark basin terrestrial section and St. Audrie's Bay marine section is suggested. Brief volcanism in sudden pulses is a potential mechanism for volcanic-induced climatic changes and biotic disruption at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. Combination of our directional group (DG) poles yields an African paleomagnetic pole at 200 Ma of λ(°N)=73.0°, ϕ(°E)=241.3° (Dp=5.0°, Dm=18.5°)., The interaction of supernova shocks and interstellar clouds is an important astrophysical phenomenon since it can result in stellar and planetary formation. Our experiments attempt to simulate this mass-loading as it occurs when a shock, for example from a supernova, passes through an interstellar cloud. We drive a strong shock using a 5 kJ laser into a foam-filled cylinder with an imbedded 120 μm Al sphere simulating an interstellar cloud. The density ratio between Al and foam is ∼9. X-ray images (from area and point-projection backlighting) show the sphere getting compressed by the shock (t ≈ 5 ns), undergoing a classical Kelvin-Helmholtz roll-up (10 ns) followed by a Widnall instability (20 ns), an inherently 3D effect that breaks the 2D symmetry of the experiment, and then a second Kelvin-Helmholtz roll-up (40 ns). At late times (80 ns), the former sphere has become undetectable, possibly indicating the transition to a turbulent state. UCRL-POST-205355. Work performed under the auspices of the Department of Energy by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under contract number W-7405-ENG-48., We provide a simple toy model to elucidate the effects of baryonic cooling on predictions of the convergence power spectrum in weak gravitational lensing. Our model suggests that the effects of baryonic cooling on dark matter halo profiles can alter the dark matter power spectrum at k∼10h Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> and lead to percent level changes in the convergence angular power spectrum at wavenumbers of several thousand. These effects would be measurable with planned weak lensing surveys and will impact constraints on cosmological parameters., Bulk dissolution rates for sediment from ODP Site 984A in the North Atlantic are determined using the <SUP>234</SUP>U/ <SUP>238</SUP>U activity ratios of pore water, bulk sediment, and leachates. Site 984A is one of only several sites where closely spaced pore water samples were obtained from the upper 60 meters of the core; the sedimentation rate is high (11-15 cm/ka), hence the sediments in the upper 60 meters are less than 500 ka old. The sediment is clayey silt and composed mostly of detritus derived from Iceland with a significant component of biogenic carbonate (up to 30%). The pore water <SUP>234</SUP>U/ <SUP>238</SUP>U activity ratios are higher than seawater values, in the range of 1.2 to 1.6, while the bulk sediment <SUP>234</SUP>U/ <SUP>238</SUP>U activity ratios are close to 1.0. The <SUP>234</SUP>U/ <SUP>238</SUP>U of the pore water reflects a balance between the mineral dissolution rate and the supply rate of excess <SUP>234</SUP>U to the pore fluid by α-recoil injection of <SUP>234</SUP>Th. The fraction of <SUP>238</SUP>U decays that result in α-recoil injection of <SUP>234</SUP>U to pore fluid is estimated to be 0.10 to 0.20 based on the <SUP>234</SUP>U/ <SUP>238</SUP>U of insoluble residue fractions. The calculated bulk dissolution rates, in units of g/g/yr are in the range of 4 × 10 <SUP>-7</SUP> to 2 × 10 <SUP>-6</SUP> yr <SUP>-1</SUP>. There is significant down-hole variability in pore water <SUP>234</SUP>U/ <SUP>238</SUP>U activity ratios (and hence dissolution rates) on a scale of ca. 10 m. The inferred bulk dissolution rate constants are 100 to 10 <SUP>4</SUP> times slower than laboratory-determined rates, 100 times faster than rates inferred for older sediments based on Sr isotopes, and similar to weathering rates determined for terrestrial soils of similar age. The results of this study suggest that U isotopes can be used to measure in situ dissolution rates in fine-grained clastic materials. The rate estimates for sediments from ODP Site 984 confirm the strong dependence of reactivity on the age of the solid material: the bulk dissolution rate ( R <SUB>d</SUB>) of soils and deep-sea sediments can be approximately described by the expression R <SUB>d</SUB> ≈ 0.1 Age <SUP>-1</SUP> for ages spanning 1000 to 5 × 10 <SUP>8</SUP> yr. The age of the material, which encompasses the grain size, surface area, and other chemical factors that contribute to the rate of dissolution, appears to be a much stronger determinant of dissolution rate than any single physical or chemical property of the system., Jupiter's Icy Moons, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, may possess energy sources, biogenic molecules, and oceans below their icy crusts, thus indicating a strong possibility that they were abodes for present or past life. Life in Earth's icy areas lives in a wide variety of habitats associated with the ice, in the water column below the ice, and on the floor of the ocean below the ice. Similar habitats may exist on JIM, have been transported to the icy crust, and be exposed in tectonic or impact features. Europa has a young, dynamic surface with many outcrops exposing older ice, fresh ice, possible materials from the subsurface ocean, and a few impact craters. Ganymede has older, darker, tectonized terrains surrounded by light ice. Callisto has a much older, heavily impacted surface devoid of significant tectonic structures. Past and present life habitats may be exposed in these features, making Europa the most favorable target while Ganymede is of interest, and Callisto seems more unlikely to have detectable life. A proper search strategy requires detailed orbital imaging and spectrometry of the likely places, and surface data collection with microscopic, spectrometric, and biochemical instruments., We present new observations of the diffuse He I 58.4 nm background recorded in 1998 and 2000 by the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE). This emission is due to resonant scattering of the solar EUV radiation by interstellar and geocoronal helium. Depending on the geometry and relative velocity, a fraction of the interstellar helium glow can be absorbed by the line-of-sight geocoronal gas. The new results are combined with measurements obtained in 1992-93 and previously analyzed by Flynn et al. (\cite{Flynn1998}). A kinetic model of the helium flow is now used to analyze the data and reproduce the absorption features due to geocoronal helium. This allows a precise determination of the interstellar flow bulk velocity vector. A model that includes both photoionization and electron impact ionization was fit to the data set. New constraints on the interstellar helium flow temperature and density, as well as on the solar 58.4 nm line width are obtained. The interstellar helium velocity vector parameters, λ = 74.7 ± 0.5 <SUP>°</SUP>, β = -5.7 ± 0.5 °, V<SUB>He</SUB>= 24.5 ± 2 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, are found to be in good agreement with those derived from particle measurements. Using the solar He I 58.4 nm flux and photoionization rate proxies of McMullin et al. (2003), the neutral helium density and temperature derived from the Long Wavelength Spectrometer data is n<SUB>He</SUB> = 0.013 ± 0.003 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, and T<SUB>He</SUB> = 6500 ± 2000<SUP>o</SUP> respectively, again in good agreement with particle data. However, the width of the downwind cone when scanned across the latitudnal direction tends to be fit better with higher He temperatures, which might indicated latitude anisotropies in the He ionization that we have not included in our models. The solar He I 58.4 nm Doppler width, Δ w<SUB>D</SUB>, is found to be =0.0074 nm, (or 38 ± 3 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) in 1992-1993, i.e. near solar maximum, and Δ w<SUB>D</SUB>= 0.0087 nm (45 ± 3 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) in 1998, after solar minimum, in agreement with SOHO SUMER and CDS results, although again, the 1998 fits near solar minimum might suffer from latitudinal anisotropies., We present new premaximum and late-time optical photometry of the Type Ia/IIn supernova 2002ic. These observations are combined with the published V-band magnitudes of Hamuy and coauthors and the VLT spectrophotometry of Wang and coauthors to construct the most extensive light curve to date of this unusual supernova. The observed flux at late time is significantly higher relative to the flux at maximum than that of any other observed Type Ia supernova and continues to fade very slowly a year after the explosion. Our analysis of the light curve suggests that a non-Type Ia supernova component becomes prominent ~20 days after explosion. Modeling of the non-Type Ia supernova component as heating from the shock interaction of the supernova ejecta with preexisting circumstellar material suggests the presence of a ~1.7×10<SUP>15</SUP> cm gap or trough between the progenitor system and the surrounding circumstellar material. This gap could be due to significantly lower mass loss ~15(v<SUB>w</SUB>/10kms<SUP>-1</SUP>)<SUP>-1</SUP> yr prior to explosion or evacuation of the circumstellar material by a low-density fast wind. The latter is consistent with observed properties of protoplanetary nebulae and with models of white dwarf + asymptotic giant branch star progenitor systems with the asymptotic giant branch star in the protoplanetary nebula phase., Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) theory has been used in space physics for more than forty years, yet many important questions about space plasmas remain unanswered. We still do not understand how the solar wind is accelerated, how mass, momentum and energy are transported into the magnetosphere and what mechanisms initiate substorms. Questions have been raised from the beginning of the space era whether MHD theory can describe correctly space plasmas that are collisionless and rarely in thermal equilibrium. Ideal MHD fluids do not induce electromotive force, hence they lose the capability to interact electromagnetically. No currents and magnetic fields are generated, rendering ideal MHD theory not very useful for space plasmas. Observations from the plasma sheet are used as examples to show how collisionless plasmas behave. Interpreting these observations using MHD and ideal MHD concepts can lead to misleading conclusions. Notably, the bursty bulk flows (BBF) with large mean velocities left( &lt; v &gt;≥400 km s right) that have been interpreted previously as E× B flows are shown to involve much more complicated physics. The sources of these nonvanishing &lt; v &gt; events, while still not known, are intimately related to mechanisms that create large phase space gradients that include beams and acceleration of ions to MeV energies. The distributions of these nonvanishing &lt; v &gt; events are associated with large amplitude variations of the magnetic field at frequencies up to and exceeding the local Larmor frequency where MHD theory is not valid. Understanding collisionless plasma dynamics such as substorms in the plasma sheet requires the self-consistency that only kinetic theory can provide. Kinetic modeling is still undergoing continual development with many studies limited to one and two dimensions, but there is urgent need to improve these models as more and more data show kinetic physics is fundamentally important. Only then will we be able to make progress and obtain a correct picture of how collisionless plasmas work in space., We describe the development of an antenna-coupled bolometer array for use in a Cosmic Microwave Background polarization experiment. Prototype single pixels using double-slot dipole antennas and integrated microstrip band defining filters have been built and tested. Preliminary results of optical testing and simulations are presented. A bolometer array design based on this pixel will also be shown and future plans for application of the technology will be discussed., The existence of massive black holes (BHs) in many or most nearby galactic centers, predicted by some arguments on QSO energetics and demography, has been confirmed. In this paper we present several expected quantitative relations between QSOs and local BHs. Comparison of these relations with observations may provide constraints on BH growth and QSO models. We especially show that the luminosity evolution of individual QSOs can be constrained by comparing the time integral of the QSO luminosity function with the expectation from local BHs. We also further show how to predict the BH mass versus velocity dispersion relation in QSOs/AGNs. Possible directions of future work are discussed., Magnesium silicates are the dominant minerals in the earth's mantle. Their preferred orientation is important for understanding the rheology and seismic anisotropy in the deep earth. Here we report results of radial synchrotron diffraction diamond anvil cell (DAC) experiments on San Carlos olivine, axially compressed to 50 GPa. Experiments were performed at room temperature, except for brief laser heating to induce phase transformations. High stresses and development of preferred orientation were observed in diffraction images. Quantitative texture information was obtained by analyzing the images with the Rietveld method. With increasing pressure (between 9 and 43 GPa) olivine develops a texture with [001] axes perpendicular to the compression direction that is compatible with {hk0}[001] pencil glide. Ringwoodite (between 20 and 50 GPa) develops weak preferred orientation with {011} lattice planes perpendicular to the compression direction. After the phase transformation, perovskite and magnesiowüstite display transformation textures that are then modified by continuing deformation. Magnesiowüstite has a weak &lt;111&gt; maximum parallel to the compression direction that changes towards &lt;001&gt; with increasing deformation. Perovskite, transforming from olivine, has a pronounced (100) transformation texture and with increasing deformation a {012} maximum develops. The transformation texture is probably produced by mechanical {110} twinning and nucleation in orientations that minimize elastic strain energy. The deformation texture of perovskite is due to slip., We describe the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) satellite that was launched in April 2003 specifically to accomplish far ultraviolet (FUV) and near ultraviolet (NUV) imaging and spectroscopic sky-surveys. GALEX is currently providing new and significant information on how galaxies form and evolve over a period that encompasses 80% of the history of the Universe. This is being accomplished by the precise measurement of the UV brightness of galaxies which is a direct measurement of their rate of star formation. We briefly describe the design of the GALEX mission followed by an overview of the instrumentation that comprises the science payload. We then focus on a description of the development of the UV sealed tube micro-channel plate detectors and provide data that describe their on-orbit performance. Finally, we provide a short overview of some of the science highlights obtained with GALEX., The proton aurora imager SI-12 on the IMAGE spacecraft occasionally observes subauroral morning proton spots (SAMPS) that rotate with 70-95% of the Earth's corotation speed. Coincident particle measurements by DMSP confirm the source to be pure precipitating protons with mean energies likely above the detector limit of 30 keV. The spots appear in the recovery phase after magnetic storms and last for 1-4 hours in the magnetic local time region of 0300-1200 hours. The latitude location is strongly related to the minimum Dst of the previous geomagnetic storm with the lowest latitude observations after the strongest storms. The rotation speed is related to the latitude (L shell) of the spots with the largest corotation lags for spots that map to the largest L shells. IMAGE-EUV observations of the plasmasphere indicate a relationship with density gradients in the expanding plasmasphere after magnetic storms. We interpret these spots as the result of wave-particle interaction. As one likely process, we suggest the interaction of ring current protons with electromagnetic ion-cyclotron (EMIC) waves as a result of the expansion and subrotation of the dense, cold plasmasphere ions. The appearance of subauroral proton spots is therefore a consequence of the plasmasphere refilling after geomagnetic storms., One of the major challenges of space weather research and modeling is the identification of the mechanism(s) for coronal mass ejections (CMEs). A leading candidate tested in several recent numerical simulations is photospheric magnetic flux cancellation by velocity convergence toward the neutral line of an active region having sheared or twisted magnetic fields. These attributes have been assumed in various combinations in modeling studies, but little observational work has been done that demonstrates their presence. In this paper, we show observational evidence that this process is at work in two different types of repetitively eruptive active regions in late 1996 and early 1997. The horizontal velocity field is obtained by applying Local Correlation Tracking (LCT) technique to sequences of photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms., Mission requirements, the baseline design, and optical systems budgets for the SuperNova/Acceleration Probe (SNAP) telescope are presented. SNAP is a proposed space-based experiment designed to study dark energy and alternate explanations of the acceleration of the universe""s expansion by performing a series of complementary systematics-controlled astrophysical measurements. The goals of the mission are a Type Ia supernova Hubble diagram and a wide-field weak gravitational lensing survey. A 2m widefield three-mirror telescope feeds a focal plane consisting of 36 CCDs and 36 HgCdTe detectors and a high-efficiency, low resolution integral field spectrograph. Details of the maturing optical system, with emphasis on structural stability during terrestrial testing as well as expected environments during operations at L2 are discussed. The overall stray light mitigation system, including illuminated surfaces and visible objects are also presented., This paper describes the 3D simulation of a space weather event using the coupled model approach adopted by the Center for Integrated Space Weather Modeling (CISM). The simulation employs corona, solar wind, and magnetosphere MHD models, and an upper atmosphere/ionosphere fluid dynamic model, with interfaces that exchange parameters specifying each component of the connected solar terrestrial system. A hypothetical coronal mass ejection is launched from the Sun by a process emulating photospheric field changes such as are observed with solar magnetographs. The associated ejected magnetic flux rope propagates into a realistically structured solar wind, producing a leading interplanetary shock, sheath, and magnetic cloud. These reach 1 AU where the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field parameters are used to drive the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupled model in the same manner as upstream in situ measurements. The simulated magnetosphere responds with a magnetic storm, producing enhanced convection and auroral energy inputs to the upper atmosphere/ionosphere. These results demonstrate the potential for future studies using a modular, systemic numerical modeling approach to space weather research and forecasting., We report on attempts to broaden the IF bandwidth of the BIMA 1mm SIS receivers by cascading fixed tuned double-sideband (DSB) SIS mixers and wideband MMIC IF amplifiers. To obtain the flattest receiver gain across the IF band we tested three schemes for keeping the mixer and amplifier as electrically close as possible. In Receiver I, we connected separate mixer and MMIC modules by a 1"" stainless steel SMA elbow. In Receiver II, we integrated mixer and MMIC into a modified BIMA mixer module. In Receiver III, we devised a thermally split block where mixer and MMIC can be maintained at different temperatures in the same module. The best average receiver noise we achieved by combining SIS mixer and MMIC amplifier is 45 -50 K DSB for νLO = 215 - 240 GHz and below 80 K DSB for νLO = 205 - 270 GHz. The receiver noise can be made reasonably flat over the CARMA IF band (νIF = 1 - 5 GHz). Noise temperatures for all three receivers are comparable to or better than those obtained with the BIMA receiver., A new hybrid optical detector is described that has many of the attributes desired for the next generation AO wavefront sensors. The detector consists of a proximity focused MCP read out by four multi-pixel application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips developed at CERN (""Medipix2"") with individual pixels that amplify, discriminate and count input events. The detector has 512 x 512 pixels, zero readout noise (photon counting) and can be read out at 1kHz frame rates. The Medipix2 readout chips can be electronically shuttered down to a temporal window of a few microseconds with an accuracy of 10 nanoseconds. When used in a Shack-Hartman style wavefront sensor, it should be able to centroid approximately 5000 spots using 7 x 7 pixel sub-apertures resulting in very linear, off-null error correction terms. The quantum efficiency depends on the optical photocathode chosen for the bandpass of interest. A three year development effort for this detector technology has just been funded as part of the first Adaptive Optics Development Program managed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory., Several recent papers have studied lensing of the CMB by large-scale structures, which probes the projected matter distribution from z=10<SUP>3</SUP> to z≃0. This interest is motivated in part by upcoming high resolution, high sensitivity CMB experiments, such as APEX/SZ, ACT, SPT or Planck, which should be sensitive to lensing. In this paper, we examine the reconstruction of the large-scale dark matter distribution from lensed CMB temperature anisotropies. We go beyond previous work in using numerical simulations to include higher order, non-Gaussian effects and find that the convergence and its power spectrum are biased, with the bias increasing with the angular resolution. We also study the contamination by the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signal, which is spectrally indistinguishable from lensed CMB anisotropies, and find that it leads to an overestimate of the convergence. We finish by estimating the sensitivity of the previously cited experiments and find that all of them could detect the lensing effect, but would be biased at around the 10% level., The least understood component of the Sun-to-Earth coupled system is the solar atmosphere—the visible layers of the Sun that encompass the photosphere, chromosphere, transition region and low corona. Coronal mass ejections (CMEs), principal drivers of space weather, are magnetically driven phenomena that are thought to originate in the low solar corona. Their initiation mechanism, however, is still a topic of great debate. If we are to develop physics-based models with true predictive capability, we must progress beyond simulations of highly idealized magnetic configurations, and develop the techniques necessary to incorporate observations of the vector magnetic field at the solar photosphere into numerical models of the solar corona. As a first step toward this goal, we drive the SAIC coronal model with the complex magnetic fields and flows that result from a sub-photospheric MHD simulation of an emerging active region. In particular, we successfully emerge a twisted Ω-loop into a pre-existing coronal arcade. <P />To date, it is not possible to directly measure the magnetic field in the solar corona. Instead, we must rely on non-potential extrapolations to generate the twisted, pre-eruptive coronal topologies necessary to initiate data-driven MHD simulations of CMEs. We therefore investigate whether a non-constant-α force-free extrapolation can successfully reproduce the magnetic features of a self-consistent MHD simulation of flux emergence through a stratified model atmosphere. We generate force-free equilibria from simulated photospheric and chromospheric vector magnetograms, and compare these results to the MHD calculation. We then apply these techniques to an IVM (Mees Solar Observatory) vector magnetogram of NOAA active-region 8210, a source of a number of eruptive events on the Sun., We describe the simulation data produced by a pilot programme to compute mock weak gravitational lensing maps for a range of currently popular cosmological models by ray tracing through high-resolution N-body simulations. The programme required only a modest investment in computer time to produce maps accurate to arcminute scales covering hundreds of square degrees of sky for four cosmological models., It is shown that atom interferometry allows for the construction of MIGO, the Matter-wave Interferometric Gravitational-wave Observatory. MIGOs of the same sensitivity as LIGO or LISA are expected to be orders of magnitude smaller than either one. A design for MIGO using crystalline diffraction gratings is introduced, and its sensitivity is calculated., Simple models are constructed for 'acceleressence' dark energy: the latent heat of a phase transition occurring in a hidden sector governed by the seesaw mass scale v<SUP>2</SUP>/M<SUB>Pl</SUB>, where v is the electroweak scale and M<SUB>Pl</SUB> the gravitational mass scale. In our models, the seesaw scale is stabilized by supersymmetry, implying that the LHC must discover superpartners with a spectrum that reflects a low scale of fundamental supersymmetry breaking. Newtonian gravity may be modified by effects arising from the exchange of fields in the acceleressence sector whose Compton wavelengths are typically of order the millimetre scale. There are two classes of models. In the first class the universe is currently in a metastable vacuum and will continue to inflate until tunnelling processes eventually induce a first-order transition. In the simplest such model, the range of the new force is bounded to be larger than 25 µm in the absence of fine-tuning of parameters, and for couplings of order unity it is expected to be approx 100 µm. In the second class of models thermal effects maintain the present vacuum energy of the universe, but on further cooling, the universe will 'soon' smoothly relax to a matter dominated era. In this case, the range of the new force is also expected to be of order the millimetre scale or larger, although its strength is uncertain. A firm prediction of this class of models is the existence of additional energy density in radiation at the eV era, which can potentially be probed in precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background. An interesting possibility is that the transition towards a matter dominated era has occurred in the very recent past, with the consequence that the universe is currently decelerating., A statistical analysis of coronal loop oscillations observed by the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) shows that 12 of 28 cases were associated with metric type II bursts. The timing is consistent with the idea that in many cases the loop oscillations result from the passage of a large-scale wave disturbance originating in a flare in the nearby active region. The GOES classifications for these flares range from C4.2 to X20. Typically, the oscillating structures are not disrupted, implying that the disturbance has passed through the medium, which has returned to an equilibrium near that seen prior to the event. This is consistent with the Uchida interpretation of the disturbance as a weak fast-mode blast wave (i.e., a simple wave at a low Alfvénic Mach number) propagating in the ambient corona. We note that all 12 of the associated events were also associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and conclude that the CME eruptions in these cases corresponded to only partial openings of the active-region magnetic fields., Since the discovery of Dactyl orbiting around Ida by the Galileo spacecraft in 1993, over twenty-five binary asteroid systems have been discovered using radar, direct imaging and Adaptive Optics observations. Asteroidal moon discoveries dramatically increased with the advent of this last technique on ground based telescopes. Our group focuses on the search and study of double asteroids in the main-belt, in the Trojan population and beyond Neptune's orbit. We have been using several of the AO systems available (Lick-3m, Palomar-5m, VLT-8m, Keck-10m) and related techniques such as Appulse and Laser Guide Star observations to broaden the sample of asteroids observed from the main-belt out to the Kuiper Belt. We will present a quality comparison between various techniques and different AO systems with NGS and will detail our first successful observations with the Lick LGS system. Precise orbital elements of the secondary can be determined by multiple observations spanning large periods of time (several months). Our group developed a method to predict the ephemeris of a secondary companion. Without any assumptions, this method, tested successfully on 22 Kalliope and 121 Hermione binary systems, leads to the direct determination of important physical parameters of the targets, such as their mass and the interior structure, as well as gives direct insights on their formation processes that may be otherwise only be speculated on from spacecraft mission flybys., Current and future large telescopes depend critically on laser guide star adaptive optics (LGS AO) to achieve their scientific goals. However, there are still relatively few scientific results reported from existing LGS AO systems. We present some of the first science results from the Lick Observatory sodium beacon LGS AO system. We achieve high sensitivity to light scattered in the circumstellar enviroment of Herbig Ae/Be stars on scales of 100-200 AU by coupling the LGS AO system to a near-infrared (J,H,K<SUB>s</SUB> bands) dual channel imaging polarimeter. We describe the design, implementation, and performance of this instrument. The dominant noise source near bright stars in AO images is a ""seeing halo"" of uncorrected speckles, and since these speckles are unpolarized, dual-channel polarimetry achieves a significant contrast gain. Our observations reveal a wide range of morphologies, including bipolar nebulosities with and without outflow-evacuated cavities and disk-mediated interaction among members of a binary. These data suggest that the evolutionary picture developed for the lower-mass T Tauri stars is also relevant to the Herbig Ae/Be stars, and demonstrate the ability of LGS AO systems to enhance the scientific capabilities of even modest sized telescopes., We propose signals in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) to probe the type and spectrum of neutrino masses. In theories that have spontaneous breaking of approximate lepton flavor symmetries at or below the weak scale, light pseudo-Goldstone bosons recouple to the cosmic neutrinos after nucleosynthesis and affect the acoustic oscillations of the electron-photon fluid during the eV era. Deviations from the Standard Model are predicted for both the total energy density in radiation during this epoch, ΔN<SUB>ν</SUB>, and for the multipole of the n’th CMB peak at large n, Δl<SUB>n</SUB>. The latter signal is difficult to reproduce other than by scattering of the known neutrinos, and is therefore an ideal test of our class of theories. In many models, the large shift Δl<SUB>n</SUB>≈8n<SUB>S</SUB> depends on the number of neutrino species that scatter via the pseudo-Goldstone boson interaction. This interaction is proportional to the neutrino masses, so that the signal reflects the neutrino spectrum. The prediction for ΔN<SUB>ν</SUB> is highly model dependent, but can be accurately computed within any given model. It is very sensitive to the number of pseudo-Goldstone bosons, and therefore to the underlying symmetries of the leptons, and is typically in the region of 0.03&lt;ΔN<SUB>ν</SUB>&lt;1. This signal is significantly larger for Majorana neutrinos than for Dirac neutrinos, and, like the scattering signal, varies as the spectrum of neutrinos is changed from hierarchical to inverse hierarchical to degenerate., We study the generalized Unruh effect for accelerated reference frames that include rotation in addition to acceleration. We focus particularly on the case where the motion is planar, with the presence of a static limit in addition to the event horizon. Possible definitions of an accelerated vacuum state are examined and the interpretation of the Minkowski vacuum state as a thermodynamic state is discussed. Such a thermodynamic state is shown to depend on two parameters, the acceleration temperature and a drift velocity, which are determined by the acceleration and angular velocity of the accelerated frame. We relate the properties of the Minkowski vacuum in the accelerated frame to the excitation spectrum of a detector that is stationary in this frame. The detector can be excited both by absorbing positive energy quanta in the “hot” vacuum state and by emitting negative energy quanta into the “ergosphere” between the horizon and the static limit. The effects are related to similar effects in the gravitational field of a rotating black hole., At present no theory of a massive graviton is known that is consistent with experiments at both long and short distances. The problem is that consistency with long distance experiments requires the graviton mass to be very small. Such a small graviton mass however implies an ultraviolet cutoff for the theory at length scales far larger than the millimeter scale at which gravity has already been measured. In this paper we attempt to construct a model which avoids this problem. We consider a brane world setup in warped anti- de Sitter spacetime and we investigate the consequences of writing a mass term for the graviton on an infrared brane where the local cutoff is of order a large (galactic) distance scale. The advantage of this setup is that the low cutoff for physics on the infrared brane does not significantly affect the predictivity of the theory for observers localized on the ultraviolet brane. For such observers the predictions of this theory agree with general relativity at distances smaller than the infrared scale but go over to those of a theory of massive gravity at longer distances. A careful analysis of the graviton two-point function, however, reveals the presence of a ghost in the low energy spectrum. A mode decomposition of the higher dimensional theory reveals that the ghost corresponds to the radion field. We also investigate the theory with a brane-localized mass for the graviton on the ultraviolet brane, and show that the physics of this case is similar to that of a conventional four dimensional theory with a massive graviton, but with one important difference: when the infrared brane decouples and the would-be massive graviton gets heavier than the regular Kaluza-Klein modes, it becomes unstable and it has a finite width to decay off the brane into the continuum of Kaluza-Klein states., Over the first 2.5 years of operation, the FUV instrument on the IMAGE spacecraft observed more than 2400 substorm onsets in the Northern Hemisphere. The observations confirm earlier results of statistical studies in terms of a median substorm onset location at 2300 hours MLT and 66.4 degrees magnetic latitude. The purpose of this report is to publish the list to allow for further investigation. The list can easily be searched for onsets close to certain ground stations or at specific magnetic latitudes or local times. As one example of such use, we demonstrate how the probability of onset observation was determined for the ground-based automatic observatories of the THEMIS (Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms) project., Objectives for the next generation of UV microchannel plate astronomical detectors include development of efficient photocathodes, including gallium nitride (GaN), and diamond, and optimization of silicon based MCPs. Goals include the development of GaN photocathodes in sealed tube and open detectors with &gt;50% DQE in the UV (&gt;110nm), with tunable cutoffs around 400nm. Activated diamond photocathodes with &gt;40% DQE @ &gt;110nm, cutoffs &gt;200nm, and their application to Si MCPs are also of interest. GaN photocathodes have been developed with efficiencies &gt;60% and cutoffs of ~380nm. Diamond photocathodes with ~40% efficiency at 40nm have been achieved, and Cs activation shows promise for high efficiencies (&gt;20% at 180nm). Silicon based MCPs have qualities that make them preferable to glass MCPs (very low intrinsic background, low fixed pattern noise). Large 8cm Si MCPs have been fabricated with large open area ratio, good lifetest data has been obtained, and techniques for coating high temperature/robust photocathode layers have been explored. We also report on a novel MCP imaging readout scheme, the Cross Strip (XS). This anode uses charge division, and centroiding, of microchannel plate charge signals detected on two orthogonal layers of sense strips to encode event X-Y positions, time tags and signal amplitudes. The XS anode is fabricated as a multilayer ceramic/metal structure that can be implemented in a footprint that is not much larger than the active area, and may accommodate formats up to 10cm x 10cm. To date the XS scheme has been tested with a 32 mm x 32 mm prototype anode and customized electronics. This has demonstrated excellent resolution (&lt;7µm FWHM, ~5k x 5k resolution elements (limited by the MCP pore size)) using low MCP gain (~4 x 10<SUP>5</SUP>), with anode &amp; electronics resolution of ~3µm FWHM., We model gas and dust emission from regions 0.3-20 AU from a central low-mass star in intermediate-aged (~10<SUP>7</SUP> yr) disks whose dust is fairly optically thin to stellar radiation. The models treat thermal balance and chemistry self-consistently and calculate the vertical density and temperature structure of the gas in a disk. The gas and dust temperatures are calculated separately. The models cover gas masses 10<SUP>-3</SUP> to 1 M<SUB>J</SUB> and dust masses 10<SUP>-7</SUP> to 10<SUP>-4</SUP> M<SUB>J</SUB> and treat solar-type (G and K) stars. We focus on mid-infrared and far-infrared emission lines from various gas species such as the rotational lines of H<SUB>2</SUB>, OH, H<SUB>2</SUB>O, and CO molecules and the fine-structure lines of carbon, oxygen, sulfur, iron, and silicon atoms and ions. These lines and the dust continuum are observable by the Spitzer Space Telescope and future missions including SOFIA and the Herschel Space Observatory. We find that the [S I] 25.23 μm line is the strongest emission line for a wide range of disk and stellar parameters, followed by emission from [Si II] 34.8 μm, [Fe II] 26 μm, and [O I] 63 μm. [Fe I] 24 μm and rotational lines of OH and H<SUB>2</SUB>O are strong when gas masses are high (&gt;~0.1 M<SUB>J</SUB>). Emission from the rotational lines of H<SUB>2</SUB> is more difficult to detect unless disk gas masses are substantial (&gt;~0.1 M<SUB>J</SUB>). For emission from H<SUB>2</SUB> lines to be observable and yet for the dust to be optically thin in stellar light, the ratio of gas to small submillimeter-sized dust particle mass in the disk needs to be &gt;~1000, or at least an order of magnitude higher than that in the interstellar medium. This may be possible at intermediate stages in disk evolution, such as in the gas-gathering stage of the core accretion scenario for giant planet formation, in which most of the dust has coagulated into larger objects (&gt;&gt;1 mm) but the gas has not yet fully dispersed. Whereas the absolute fluxes observed in some lines such as [Fe I] 24 μm and H<SUB>2</SUB> S(0) 28 μm primarily measure the gas mass in the disks, various line ratios diagnose the inner radius of the gas and the radial temperature and surface density distribution of the gas. Many lines become optically thick and/or suffer chemical or thermal effects such that the line luminosities do not increase appreciably with increasing gas mass. We predict that it may be difficult for the Spitzer Space Telescope to detect &lt;~1 M<SUB>J</SUB> of gas in optically thin (in dust) disks at distances &gt;~150 pc. The models presented here will be useful in future infrared studies of the timescale for the dispersion of gas in a planet-forming disk and tests of core accretion models of giant planet formation., We present results of near-IR spectroscopic measurements of seven star-forming galaxies at 2.1&lt;z&lt;2.5. Drawn from a large spectroscopic survey of galaxies photometrically preselected by their U<SUB>n</SUB>GR colors to lie at z~2, these galaxies were chosen for their bright rest-frame optical luminosities (K<SUB>s</SUB>&lt;=20.0). Most strikingly, the majority of the sample of seven galaxies exhibit [N II]/Hα nebular emission-line ratios indicative of at least solar H II region metallicities, at a look-back time of 10.5 Gyr. The broadband colors of the K<SUB>s</SUB>-bright sample indicate that most have been forming stars for more than a gigayear at z~2 and have already formed stellar masses in excess of 10<SUP>11</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB>. The descendants of these galaxies in the local universe are most likely metal-rich and massive spiral and elliptical galaxies, while plausible progenitors for them can be found among the population of z~3 Lyman break galaxies. While the K<SUB>s</SUB>-bright z~2 galaxies appear to be highly evolved systems, their large Hα luminosities and uncorrected Hα star formation rates of 24-60 M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> indicate that active star formation is still ongoing. The luminous UV-selected objects presented here comprise more than half of the high-redshift (z&gt;1.5) tails of current K-band-selected samples such as the K20 and Gemini Deep Deep surveys. <P />Based in part on data obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership between the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA, and was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation., The astrophysical origin of the r-process nuclei is unknown. Because of their association with supernovae and intrinsic neutron-richness, protoneutron star winds are considered as a likely candidate site for production of the r-process nuclei. However, most models of winds from ""canonical"" neutron stars with mass of 1.4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radius of 10 km fail to generate the heaviest r-process nuclei. In this proceedings we provide a brief review of the protoneutron star wind scenario and discuss the emergence of these outflows in the context of fully dynamical models of successful core-collapse supernovae. That standard models fail motivates an exploration of more extreme neutron star environments. We address some issues surrounding winds from highly magnetic (B<SUB>0</SUB> ≳ 10<SUP>15</SUP> G) protoneutron stars ('proto-magnetars'), including magnetic trapping of wind material and entropy amplification. We further speculate on the role of rapid rotation in this context and the resulting nucleosynthesis., We perform a set of analogue wax experiments aimed at understanding the processes and conditions that lead to lineament formation on Europa. We heat a layer of wax from below and cool it from above so that a solid layer of wax forms above a molten layer, simulating either the liquid ocean or the actively convecting part of the ice shell. The solid layer of wax is then deformed periodically, simulating the cyclic strain caused by tides or by the satellite's nonsynchronous rotation. We find that the formation and morphology of lineaments that develop in the solid wax layer are governed by two main dimensionless parameters: Ψ, the ratio of the cooling timescale for the solid layer to the deformation timescale, and the dilation quotient γ, which is defined as the magnitude of net extension during one cycle of deformation divided by the amplitude of the periodic deformation. For Ψ ~ 1, features form that qualitatively resemble bands and ridge complexes on Europa. We conclude that diurnal tides may be responsible for the formation of bands on Europa if the conducting layer of ice is a few hundred meters thick and is underlain by a convecting layer of ice. Features resembling double ridges can form if the ice shell has a thickness of a few kilometers and periodic strains are caused by Europa's nonsynchronous rotation., Winds from massive stars supply ~10<SUP>-3</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> of gas to the central parsec of the Galactic center. I present spherically symmetric hydrodynamic simulations of the dynamics of this gas. These calculations show that a few percent of the gas, or ~few×10<SUP>-5</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, flows in toward the central massive black hole Sgr A*; the remaining gas, ~10<SUP>-3</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, is thermally driven out of the central star cluster in a wind. This dynamical model accounts for the level of diffuse X-ray emission observed in the central 10"" of the Galactic center by Chandra and the extended X-ray source coincident with Sgr A*; the latter is a signature of gas being gravitationally captured by the black hole., Anisotropic gravitational radiation from a coalescing black hole binary can impart a recoil velocity of up to several hundred kilometers per second to the remnant black hole. We examine the effects of recoiling massive black holes on their host stellar bulges, both for holes that escape their host and for those that return to the galactic center via dynamical friction. We show that removal of a black hole via radiation recoil generally results in a rapidly formed central core in the stellar system, with the effect being largest when the hole stays bound to the bulge and the recoil velocity is comparable to the bulge velocity dispersion. Black hole recoil therefore provides a mechanism for producing cores in some early-type galaxies, but it is expected to be most efficient in faint elliptical galaxies that are known to have steep density profiles. We argue that these results may hint at a significant role for gas in facilitating the coalescence of binary black holes in faint (power-law) early-type galaxies., The abundances of <SUP>18</SUP>O and deuterium in the present and past hydrologic cycle have proven to be an important tool in Earth systems science. In contrast, the abundance of <SUP>17</SUP>O in precipitation has thus far been assumed to carry no additional information to that of <SUP>18</SUP>O. Here, we demonstrate, using known constraints on oxygen isotope abundances from the O <SUB>2</SUB> cycle and existing data about the natural abundance of <SUP>17</SUP>O in water, that the relationship between the discrimination against <SUP>17</SUP>O and <SUP>18</SUP>O in water may vary. This relationship, presented here as θ = ln ( <SUP>17</SUP>α)/ln ( <SUP>18</SUP>α), is found to be 0.511 ± 0.005 for kinetic transport effects and 0.526 ± 0.001 for equilibrium effects, with very low temperature sensitivity. As a result, the <SUP>17</SUP>Δ of precipitation is controlled primarily by kinetic effects during evaporation of the initial vapor and, in contrast to the deuterium excess, is independent of the temperature at the evaporation (and condensation) site. This makes <SUP>17</SUP>Δ a unique tracer that complements <SUP>18</SUP>O and deuterium, and may allow for a decoupling of changes in the temperature of the ocean, that serves as the vapor source, from changes in the relative humidity above it. In addition, the <SUP>17</SUP>Δ of ice caps is influenced by the kinetic effects in ice formation, and therefore measurement of ice <SUP>17</SUP>Δ can be used as an additional constraint for better understanding and parameterization of these effects., We present the results of a high-resolution spectroscopic monitoring program of the eclipsing pre-main-sequence star KH 15D that reveal it to be a single-lined spectroscopic binary. We find that the best-fit Keplerian model has a period P=48.38 days, which is nearly identical to the photometric period. Thus, we find the best explanation for the periodic dimming of KH 15D is that the binary motion carries the currently visible star alternately above and behind the edge of an obscuring cloud. The data are consistent with the models involving an inclined circumstellar disk, as recently proposed by Winn et al. and Chiang &amp; Murray-Clay. We show that the mass ratio expected from models of pre-main-sequence evolution, together with the mass constraints for the visible star, restrict the orbital eccentricity to 0.68&lt;=e&lt;=0.80 and the mass function to 0.125M<SUB>solar</SUB>&lt;=F<SUB>M</SUB>/sin3i&lt;=0.5 M<SUB>solar</SUB>. <P />Based on observations obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the Naional Aeronautics and Space Administration; at Las Campanas Observatory of the Carnegie Institution with the Magellan II Clay Telescope; and at McDonald Observatory of the University of Texas at Austin., We examine the hypothesis that hydrostatic pressure alone determines the ratio of atomic to molecular gas averaged over a particular radius in disk galaxies. The hypothesis implies that the transition radius, the location where the ratio is unity, should always occur at the same value of stellar surface density in all galaxies. We examine data for 28 galaxies and find that the stellar surface density at the transition radius is indeed constant to within 40% at a value of 120 M<SUB>solar</SUB> pc<SUP>-2</SUP>. If the hypothesis can be confirmed at all radii within a large range of galaxy types and metallicities, combining it with the observed relation between the star formation rate and H<SUB>2</SUB> surface density may enable us to derive a physically motivated star formation prescription with wide applicability., We use numerical simulations to model the effect of seeing and extinction modulations on weak lensing surveys. We find that systematic fluctuations in the shear amplitude and source depth can give rise to changes in the E-mode signal and to B-modes of varying amplitudes. Exquisite control of such systematics will be required as we approach the era of precision cosmology with weak lensing., Most stars previously identified as Maunder minimum stars are old and evolved off the main sequence. Analysis of activity measurements from the California and Carnegie Planet Search program stars and Hipparcos parallaxes implies that the canonical relation between age and chromospheric activity breaks down for stars older than ~6 Gyr when activity is calculated from Mount Wilson S-values. Stars only 1 mag above the main sequence exhibit significantly suppressed activity levels, which have been mistaken for examples of Maunder minimum behavior. <P />Based on observations obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Keck Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation., The in situ measurements of the Galileo Probe Mass Spectrometer (GPMS) were expected to constrain the abundances of the cloud-forming condensible volatile gases: H <SUB>2</SUB>O, H <SUB>2</SUB>S, and NH <SUB>3</SUB>. However, since the probe entry site (PES) was an unusually dry meteorological system—a 5-μm hotspot—the measured condensible volatile abundances did not follow the canonical condensation-limited vertical profiles of equilibrium cloud condensation models (ECCMs) such as Weidenschilling and Lewis (1973, Icarus 20, 465-476). Instead, the mixing ratios of H <SUB>2</SUB>S and NH <SUB>3</SUB> increased with depth, finally reaching well-mixed equilibration levels at pressures far greater than the lifting condensation levels, whereas the mixing ratio of H <SUB>2</SUB>O in the deep well-mixed atmosphere could not be measured. The deep NH <SUB>3</SUB> mixing ratio (with respect to H <SUB>2</SUB>) of (6.64±2.54)×10 <SUP>-4</SUP> from 8.9-11.7 bar GPMS data is consistent with the NH <SUB>3</SUB> profile from probe-to-orbiter signal attenuation (Folkner et al., 1998, J. Geophys. Res. 103, 22847-22856), which had an equilibration level of about 8 bar. The GPMS deep atmosphere H <SUB>2</SUB>S mixing ratio of (8.9±2.1)×10 <SUP>-5</SUP> is the only measurement of Jupiter's sulfur abundance, with a PES equilibration level somewhere between 12 and 15.5 bar. The deepest water mixing ratio measurement is (4.9±1.6)×10 <SUP>-4</SUP> (corresponding to only about 30% of the solar abundance) at 17.6-20.9 bar, a value that is probably much smaller than Jupiter's bulk water abundance. The <SUP>15</SUP>N/ <SUP>14</SUP>N ratio in jovian NH <SUB>3</SUB> was measured at (2.3±0.3)×10 <SUP>-3</SUP> and may provide the best estimate of the protosolar nitrogen isotopic ratio. The GPMS methane mixing ratio is (2.37±0.57)×10 <SUP>-3</SUP>; although methane does not condense on Jupiter, we include its updated analysis in this report because like the condensible volatiles, it was presumably brought to Jupiter in icy planetesimals. Our detailed discussion of calibration and error analysis supplements previously reported GPMS measurements of condensible volatile mixing ratios (Niemann et al., 1998, J. Geophys. Res. 103, 22831-22846; Atreya et al., 1999, Planet. Space Sci. 47, 1243-1262; Atreya et al., 2003, Planet. Space Sci. 51, 105-112) and the nitrogen isotopic ratio (Owen et al., 2001b, Astrophys. J. Lett. 553, L77-L79). The approximately three times solar abundance of NH <SUB>3</SUB> (along with CH <SUB>4</SUB> and H <SUB>2</SUB>S) is consistent with enrichment of Jupiter's atmosphere by icy planetesimals formed at temperatures &lt;40 K (Owen et al., 1999, Nature 402 (6759), 269-270), but would imply that H <SUB>2</SUB>O should be at least 3×solar as well. An alternate model, using clathrate hydrates to deliver the nitrogen component to Jupiter, predicts O/H⩾9×solar (Gautier et al., 2001, Astrophys. J. 550 (2), L227-L230). Finally we show that the measured condensible volatile vertical profiles in the PES are consistent with column-stretching or entraining downdraft scenarios only if the basic state (the pre-stretched column or the entrainment source region) is described by condensible volatile vertical profiles that are drier than those in the equilibrium cloud condensation models. This dryness is supported by numerous remote sensing results but seems to disagree with observations of widespread clouds on Jupiter at pressure levels predicted by equilibrium cloud condensation models for ammonia and H <SUB>2</SUB>S., Eleven dimensional supergravity compactified on T<SUP>10</SUP> admits classical solutions describing what is known as billiard cosmology — a dynamics expressible as an abstract (billiard) ball moving in the 10-dimensional root space of the infinite dimensional Lie algebra E<SUB>10</SUB>, occasionally bouncing off walls in that space. Unlike finite dimensional Lie algebras, E<SUB>10</SUB> has negative and zero norm roots, in addition to the positive norm roots. The walls above are related to physical fluxes that, in turn, are related to positive norm roots (called real roots) of E<SUB>10</SUB>. We propose that zero and negative norm roots, called imaginary roots, are related to physical branes. Adding ``matter'' to the billiard cosmology corresponds to adding potential terms associated to imaginary roots. The, as yet, mysterious relation between E<SUB>10</SUB> and M-theory on T<SUP>10</SUP> can now be expanded as follows: real roots correspond to fluxes or instantons, and imaginary roots correspond to particles and branes (in the cases we checked). Interactions between fluxes and branes and between branes and branes are classified according to the inner product of the corresponding roots (again in the cases we checked). We conclude with a discussion of an effective hamiltonian description that captures some features of M-theory on T<SUP>10</SUP>., In January 2006, the Stardust mission will return the first samples from a solid solar system body beyond the Moon and the first samples of contemporary interstellar dust ever collected. Although sophisticated laboratory instruments exist for the analysis of Stardust samples, techniques for the recovery of particles and particle residues from aerogel collectors remain primitive. Here, we describe our recent progress in developing techniques for extracting small volumes of aerogel, which we have called ""keystones,"" which completely contain particle impacts but minimize the damage to the surrounding aerogel collector. These keystones can be fixed to custom-designed micromachined silicon fixtures (so called ""microforklifts""). In this configuration, the samples are self-supporting, which can be advantageous in situations where interference from a supporting substrate is undesirable. The keystones may also be extracted and placed onto a substrate without a fixture. We have also demonstrated the capability of homologously crushing these unmounted keystones for analysis techniques that demand flat samples., The slow pulsar J0737-3039B in the double pulsar system eclipses the pulsed radio radiation from the fast pulsar J0737-3039A when B crosses the line of sight to A. In addition, over ∼ 90<SUP>o</SUP> of orbital phase, the pulsed radiation from B also shows a deep eclipse. Shock heated plasma of the A pulsar's wind enfolding B's magnetosphere in a magnetosheath is the geometrically most efficient model for these phenomena, with incoherent synchrotron absorption in the magnetosheath plasma being the obvious candidate for the mechanism behind the absorption of radio photons. However, when applied to the interpretation of the eclipses, the required density in the wind from A is approximately 5 orders of magnitude larger than is suggested by existing theories of pair creation applied to A's magnetopshere, and 3 orders of magnitude larger than would be expected, using an analogy to the particle injection rates inferred from young pulsar wind nebulae, which are powered by neutron stars with spindown luminosity much larger than that of pulsar A. <P />We suggest that pitch angle anisotropy and gyrophase coherence in the shocked pair plasma in the magnetosheath enhances the plasma's absorptivity for radio photons, thus reducing the inferred density required to create the observed eclipses. We use particle-in-cell simulations to show that the collisionless shock does create favorable conditions for this form of anomalous absorption to be operative. We show that the requisite gyrophase bunching enhances the synchrotron emission from B's magnetosheath to a level that offers a possible explanation of the unpulsed radio emission observed from this binary system. We also discuss some observational tests of our proposal., We present a new method for data weighting in waveform inversion to improve the obtained seismological earth model. We define `sensitivity' as an index to show the homogeneity of the waveform inversion data set. The sensitivity is directly evaluated from the partial derivatives of the synthetic seismograms and can be evaluated regardless of the method used to compute the synthetics. In this study we use the Direct Solution Method, which is a highly suitable method because of its accuracy and efficiency. If we weight the data so that the sensitivity is more or less homogeneous throughout the whole Earth, we can achieve homogeneous resolution for the entire region. The obtained model is an improvement over models obtained by previous inversion schemes, in the sense that the new model efficiently retrieves the robust information in the data. The inversion of a large data set using our methods can be expected to lead to further improvement of seismological earth models., Since the discovery of the cosmological origin of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), there has been growing interest in using these transient events to probe the quantum gravity energy scale in the range 10<SUP>16</SUP>-10<SUP>19</SUP> GeV, up to the Planck mass scale. This energy scale can manifest itself through a measurable modification in the electromagnetic radiation dispersion relation for high-energy photons originating from cosmological distances. We have used data from the GRB of 2002 December 6 (GRB 021206) to place an upper bound on the energy dispersion of the speed of light. The limit on the first-order quantum gravity effects derived from this single GRB indicates that the energy scale is in excess of 1.8×10<SUP>17</SUP> GeV. We discuss a program to further constrain the energy scale by systematically studying such GRBs., ACT, the next major step in gamma-ray astronomy, will probe the fires where chemical elements are formed through the systematic study of nuclear emission from supernova explosions with high spectral resolution. ACT requires two orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity over current gamma-ray observatories to achieve this goal. ACT will also enable new classes of black hole observations, including all-sky monitoring for transients, detailed spectra of the peak emission region near 1 MeV, high sensitivity to positron annihilation emission, and novel sensitivity to polarization. ACT was chosen by NASA for a 1-year Vision Mission concept study, with the primary goals of identifying the key technologies and developing the detailed mission concept. The technological advances enabling ACT are the development of 3-D position-sensitive detectors and corresponding read-out electronics. We will discuss the mission objectives, the goals of the concept study, and a technology roadmap to achieve the goals for ACT., The spatial distributions of dust around four late-type stars measured with the University of California, Berkeley, Infrared Spatial Interferometer (ISI) located at Mount Wilson, California, are described. Used as a heterodyne interferometer at 11.15 μm, the ISI was able to resolve the dust shells around late-type stars U Orionis, χ Cygni, W Aquilae, and IRC +10011 (CIT 3), including their inner radii. Models for dust distribution around these stars have been obtained by fitting the visibility data for both maximum and minimum luminosities and also available mid-infrared spectra of each star. Dust grains are modeled as a mixture of silicates and graphite, and since only two telescopes were used for these observations, the shells are assumed to be spherically symmetric. Visibility curves are shown to change with the luminosity phase of the star, with a larger fraction of the total 11 μm flux emitted from the dust near the star at the maximum than at the minimum phase. Mass-loss rates and estimates of the composition of the dust shell are provided for each star, and dust particle size is determined for IRC +10011 (CIT 3) by comparison of near- and mid-infrared visibilities., , A large number of polycrystalline materials, both manmade and natural, display preferred orientation of crystallites. Such alignment has a profound effect on anisotropy of physical properties. Preferred orientation or texture forms during growth or deformation and is modified during recrystallization or phase transformations and theories exist to predict its origin. Different methods are applied to characterize orientation patterns and determine the orientation distribution, most of them relying on diffraction. Conventionally x-ray pole-figure goniometers are used. More recently single orientation measurements are performed with electron microscopes, both SEM and TEM. For special applications, particularly texture analysis at non-ambient conditions, neutron diffraction and synchrotron x-rays have distinct advantages. The review emphasizes such new possibilities. <P />A second section surveys important texture types in a variety of materials with emphasis on technologically important systems and in rocks that contribute to anisotropy in the earth. In the former group are metals, structural ceramics and thin films. Seismic anisotropy is present in the crust (mainly due to phyllosilicate alignment), the upper mantle (olivine), the lower mantle (perovskite and magnesiowuestite) and the inner core (egr-iron) and due to alignment by plastic deformation. There is new interest in the texturing of biological materials such as bones and shells. Preferred orientation is not restricted to inorganic substances but is also present in polymers that are not discussed in this review., The variations in Mira's apparent size across the near- and mid-infrared are explained in terms of a single H<SUB>2</SUB>O shell surrounding the star. This simple model, consisting of a 2200 K H<SUB>2</SUB>O shell of column density 7×10<SUP>19</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> and radius 30.3 mas surrounding a 2700 K star of radius 12.8 mas, successfully reproduces a wide variety of interferometric and photometric observations that have been made near maximum phase., We present three methods for deriving the velocity field in magnetized regions of the Sun's photosphere. As a preliminary step, we introduce a Fourier-based local correlation tracking (LCT) routine that we term ``FLCT.'' By explicitly employing the observation made by Démoulin &amp; Berger, that results determined by LCT applied to magnetograms involve a combination of all components of the velocity and magnetic fields, we show that a three-component velocity field can be derived, in a method we term algebraic decomposition, or ADC. Finally, we introduce ILCT, a method that enforces consistency between the normal component of the induction equation and results obtained from LCT. When used with photospheric vector magnetograms, ILCT determines a three-component photospheric velocity field suitable for use with time sequences of such magnetograms to drive boundary conditions for MHD simulations of the solar corona. We present results from these methods applied to vector magnetograms of NOAA AR 8210 on 1998 May 1., We introduce a new computational method for embedding Lagrangian sink particles into a Eulerian calculation. Simulations of gravitational collapse or accretion generally produce regions whose density greatly exceeds the mean density in the simulation. These dense regions require extremely small time steps to maintain numerical stability. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) codes approach this problem by introducing nongaseous, accreting sink particles, and Eulerian codes may introduce fixed sink cells. However, until now there has been no approach that allows Eulerian codes to follow accretion onto multiple, moving objects. We have removed that limitation by extending the sink particle capability to Eulerian hydrodynamics codes. We have tested this new method and found that it produces excellent agreement with analytic solutions. In analyzing our sink particle method, we present a method for evaluating the disk viscosity parameter α due to the numerical viscosity of a hydrodynamics code and use it to compute α for our Cartesian adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code. We also present a simple application of this new method: studying the transition from Bondi to Bondi-Hoyle accretion that occurs when a shock hits a particle undergoing Bondi accretion., The proposed multi-band imaging of one of the most dynamic regions on Jupiter will complement recent space-based infrared datasets and will provide crucial constraints to models of Jovian atmospheric dynamics. NICMOS is sensitive to the jovian troposphere at and above the visible cloud decks. We selected six NICMOS filters with varying levels of atmospheric opacity to observe cloud features as they rotate from the central meridian to the limb, a strategy that will maximize the vertical resolution of our retrievals of cloud heights, haze opacity, and gaseous ammonia concentration. With these filters and the excellent NICMOS spatial resolution {nearly an order of magnitude improvement over Galileo NIMS images of the northern equatorial region}, we will determine the smaller-scale structure of fresh NH3 clouds and provide cloud heights as constraints for models of convection and dynamics associated with 5-micron hotspots. HST is essential for this project, since no other observatory can provide the necessary spatial resolution, and no ground-based or space-based telescopes can observe the ammonia bands we have selected., We propose to conduct a comprehensive high angular resolution study of the newly discovered debris disk around GJ 803. This nearby, young star has an estimated age of 8-20 Myr, a critical epoch in disk evolution and planet formation. By virtue of its proximity {10 pc} and nearly edge-on orientation, GJ 803's disk has an exceptional surface brightness and angular size relative to other disks resolved in scattered light thus far. Hence, this system offers an exciting new opportunity to study debris disks. Our proposed ACS and NICMOS imaging will elucidate the disk morphology, ascertain the grain properties as a function of radius, and search for fine dynamical structure indicative of the presence of planets. ACS WFC and NICMOS coronagraphic imaging will explore the inner disk, which includes the 17 AU inner disk hole inferred from the star's spectral energy distribution. Complementary ACS WFC imaging will probe the outer disk {&gt;70 AU}; at such large distances around GJ 803, dust evolutionary timescales are longer than the stellar age, and hence we can study the composition of primordial circumstellar material. The combined dataset will provide the most comprehensive study to date of a debris disk from 7 AU to 200 AU radius., This project is a 126-orbit imaging survey in F606W/F814W ACS to measure the evolution of galaxy disks from redshift z = 1.4 to the present. By combining HST imaging with existing observations in the Extended Groth Strip, we can for the first time simultaneously determine the mass in dark matter that underlies disks, the mass in stars within those disks, and the rate of formation of new stars from gas in the disks, for samples of &gt;1, 000 objects. ACS observations are critical for this work, both for reliable identifications of disks and for determining their sizes and inclinations. Combining these data with the kinematics measured from high-resolution Keck DEIMOS spectra will give dynamical masses that include dark matter. Stellar masses can be measured separately using ground-based BRIK and Spitzer IRAC GTO data, while cross-calibrated star formation rates will come from DEEP2 spectra, GALEX, and Spitzer/MIPS. The field chosen is the only one where all multiwavelength data needed will be available in the near term. These data will show how the fundamental properties of disks {luminosity, rotation speed, scale length} and their scaling relations have evolved since z 1, and also will measure the build-up of stellar disks directly, providing fundamental tests of disk formation and evolution. In addition to the above study of disk galaxies, the data will also be used to measure the evolution of red-sequence galaxies and their associated stellar populations. ACS images will yield the number of red-sequence galaxies versus time, together with their total associated stellar mass. ACS images are crucial to classify red-sequence galaxies into normal E/S0s versus peculiar types and to measure radii, which will complete the suite of fundamental structural parameters needed to study evolution. We will measure the zeropoints of major scaling laws {Fundamental Plane, radius versus sigma}, as well as evolution in characteristic quantities such as L*, v*, and r*. Stellar population ages will be estimated from high-resolution Keck DEIMOS spectra and compared to SED evolution measured from GALEX, HST, Spitzer, and ground-based colors. Important for both disk and red-galaxy programs are parallel exposures to be taken with both NIC3 {J and H} and WFPC2 {B}. These are arranged so that ACS, WFPC2, and NIC3 all overlap where possible , providing a rich data set of galaxies imaged with all three HST cameras from B to H. These data will be used to measure restframe visible morphologies and UV star-formation rates for galaxies near the edge of the survey, to discover and count EROs below the Keck spectroscopic limit of R = 24, and to provide an improved database of photometric redshifts for galaxies in the overlap regions., Studies of massive black holes (BHs) in nearby galactic centers have revealed a tight correlation between BH mass and galactic velocity dispersion. In this paper we investigate how the BH mass versus velocity dispersion relation and the nuclear luminosity versus velocity dispersion relation in QSOs/active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are connected with the BH mass versus velocity dispersion relation in local galaxies, through the nuclear luminosity evolution of individual QSOs/AGNs and the mass growth of individual BHs. In the study we ignore the effects of BH mergers and assume that the velocity dispersion does not change significantly during and after the nuclear activity phase. Using the observed correlation in local galaxies and an assumed form of the QSO/AGN luminosity evolution and BH growth, we obtain the simulated observational appearance of the BH mass versus velocity dispersion relation in QSOs/AGNs. The simulation results illustrate how the BH accretion history (e.g., the lifetime of nuclear activity and the possibility that QSOs/AGNs accrete at a super-Eddington accretion rate at the early evolutionary stage) can be inferred from the difference between the relation in QSOs/AGNs and that in local galaxies. We also show how the difference may be weakened by the flux limit of telescopes. We expect that a large complete sample of QSOs/AGNs with accurate BH mass and velocity dispersion measurements will help to quantitatively constrain QSO/AGN luminosity evolution and BH growth models., During 2001 and 2002, when the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) satellite had its apogee in the Northern Hemisphere and the Polar spacecraft, owing to the apsidal precession of its orbit, reached higher altitudes in the Southern Hemisphere, the two spacecraft offered a unique opportunity to study the aurora in the conjugate hemispheres simultaneously. Owing to the large fields of view of the Polar Visible Imaging System (VIS) Earth camera and the IMAGE-FUV instruments, substorms and auroral features were imaged on a global scale in both hemispheres. We have identified five substorm onsets and several auroral features that can be unambiguously identified and compared in the two hemispheres. When mapped onto apex coordinates in the two hemispheres, we find that substorm onset locations and auroral features are usually not symmetric. The longitudinal displacement in one hemisphere compared with the other can be as much as 1.5 hours of local time (~1500 km). For southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) the hemispherical asymmetry (ΔMLT) is strongly correlated with the IMF clock angle ($\theta$<SUB>C</SUB>) and a linear fit, ΔMLT = -0.017$\theta$<SUB>C</SUB> + 3.44, gives a correlation coefficient of 0.83 with a mean deviation of 0.4ΔMLT. These findings are interpreted as the magnetic tensions force acting on open magnetic field lines before reconnecting in the magnetotail. This can also be thought of as the IMF penetrating the magnetosphere., Experiments conducted on a dry and a water-saturated rock under Martian and Earth atmospheric pressures revealed two different wear behaviors in diamond-impregnated drill bits. When the rock was saturated, drilling under Martian pressure caused the water in contact with the rotating bit to vaporize. Since the volumetric expansion of the liquid water or ice as it turned into a vapor was 170,000, the continuous flow of water vapor cleared the cuttings out of the hole. Thus the bit matrix was always exposed to abrasive wear by the rock cuttings and was continually wearing down and exposing new diamonds to the rock. When the rock was dry, an accumulation of rock cuttings protected the matrix from abrasive wear. Since fresh diamonds were not exposed in a timely manner, the rate of penetration dropped. Both rock conditions, namely, dry or water saturated, may exist on Mars. This adds to the complexity of the drill bit design as, ideally, a bit should penetrate the rock irrespective of whether it is dry or water saturated. The ``fail-safe'' bit would have a very soft matrix to always produce some rock penetration at the expense of potential excessive bit wear and shallower than anticipated hole depth., To help determine the chemical composition of the Earth's mantle, we characterised the high-pressure mineral assemblage of an undepleted natural peridotite—thought to be representative of the Earth's upper-mantle—to 107 GPa using high-resolution X-ray diffraction. At lower-mantle conditions, the peridotite transforms to the assemblage 76 (±2)% (Mg <SUB>0.88</SUB>Fe <SUB>0.05</SUB><SUP>2+</SUP>Fe <SUB>0.01</SUB><SUP>3+</SUP>Al <SUB>0.12</SUB>Si <SUB>0.94</SUB>)O <SUB>3</SUB> orthorhombic perovskite by volume (at zero pressure), 17 (±2)% (Mg <SUB>0.80</SUB>Fe <SUB>0.20</SUB>)O magnesiowüstite and 7 (±1)% CaSiO <SUB>3</SUB> perovskite. The measured room-temperature bulk properties of this high-pressure assemblage, together with a range of estimates of thermal properties of the constituent minerals, appear to be inconsistent with seismological constraints on the density and bulk modulus of the lower mantle. Our results suggest that the lower mantle differs in bulk composition (e.g., richer in iron, Mg#∼0.85) from current estimates for the upper mantle, requiring some amount of segregation between the upper and lower mantle over geological history., Large sunspot areas correspond to dips in the total solar irradiance (TSI), a phenomenon associated with the local suppression of convective energy transport in the spot region. This results in a strong correlation between sunspot area and TSI. During the growth phase of a sunspot other physics may affect this correlation; if the physical growth of the sunspot resulted in surface flows affecting the temperature, for example, we might expect to see an anomalous variation in TSI. In this paper we study NOAA active region 8179, in which large sunspots suddenly appeared near disk center, at a time (March 1998) when few competing sunspots or plage regions were present on the visible hemisphere. We find that the area/TSI correlation does not significantly differ from the expected pattern of correlation, a result consistent with a large thermal conductivity in solar convection zone. In addition we have searched for a smaller-scale effect by analyzing white-light images from MDI (the Michelson Doppler Imager) on SOHO. A representative upper-limit energy consistent with the images is on the order of 3×10<SUP>31</SUP> ergs, assuming the time scale of the actual spot area growth. This is of the same order of magnitude as the buoyant energy of the spot emergence even if it is shallow. We suggest that detailed image analyses of sunspot growth may therefore show `transient bright rings' at a detectable level., We measure the two-point correlation function ξ(r<SUB>p</SUB>,π) in a sample of 2219 galaxies between z=0.7 and 1.35 to a magnitude limit of R<SUB>AB</SUB>=24.1 from the first season of the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey. From ξ(r<SUB>p</SUB>,π) we recover the real-space correlation function, ξ(r), which we find can be approximated within the errors by a power law, ξ(r)=(r/r<SUB>0</SUB>)<SUP>-γ</SUP>, on scales ~0.1-10 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc. In a sample with an effective redshift of z<SUB>eff</SUB>=0.82, for a ΛCDM cosmology we find r<SUB>0</SUB>=3.53+/-0.81 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc (comoving) and γ=1.66+/-0.12, while in a higher redshift sample with z<SUB>eff</SUB>=1.14 we find r<SUB>0</SUB>=3.12+/-0.72 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc and γ=1.66+/-0.12. These errors are estimated from mock galaxy catalogs and are dominated by the cosmic variance present in the current data sample. We find that red, absorption-dominated, passively evolving galaxies have a larger clustering scale length, r<SUB>0</SUB>, than blue, emission-line, actively star-forming galaxies. Intrinsically brighter galaxies also cluster more strongly than fainter galaxies at z~=1. Our results imply that the DEEP2 galaxies have an effective bias b=0.96+/-0.13 if σ<SUB>8DM</SUB>=1 today or b=1.19+/-0.16 if σ<SUB>8DM</SUB>=0.8 today. This bias is lower than that predicted by semianalytic simulations at z~=1, which may be the result of our R-band target selection. We discuss possible evolutionary effects within our survey volume, and we compare our results with galaxy-clustering studies at other redshifts, noting that our star-forming sample at z~=1 has selection criteria very similar to the Lyman break galaxies at z~=3 and that our red, absorption-line sample displays a clustering strength comparable to the expected clustering of the Lyman break galaxy descendants at z~=1. Our results demonstrate that galaxy-clustering properties as a function of color, spectral type, and luminosity seen in the local universe were largely in place by z~=1., Current plans to drill boreholes in the surface of Mars suppose that diamond drill bits will be used on drilling equipment developing drilling power of 100 W or less. Such drilling produces very fine cuttings. At Martian ambient pressure, it has been shown that quite small gas flows are capable of clearing these cuttings from the hole. For example, the release of 1 L of gas compressed to 50 torr is capable of removing 25 g of cuttings from a borehole 50 mm in diameter and at least 250 mm deep. Generating such volumes of gas by compressing the Martian atmosphere would not be difficult. Alternatively, the required volume of gas could be provided by the sublimation of ice trapped in the pore spaces of soil or rock in the Martian surface. Once heated by the friction of the drill bit, the ice transforms into vapor, and blows the cuttings out of the hole. Since the cuttings are, in effect, freeze-dried, they do not choke the drill bit or hole, with the result that the drilling efficiency is much greater than under terrestrial pressures and temperatures., We review observations of the physical properties of the diffuse ISM HI components, namely the Cold and Warm Neutral Media (CNM and WNM). There is somewhat more WNM than CNM, and at least half of the WNM is not thermally stable. The CNM has typical turbulent Mach number 3. Magnetic fields in the CNM are not as large as expected from the classical flux-freezing argument; neither are magnetic fields always strong enough for the Alfven velocity to equal the turbulent velocity. Nevertheless, they are usually strong enough to put CNM clouds in the magnetically subcritical regime. We identify a probable new source of turbulence for the diffuse ISM. We discuss one very cold cloud that has considerable internal turbulence and, because of its extreme thinness ∼0.05 pc, a turbulent crossing time of only ∼5 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> yr., We study whether gravitational scattering of halo dark matter particles by subhalos can connect two seemingly independent problems: the abundance of subhalos in dark matter halos and the cuspiness of the halos' inner density profiles. Our numerical experiments indicate that subhalos can cause the collisionless dark matter particles in the centers of main halos to diffuse. Combined with tidal mass loss of the subhalos, this process introduces significant scatter in the inner density profiles and offers an explanation for the range of profiles seen in both observations and cosmological simulations., Type Ia supernovae {SNe Ia} are very important to many diverse areas of astrophysics, from the chemical evolution of galaxies to observational cosmology which led to the discovery of dark energy and the accelerating Universe. However, the utility of SNe Ia as cosmological probes depends on the degree of our understanding of SN Ia physics, and various systematic effects such as cosmic chemical evolution. At present, the progenitors of SNe Ia and the exact explosion mechanisms are still poorly understood, as are evolutionary effects on SN Ia peak luminosities. Since early-time UV spectra and light curves of nearby SNe Ia can directly address these questions, we propose an approach consisting of two observational components: {1} Detailed studies of two very bright, young, nearby SNe Ia with HST UV spectroscopy at 13 epochs within the first 1.5 months after discovery; and {2} studies of correlations with luminosity for five somewhat more distant Hubble-flow SNe Ia, for which relative luminosities can be determined with precision, using 8 epochs of HST UV spectroscopy and/or broad-band imaging. The HST data, along with extensive ground-based optical to near-IR observations, will be analyzed with state-of-the-art models to probe SN Ia explosion physics and constrain the nature of the progenitors. The results will form the basis for the next phase of precision cosmology measurements using SNe Ia, allowing us to more fully capitalize on the substantial past {and future} investments of time made with HST in observations of high-redshift SNe Ia., We report the unexpected detection of the Fomalhaut debris disk in scattered light during one orbit of observation for our Cycle 12 program GO9862. This is a major discovery because Fomalhaut is now the closest {7.7 pc} and oldest { 200 Myr} debris disk detected in reflected light. We would like to request Director's Discretionary Time to further study the Fomalhaut disk. The goals are to image the disk around its entire perimeter, increase the signal-to-noise of the detection, and to obtain data at a second wavelength. We will perform a high-resolution study of radial and azimuthal disk asymmetries that are thought to arise from perturbations by planet-mass companions, and we will constrain the physical properties of grain material by obtaining the color of the disk. Because our original Cycle 12 program was designed to study point sources in the field, and the ACS/HRC coronagraph is a limited lifetime resource, it is necessary to acquire these additional data via Director's Discretionary Time during Cycle 13. The observational challenge of high contrast cannot be met by other observatories, and these data will complement new Spitzer results on the Fomalhaut disk at mid and far-infared wavelengths., During the past few years, robotic {or nearly robotic} searches for supernovae {SNe}, most notably our Lick Observatory Supernova Search {LOSS}, have found hundreds of SNe, many of them in quite nearby galaxies {cz &lt; 4000 km/s}. Most of the objects were discovered before maximum brightness, and have follow-up photometry and spectroscopy; they include some of the best-studied SNe to date. We propose to conduct a snapshot imaging survey of the sites of some of these nearby objects, to obtain late-time photometry that {through the shape of the light and color curves} will help reveal the origin of their lingering energy. The images will also provide high-resolution information on the local environment of SNe that are far superior to what we can procure from the ground. For example, we will obtain color-color and color-magnitude diagrams of stars in these SN sites, to determine their progenitor masses and constraints on the reddening. Recovery of the SNe in the new HST images will also allow us to actually pinpoint their progenitor stars in cases where pre-explosion images exist in the HST archive. Use of ACS rather than WFPC2 will make our snapshot survey even more valuable than our Cycle 9 survey. This Proposal is complementary to our Cycle 13 archival proposal, in which we outline a plan for using existing HST images to glean information about SN environments., We present chromospheric Ca II H and K activity measurements, rotation periods, and ages for ~1200 F, G, K, and M type main-sequence stars from ~18,000 archival spectra taken at Keck and Lick Observatories as a part of the California and Carnegie Planet Search Project. We have calibrated our chromospheric S-values against the Mount Wilson chromospheric activity data. From these measurements we have calculated median activity levels and derived R<SUP>'</SUP><SUB>HK</SUB>, stellar ages, and rotation periods from general parameterizations for 1228 stars, ~1000 of which have no previously published S-values. We also present precise time series of activity measurements for these stars. <P />Based on observations obtained at Lick Observatory, which is operated by the University of California, and on observations obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated jointly by the University of California and the California Institute of Technology. The Keck Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation., We compressed and analyzed an undepleted natural peridotite—thought to be representative of the Earth's upper mantle—from ∼25 to 110 GPa and heated to 2000-2500 K. Scatter in zero-pressure unit-cell volumes observed for high-pressure phases synthesized from peridotite, of ±0.4% for orthorhombic perovskite and ±0.8% for magnesiowüstite, can be ascribed to compositional heterogeneity in the natural starting material and its transformation products (calcium perovskite was also observed at high pressures, but does not quench to zero pressure). The scatter is larger than the measurement uncertainties, which are as little as ±0.1%, but is less than would be expected from the variation in composition among distinct minerals if the starting material had failed to equilibrate upon transformation to the high-pressure assemblage (e.g., up to ±0.6-0.8% in volume for orthorhombic perovskite). The equilibrium unit-cell volume of orthorhombic perovskite calculated from an average of electron microprobe analyses on the quenched samples, 163.3 (±0.6) Å <SUP>3</SUP>, agrees to within 0.4% with the average value measured from the same samples by X-ray diffraction at zero pressure (163.9±0.7 Å <SUP>3</SUP>). Similarly, values of zero-pressure density for the whole-rock assemblage of high-pressure phases are identical (4.13±0.03 g/cm <SUP>3</SUP>), whether derived from electron microprobe or X-ray diffraction measurements., One of the enduring puzzles in the formation of planetary systems is how millimeter-sized dust grains agglomerate to become kilometer-sized, self gravitating planetesimals, the ``building blocks'' of planets. One theory is that the dust grains settle into the mid-plane of the protoplanetary disk (thin, cool disk of gas and dust in orbit around a newly forming protostar) until they reach a critical density that triggers a gravitational instability to clumping. However, turbulence within the disk is likely to stir up the dust grains and prevent them from reaching this critical density. A competing theory is that dust grains grow by pair-wise collisions, forming fractal structures. It is unclear, however, how robust such structures would be to successive collisions. A new and exciting theory is that vortices in a protoplanetary disk may capture dust grains at their centers, ``seeding'' the formation of planetesimals. We are investigating the dynamics of 3D vortices in protoplanetary disks with a parallel spectral code on the Blue Horizon supercomputer. Some of the lingering questions we address are: What is the structure of 3D vortices in a protoplanetary disk? Are they columns that extend vertically through the disk, through many scale heights of pressure and density? Or are they more ``pancake-like'' and confined to the mid-plane? Are the vortices stable to small perturbations, such as vertical shear? Are 3D vortices robust and long-lived coherent structures? Do small vortices merge to form larger vortices the way vortices on Jupiter do?, We have developed a single-inlet pulse tube refrigerator and clearance-seal compressor which deliver approximately 0.4 W cooling at 80 K for a new radio telescope, the Allen Telescope Array. The array requires approximately 350 refrigerators (one for each antenna), so extremely high reliability and low cost are essential. The refrigerator has a U configuration and is optimized for 60 Hz operation. Two versions, with slightly different pulse tube geometry, have been built and tested to compare the losses associated with the non-adiabatic behavior of the pulse tube. The compressor consists of a single oscillating piston driven by a linear motor. It has a simple design, a very low parts count (which is nearly halved by accepting an unbalanced design), and is optimized for mass production. Due to tight packaging constraints within the antenna feed, the compressor must be separated from the refrigerator. The refrigerator performance is still being optimized, with about 1 W of cooling at 80 K expected for 40 W electrical input power. The system design and refrigerator design and construction were done at NIST, while the compressor was designed and built at U. C. Berkeley., We present a 200 ksec observation of the High Mass X-ray Binary GX 301-2 taken in 2000 November with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer during the pre-periastron flare and the actual periastron passage of the neutron star. To model the spectrum we use a power law with the Fermi Dirac cutoff and a cyclotron line at higher energies plus either a reflection component or a heavily absorbed partial covering component. Although completely different, both models describe the data equally well. Phase resolved spectra show that the energy and the depth of the cyclotron resonant scattering feature vary strongly with pulse phase: It is deepest in the fall of the main pulse, the rise of the secondary pulse, and the pulse minimum in-between with τ<SUB>C</SUB>~0.3. In the other phase bins the line is much less deep with τ<SUB>C</SUB>~0.1. The energy of the line correlates strongly with its depth and varies by 25 % from 30.1 keV in the fall of the secondary pulse to 37.9 keV in the fall of the main pulse., The density jump (Δρ<SUB>ICB</SUB>) at the inner core boundary (ICB) is an important constraint on the dynamics and history of the Earth's core. Two types of seismological data sensitive to Δρ<SUB>ICB</SUB> have been studied since the 1970s: free oscillation eigenfrequencies and the amplitudes of core reflected phases (PKiKP/PcP). The preliminary reference earth model (PREM) of Dziewonski &amp; Anderson, based largely on normal mode data, has a relatively low value of Δρ<SUB>ICB</SUB>= 0.60 g cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, whereas most studies based on PKiKP/PcP amplitude ratios find significantly larger values, sometimes in excess of 1.0 g cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. It has been argued that, because PKiKP is rarely observed in the distance range considered (10-70°), the latter type of measurement provides only upper bounds on Δρ<SUB>ICB</SUB>. We have analysed 10 yr of high-quality global broad-band data accumulated since the work of Shearer &amp; Masters. We systematically analysed over 4500 seismograms from intermediate/deep events (depth &gt;70 km) and nuclear explosions in the distance range 10-70°. The data were filtered in the bandpass 0.7-3 Hz. We performed rigorous data selection and identified five pairs of very clear (quality A), and 15 possible (quality A<SUP>-</SUP>) PKiKP and PcP arrivals. In addition, 58 records showed no PKiKP but a clear PcP. Together, we obtain a much less dispersed data set than previously available, with the quality A data at the lower end of the ensemble of amplitude ratios versus distance. We combine our high-quality measurements with two measurements from the literature that fall within our rigorous selection criteria and obtain estimates of Δρ<SUB>ICB</SUB> in the range 0.6-0.9 g cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and Δβ<SUB>ICB</SUB> in the range 2-3 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Our estimate of Δρ<SUB>ICB</SUB> is in agreement with a recent re-evaluation of normal mode data, thus reconciling results from body wave and mode studies and providing a tighter constraint on Δρ<SUB>ICB</SUB> for geodynamicists. Our study also provides evidence for a shear velocity gradient at the top of the inner core., Recent advances in basic microchannel plate detector technology include new photocathodes such as diamond and GaN with high UV efficiency (up to &gt;50%), silicon-based microchannel plates with low fixed pattern noise and background event rates less than 0.02eventscm<SUP>-2</SUP>s<SUP>-1</SUP>. In combination with cross-strip photon counting readouts with spatial resolutions of &lt;5μm at low gain (4×10<SUP>5</SUP>) these advances offer considerable performance improvements in future astronomical instruments., We present a set of mock redshift catalogs, constructed from N-body simulations, designed to mimic the DEEP2 survey. Galaxies with a range of luminosities are placed within virialized halos in the simulation using a variant of the halo model. The halo model parameters are chosen to reproduce local clustering and abundance data and are assumed to be independent of redshift. This allows us to predict the luminosity function, two-point correlation function, luminosity- and scale-dependent bias, redshift space distortions, and so on, of our galaxies at higher redshifts. We show that the low-order clustering properties are consistent with preliminary DEEP2 data. The catalogs can be used to evaluate the selection effects of the survey and to test new algorithms and statistics that are to be used in the analysis of DEEP2 data., A dynamical non-Euclidean spacetime geometry in general relativity theory implies the possibility of gravitational radiation. Here we explore novel methods of detecting such radiation from astrophysical sources by means of matter-wave interferometers (MIGOs), using atomic beams emanating from supersonic atomic sources that are further cooled and collimated by means of optical molasses. While the sensitivities of such MIGOs compare favorably with LIGO and LISA, the sizes of MIGOs can be orders of magnitude smaller, and their bandwidths wider. Using a pedagogical approach, we place this problem into the broader context of problems at the intersection of quantum mechanics with general relativity., We consider models where the scale of supersymmetry breaking lies between 5×10<SUP>6</SUP> and 5×10<SUP>8</SUP> GeV. In this class of theories, which includes models of mediated supersymmetry breaking, the lightest supersymmetric particle is the gravitino, and the next to lightest is typically a long-lived charged slepton with a lifetime between a microsecond and a second, depending on its mass. We investigate the production of these particles by the diffuse flux of high energy neutrinos colliding with nucleons in the Earth, and the potential for their observation in large ice or water Cerenkov detectors. The small production cross section is partially compensated by the very long range of sleptons. The signal, two well-separated parallel tracks, has very little background. Using the Waxman-Bahcall limit for the neutrino flux results in up to four events a year in km<SUP>3</SUP> experiments., The light curves of the pre-main-sequence star KH 15D from the years 1913-2003 can be understood if the star is a member of an eccentric binary that is encircled by a vertically thin, inclined ring of dusty gas. Eclipses occur whenever the reflex motion of a star carries it behind the circumbinary ring; the eclipses occur with a period equal to the binary orbital period of 48.4 days. Features of the light curve, including the amplitude of central reversals during mid-eclipse, the phase of the eclipse with respect to the binary orbit phase, the level of brightness out of eclipse, the depth of the eclipse, and the eclipse duty cycle, are all modulated on the timescale of nodal regression of the obscuring ring, in accord with the historical data. The ring has a mean radius near 3 AU and a radial width that is likely less than this value. While the inner boundary could be shepherded by the central binary, the outer boundary may require an exterior planet to confine it against viscous spreading. The ring must be vertically warped to maintain a nonzero inclination. Thermal pressure gradients and/or ring self-gravity can readily enforce rigid precession. In coming years, as the node of the ring regresses out of our line of sight toward the binary, the light curve from the system should cycle approximately back through its previous behavior. Near-term observations should seek to detect a mid-infrared excess from this system; we estimate the flux densities from the ring to be 3 mJy at wavelengths of 10-100 μm., Space weather is driven by solar processes that create a dynamic solar wind which, in turn, can interact with Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere. Sharing the science of these processes, such as coronal mass ejections, with the public at large is a challenge. We have met that challenge by forming collaborations between musicians, programmers, and scientists to map data to music as a way to make solar wind data more accessible to the general public. The music produced can then be shared with the public via web pages, concerts, or even museum kiosks. We will present our work on converting solar wind particle and electric fields data to music. Our presentation will emphasize both the challenges and successes we have encountered during this project and our goals for how to use it in the future. We would like to thank NASA STEREO (SWAVES and IMPACT teams) for funding this project., Solar photospheric magnetic field variations around the Oct. 28th and 29th, 2003 large flares and CMEs are investigated. The essential data for the study are the high cadence MDI full disk line of sight magnetograms. Abrupt and permanent changes of the field strength occur at the times of both X-flares (Oct. 28, ~10:30UT and Oct. 29, 20:45UT). GONG+ magnetograms are used to provide a possible confirmation of the observed field changes. Velocity fields in the CME related active region and their evolution around the time of the events are obtained using the Local Correlation Tracking (LCT) technique on the MDI magnetograms. Some Mees/IVM vector magnetic field data analysis results may also likely be available.This level of observation of major active region fields spawning superstorm conditions is unprecedented., The October 28, 11 UT X-17 flare produced an impulsive electron event detected near the Earth by the WIND 3D Plasma &amp; Energetic Particles instrument from ~200 keV down to ~1~keV, even though the flare was located around E08 and therefore unlikely to be magnetically connected to Earth. This impulsive event exhibited a fast rise and decay (~10 min each), and was followed by a second, much slower rising event that lasted for many hours. The peak times of the impulsive event show clear velocity dispersion consistent with a path length of 1.27±0.1 AU, indicating that the electron propagation is essentially scatter-free. Onset time analysis reveal that the impulsive event electrons left the Sun at 11:14±3 UT, just after the end of a group of type III bursts seen at 14~MHz (11:03-11:11~UT) and when the type II burst reaches 14~MHz. Radio pulsations at 0.6-1.3~GHz were seen between 11:14:30 and 11:22:00~UT. The velocity dispersion seen in the peak times suggests that the peak of the injection occurred around 11:25±3~UT roughly consistent with the end of the decimeter radio emission. This impulsive electron event also was observed near Mars at energies from ~1 to 20~keV by the Electron Reflectometer instrument on Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft., Dynamical instabilities in planetary systems with multiple giant planets can lead to planets undergoing close encounters and ultimately being ejected from the planetary system. Before a planet is ejected, it typically goes through an extended period of time during which the planet's apocenter is raised to large radial distances. During this stage, the planet passes through the outer regions of the planetary system. Since the timescales for planet formation increase with radial distance, only small solid bodies form in the outer regions of the planetary system. A highly eccentric giant planet with large apocenter distance can excite eccentricities and clear out regions of this outer disk. Additionally, a massive outer disk may affect the orbit of the planet. We will present results of direct numerical simulations of highly eccentric giant planets interacting with an outer planetesimal disk. <P />E.B.F. acknowledges the support of the Miller Institute for Basic Research and the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics. This research was supported in part by the Miller Institute for Basic Research, the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, and the National Science Foundation under Grant No. PHY99-07949., Imaging of gamma-ray line emission from solar flares provides direct information on the spatial characteristics of accelerated ions near the Sun. To date this has been possible for only one event (July 23, 2002) whose neutron-capture line image at 2.2 MeV implied a significant spatial difference between high energy ions and electrons in acceleration and/or transport. <P />Observations of the X17, X10 and X8 events on October 28, October 29 and November 2, 2003 by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) provided a ten-fold increase in the detected nuclear-line photons available for imaging. This paper presents the results of imaging of these flares in the 2.2 MeV neutron capture line, including source size, location and motion estimates and comparisons with simultaneous gamma-ray and x-ray emission in the electron-bremsstrahlung continuum. <P />This work is supported by NASA contract NAS5-98033., The Sun is the most energetic particle accelerator in the solar system, producing ions up to tens of GeV and electrons to hundreds of MeV in solar flares and fast Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). Solar flares are the most powerful explosions, releasing up to 10^3^2^-^3^3 ergs in 10-1000s. The accelerated ∼10-100 keV electrons and &gt; ∼1 MeV ions often contain the bulk of this energy, indicating that the particle acceleration and energy release processes are intimately linked. The Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) mission (launched February 2002) provides the first high-resolution imaging (to ∼2 arcsec) and spectroscopy ( ∼ keV FWHM) of solar hard X-ray/gamma-ray continuum and gamma-ray lines, emitted by the flare-accelerated electrons and ions in bremsstrahlung and nuclear collisions with the solar atmosphere, respectively. In the 23 July 2002 flare, RHESSI resolved the narrow prompt de-excitation gamma-ray lines of Fe, Mg, Si, Ne, C, and O, for the first time. Mass-dependent red shifts of 0.1-0.8 % were measured, implying downward motion of the parent accelerated protons and alphas along magnetic field lines that are tilted toward the Earth by ∼40^o. RHESSI located the flare-accelerated ions for the first time through imaging of the 2.223 MeV neutron-capture gamma-ray line, showing that the ions interact near the optical flare. The centroid of this line emission is located 20+-6 arcsec from the centroids for the 0.3-0.5 and 0.7-1.4 MeV bands that are dominated by electron bremsstrahlung, indicating that the acceleration and/or propagation of the ions must differ from that of the electrons. Information on the spectrum and composition of the accelerated ions was also obtained from the narrow and broad gamma-ray lines. The implications for our present understanding of the particle acceleration and energy release processes in flares will be discussed., Earth's Moon, lacking both a global magnetic field and any significant atmosphere, presents an ideal location to study plasma flow past a solar system body in one of its simplest incarnations. Despite its relative simplicity, however, the lunar plasma wake interaction displays a rich array of interesting physics, with aspects of both fluid and kinetic behavior that may also prove relevant to smaller obstacles (such as asteroids) or those with more significant magnetic fields. We present a new study of the solar wind interaction with the Moon, using data from the Lunar Prospector (LP) spacecraft to characterize the plasma environment very near the Moon. We utilize magnetometer and electrostatic analyzer measurements from 3813 LP orbits to determine the local magnetic field and electrostatic potential with unprecedented resolution at altitudes of 15-120 km. This exceptionally large data set allows us to examine the low-altitude lunar wake in detail, including its variation with altitude and its symmetry properties. By using WIND to monitor the ambient solar wind (shifting the data appropriately to take into account the separation between WIND and LP), we can also sort LP data by solar wind magnetic field, density, temperature, velocity, etc. to determine how the lunar wake responds to varying plasma conditions and magnetic field orientations. At 80-120 km above the Moon, we observe a ""classical"" lunar wake signature, with enhanced magnetic fields in the central wake (ensuring pressure balance) and reduced fields near the wake boundary due to diamagnetic currents, together with an ambipolar potential drop across the wake boundary (resulting in central wake potentials 300-400 V negative relative to the solar wind). On some orbits, we also see large magnetic field perturbations (""limb shocks"") caused by interactions with crustal magnetic sources near the limb. At lower altitudes, we see a gradual transition from this classical magnetic signature to a more disordered signature, which is influenced more directly by local crustal fields. The observed wake signature at higher altitudes responds clearly to changes in solar wind parameters, while that at lower altitudes is again more disordered and depends more obviously on local crustal fields than solar wind conditions., Geosciences at the Galilean Moons With the Multiple Instrument Distributed Aperture Sensor (MIDAS) The Voyager and Galileo missions have revealed the Galilean Icy Moons and Io to be dynamic worlds, possessing possible subsurface oceans, magnetism, spectacular volcanic activity, and potentially extinct or extant life. While our knowledge of the Galilean moons has indeed been revolutionized by the missions conducted to date, modest spectral and spatial resolution data sets achieved on Galileo due to high gain antenna problems, difficulties in coordinated instrument operations, and inherent instrument design limits leave many unanswered questions: What is the state and distribution of ice and liquid water on Europa? What processes control the distribution and composition of the non-icy material on the surface? What is the extent of tectonic and volcanic activity? These and other questions have an important bearing not only on our knowledge of the geology and origin of these moons, but are also highly relevant to an assessment of their past or present habitability. A limited number of flybys have yielded km-scale and some m-scale images that provide some context for these and other questions, but it is unlikely we will be able to apply all of these lessons learned to the numerous features that are almost certain to exist at or below the current detection limits. To advance our understanding of these moons to the next step, global coverage at spatial scales ranging from ~cm to m combined with simultaneous spectral measurements with ~nm precision over long timescales are required. Here we describe how these science objectives can be fulfilled on the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO) mission by the Multiple Instrument Distributed Aperture Sensor (MIDAS). MIDAS is a unique distributed aperture imaging spectrometer capable of high spectral and spatial resolutions using less mass, volume, and power than systems with similar capabilities, and is compatible with the Prometheus-class mission design intended for JIMO. With spectral resolution of ~1 nm, MIDAS combines high resolution imagery with detailed classification of minerals, volatiles, and organics in the same field of view. Science observations from low orbit (100km) can measure features down to ~cm scales, such as crack movements on Europa from possible tectonic activity as well as future potential landing sites. At higher orbits and during transfer trajectories the wide field of regard of MIDAS enables global imaging of icy moon surfaces; in the case of Europa, this could be done with sufficient resolution to measure the tidal bulge. Additional science objectives can be met for Io as well, the entire surface of which could be imaged at ~50m/pixel by MIDAS from the orbit of Europa. MIDAS also supports active sounding techniques using laser altimetry, vibrometry, or ablative spectroscopy. Combined with radar, active sounding, and gravity measurements, MIDAS will round out a complete remote sensing package and enable many of the science objectives for JIMO to be accomplished within the current mission timeline., We are using lunar glass spherules to measure changes in the meteoroid bombardment of the inner solar system through the last four billion years. Spherules, which range in size up to a few hundred microns in diameter, are formed in meteoroid impacts and volcanic fire-fountaining events on the surface of the Moon. The ages of formation of the impact spherules, which we determine using the <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/<SUP>39</SUP>Ar isochron technique, record the timing of the impacts that produced them. The distribution of 155 ages of spherules taken from Apollo 14 soil sample 14163 (which we reported in 2000 in Science 287, 1785) showed a gradually decreasing abundance of spherules formed from 3.0 to 0.4 Ga as the solar system matured, and then a surprising fourfold jump in spherule production in the last 400 Myr. We now seek to learn whether the recent increase in spherule production is due to increased meteoroid bombardment since that time, an increase in the efficiency of spherule creation in impacts, or a change in preservation conditions at the Apollo 14 landing site. To determine whether the abundance of young spherules truly implies a Solar System-scale phenomenon, we are repeating the experiment with samples from a different location on the Moon. We have selected 178 spherules from Apollo 12 soil 12023 which, like 14163, was taken from the ejecta of a recent bedrock-penetrating impact, and therefore should offer a representative selection of spherules from various depths in the regolith. These spherules are each larger than 180 microns in diameter, and, because precision of our age measurements is limited by the scarcity of K, the larger size of these spherules relative to those in our previous study should compensate for the somewhat lower K content of Apollo 12 soils. Chemical compositions, which we measured using energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry, imply that nearly all the Apollo 12 spherules were produced in impacts rather than in volcanic eruptions. Impact origin is indicated by Fe-Ni surface grains, chemical heterogeneity, and low Mg/Al ratios. Radioisotopic age measurements on the spherules are now under way. If the Apollo 12 measurements confirm our earlier observation that the meteoroid bombardment has been four times higher over the last 400 Myr than previously, we shall need to consider where a new population of impactors could have come from, how long such epochs of high meteoroid flux last, and how significant such periods might be for the evolution of life on Earth., The October 28, 11 UT X-17 flare produced an impulsive electron event detected near the Earth by the WIND 3D Plasma &amp; Energetic Particles instrument from ∼200 keV down to ∼1 keV, even though the flare was located around E08 and therefore unlikely to be magnetically connected to Earth. This impulsive event exhibited a fast rise and decay ( ∼10 min each), and was followed by a second, much slower rising event that lasted for many hours. The peak times of the impulsive event show clear velocity dispersion consistent with a path length of 1.27±0.1 AU, indicating that the electron propagation is essentially scatter-free. Onset time analysis reveal that the impulsive event electrons left the Sun at 11:14±3 UT, just after the end of a group of type III bursts seen at 14 MHz (11:03-11:11 UT) and when the type II burst reaches 14 MHz. Radio pulsations at 0.6-1.3 GHz were seen between 11:14:30 and 11:22:00 UT. The velocity dispersion seen in the peak times suggests that the peak of the injection occurred around 11:25±3 UT roughly consistent with the end of the decimeter radio emission. This impulsive electron event also was observed near Mars at energies from ∼1 to 20 keV by the Electron Reflectometer instrument on Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft., We present a degree-8 3-D Q model (QRLW8) of the upper mantle, derived from three-component surface waveform data in the period range 60-400 s. The inversion procedure involves two steps. In the first step, 3-D whole-mantle velocity models are derived separately for elastic SH (transverse component) and SV (vertical and longitudinal component) velocity models, using both surface and body waveforms and the non-linear asymptotic coupling theory (NACT) approach. In the second step, the surface waveforms thus aligned in phase are inverted to obtain a 3-D Q model in the depth range 80-670 km. Various stability tests are performed to assess the quality of the resulting Q model and, in particular, to assess possible contamination from focusing effects. We find that the 3-D patterns obtained are stable, but the amplitude of the lateral variations in Q is not well constrained, because large damping is necessary to extract the weak Q signal from data. The model obtained agrees with previous results in that a strong correlation of Q with tectonics is observed in the first 250 km of the upper mantle, with high attenuation under oceanic regions and low attenuation under continental shields. It is gradually replaced by a simpler pattern at larger depth. At the depths below 400 km, the Q distribution is generally dominated by two strong minima, one under the southern Pacific and one under Africa, yielding a strong degree-2 pattern. Most hotspots are located above regions of low Q at this depth. Ridges are shallow features in both velocity and Q models., We demonstrate through the use of a simple toy model that asphericity in dark matter halos has a measurable effect on the configuration dependence of the weak-lensing shear three-point function at small scales. In principle, this sensitivity provides a way to measure the shapes of dark matter halos. The distribution of halo ellipticities should be included in models aiming at a high-fidelity prediction of n-point shear correlation statistics., We estimate the effects of low temporal frequency modes in the time stream on sky maps such as expected from the PLANCK experiment - a satellite mission designed to image the sky in the microwave band. We perform the computations in a semi-analytic way based on a simple model of PLANCK observations, which permits an insight into the structure of noise correlations of PLANCK-like maps, without doing exact, computationally intensive numerical calculations. We show that, for a set of plausible scanning strategies, marginalization over temporal frequency modes with frequencies lower than the spin frequency of the satellite (≃ 1/60 Hz) causes a nearly negligible deterioration of a quality of the resulting sky maps. We point out that this observation implies that it should be possible to successfully remove effects of long-term time domain parasitic signals from the PLANCK/ maps during the data analysis stage. <P />Appendix A is only available in electronic form at http://www.edpsciences.org, We report here the discovery of a significant source of systematic error in the determinations of pulsar rotation measures. Conventional analysis of high-sensitivity polarimetric observations of PSR B2016+28 display variation in the rotation measure of +/-15 rad m<SUP>-2</SUP> (around the mean value of -34.6 rad m<SUP>-2</SUP>) across the pulse profile. Analysis of single pulse data shows that this variation is an artifact of the incoherent superposition of quasi-orthogonal polarization modes along with the frequency dependence of relative strength and/or quasi-orthogonality of the modes. Quasi-orthogonal polarization is common among pulsars, and therefore this effect needs to be taken into account in the interpretation of pulsar rotation measures., We use a three dimensional model of scattered light from an optically thin dust disk to constrain the orientation and structure of the AU Mic debris disk (Kalas et al. 2004). Fits to the projected midplane surface brightness between 60 and 160 AU radius correspond to a dust volume number density that varies radially as a power-law with index=-2.6. We also discuss the vertical disk profile, show possible evidence for asymmetry, and compare AU Mic's overall disk structure to that of beta Pic. The observed 6<SUP>o</SUP> wing-tilt between AU Mic's midplanes can be explained if the grain scattering phase function is non-isotropic and the disk is inclined to the line of sight. However, the sharpness of the midplane isophotes indicates that the disk is oriented no greater than 5<SUP>o</SUP> away from edge-on. AU Mic is therefore an excellent candidate for extrasolar planet detection via the transit method. <P />This work is supported by the NASA Origins Program (NAG5-11769) and the NSF Center for Adaptive Optics (AST-987683)., We report the nondetection of the [C II] (<SUP>2</SUP>P<SUB>3/2</SUB>--&gt;<SUP>2</SUP>P<SUB>1/2</SUB>) 157.74 μm transition in the z=6.42 quasar SDSS J1148+5251 after 37.5 hr of integration with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. This transition is the main cooling line of the star-forming interstellar medium and usually the brightest far-infrared (FIR) line in galaxies. Our observed 1 σ rms=1.3 mK in the T<SUP>*</SUP><SUB>A</SUB> scale translates to L<SUB>[CII]</SUB>&lt;2.6×10<SUP>9</SUP> L<SUB>solar</SUB>. Using a recent estimate of the FIR continuum of this quasar, we derive for SDSS J1148+5251 L<SUB>[CII]</SUB>/L<SUB>FIR</SUB>&lt;5×10<SUP>-4</SUP>, a ratio similar to that observed in local ultraluminous infrared galaxies but considerably smaller than what is typical in nearby normal and starburst galaxies. This indicates that the small L<SUB>[CII]</SUB>/L<SUB>FIR</SUB> ratio observed locally in luminous FIR objects also persists at the highest redshifts., The measured distances of Type Ia (hydrogen-deficient) supernovae (SNe) as a function of redshift (z) have shown that the expansion of the Universe is currently accelerating, probably due to the presence of repulsive ""dark energy"" (X) such as Einstein's cosmological constant (Lambda). Combining the high-z data with existing results from large-scale structure surveys, a best fit for Omega<SUB>M</SUB> and Omega<SUB>X</SUB> of 0.28 and 0.72 (respectively) is found, in excellent agreement with the values (0.27 and 0.73) derived from the first year of WMAP measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation. Most recently, analyses of SNe at z = 1.0-1.7 provide evidence for an early era of deceleration. Several groups are now in the process of measuring hundreds of SNe at z = 0.2-0.8, to determine the equation of state of the dark energy, w<SUB>X</SUB> = P/(ρ c^2). Thus far, the best-fit value is w<SUB>X</SUB> = -1, suggesting that the dark energy is indeed the cosmological constant. I will also discuss future prospects for using SNe Ia to further improve our knowledge of the cosmological parameters, with an assessment of possible systematic effects (dust, SN evolution, lensing, etc.). If time permits, I will evaluate the potential of Type II (hydrogen-rich) SNe for cosmological studies., We discuss the use of the MGS MAG/ER instrument in the characterization of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar energetic particles (SEPs) at Mars. The Electron Reflectometer (ER) onboard Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) is an imaging electrostatic analyzer designed to measure the energy/angle distributions of 10 eV to 20 keV electrons. During quiet conditions, the ER has a background count rate, integrated over the entire anode, of about 7 counts/sec (c/s). This background is caused by high energy particles that penetrate the ~2-mm-thick instrument casing and impact the detector. Since these particles bypass the electrostatic analyzer section, they produce a count rate that is independent of the instrument's energy sweep, typically dominating the signal in the highest 2-3 energy channels. During CME and SEP events, these background count rates increase by several orders of magnitude or more. Using these penetrating particle counts, we show several examples of classical SEP and CME shock arrival profiles at Mars obtained during the MGS mapping orbit, including events from the recent October-November storms in 2003. In many cases the ER data interpretation is supported by magnetic field enhancements, including some examples of the direct measurement of the shock. We also discuss the time variability of these events in orbit around Mars, comparisons to simultaneous measurements by the MARIE instrument and at Earth by the ACE spacecraft, the implications of these results for CME velocity models, and the resulting radiation environment at the surface of Mars., The hard X-ray source in the ""giant"" solar flare on 4 November 2003 ( 1947 UT) was observed by instruments aboard two spacecraft: RHESSI, located near the Earth, and Ulysses, located at 114 degrees west of the Sun-Earth line at a distance of 5.23 AU from the Sun. While Ulysses observed hard X-rays during most of the flare, RHESSI observations covered only the early rise and part of the decay of the flare. The maximum of the flare could not be observed by RHESSI because of satellite night. The H-alpha flare (importance 3B) was located at S19 W83 in the active region NOAA 10486. The associated soft X-ray emission, observed by GOES, saturated during the period 1943-1958 UT. It has been estimated that the soft X-ray maximum occurred at 1947 UT with peak flux equivalent to NOAA class X28. The flare produced intense microwave radio emission. At 15.4 GHz a peak flux of 60000 sfu was observed at 1945 UT. Intense type II, III and IV radio bursts have also been reported at metric and decimetric wavelengths. RHESSI has provided 10-50 keV X-ray images and spectra during 1930-1938 UT (the early rise of the flare) and 10-30 keV images and spectra during 2016-2114 UT (a part of the decay of the flare). Ulysses observed an increase in 25-150 keV X-rays from 1933 UT to 2015 UT. The peak counting rate, corrected for live time and normalized to Earth's distance from the Sun, was 1.0E+07 counts per sec. It occurred at 1944 UT in close time coincidence with the maximum in 15.4 GHz microwave emission and 3 min before the maximum in the soft X-ray emission. This indicates that the X-ray emission observed by Ulysses was mostly non-thermal. An assumed differential hard X-ray spectrum with power law exponent of -3.5 for &gt;20 keV photons, leads to an energy dissipation rate of 5.0E+31 ergs per sec at the time of the hard X-ray maximum. The total energy in &gt;20 keV electrons released during the flare is estimated to be 1.0E+34 ergs. Implications of such a large magnitude of energy release for models of solar flares will be briefly discussed., The interaction of Titan's ionosphere with Saturn's magnetospheric plasma is complicated by the significant size of the ion gyroradii relative to the size of Titan. Voyager 1 found a two species plasma consisting of H<SUP>+</SUP> and N<SUP>+</SUP> with number densities of 0.1 and 0.2 cm<SUP>-3</SUP> respectively, near Titan. The gyroradii of the incident N<SUP>+</SUP> was found to be 2.25 R<SUB>T</SUB> (1 R<SUB>T</SUB> = 2575 km), while the gyroradii of the H<SUP>+</SUP> was smaller at 0.16 R<SUB>T</SUB>. In addition Voyager detected the presence of several pickup ion species. The heavy pickup ion species (N<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUB>2</SUB>CN<SUP>+</SUP>, C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>5</SUB><SUP>+</SUP>) are expected to have gyroradii 4-5 R<SUB>T</SUB>. The scale of the interaction region is dominated by the size of the ambient and pickup ion gyroradii rather than the size of Titan. We investigate Titan's interaction with its surrounding plasma environment using multispecies hybrid simulations. We use a H<SUP>+</SUP> and N<SUP>+</SUP> upstream plasma and represent Titan's ionosphere by three generic ion species, a light, medium and heavy using the same formalism as Cravens et al.(1998). The magnetospheric plasma parameters (density, temperature, magnetic field and velocity) near Titan are based on 3-D MHD simulations of Saturn's magnetosphere (Hansen, 2001). We apply our results to the conditions expected at Titan during the first flyby of Cassini in October later this year., The Sun frequently accelerates electrons in solar flares and type III radio bursts. Some of the accelerated electrons lose their energy by collisions in the denser, lower solar atmosphere producing hard X-ray (HXR) emissions, while others escape into interplanetary space. Whether the HXR producing and the escaping electrons are accelerated by the same mechanism is not known. We present a combined study of RHESSI X-ray observations and WIND/3dp in situ electron observations taken near 1~AU. Electron events with a solar release time in close temporal agreement with the HXR peak time are selected. For these events, the electron spectrum measured at 1~AU is compared with the electron spectrum derived from the HXR observations. We find the derived and the observed electron spectrum do not agree with a simple model of electron acceleration high in the corona with downward moving electrons producing HXRs in the lower, denser corona (thick target model) and upwards moving electrons escaping into interplanetary space without energy changes; the observed electron spectrum at 1 AU would predict a much harder HXR spectrum than what is observed. More complicated models including the effects of how particle escape from the acceleration cite are need. That a high coronal acceleration can be excluded makes it hard to explain how the low energy electrons, down to a few hundred eV, can escape to ~1~AU. This suggests that two different mechanisms may be accelerating electrons and that the HXR emission is not related to the electrons seen at 1~AU despite the close temporal correlation., We present adaptive optics (AO) observations of Io taken with the W.M. Keck II telescope on 18 December 2001 (UT) before the satellite went into eclipse, and while it was in Jupiter's shadow. Making these kind of Io-in-eclipse observations, as well as the associated data reduction and analysis are challenging; hence one focus of the paper is to explain the methods and tools used for these data sets. For the sunlit images Io itself was used as the wavefront reference source, while nearby Ganymede was used as reference 'star' when Io was in eclipse. Observations were obtained in K'-, L'-, and M-bands. The sunlit images have been deconvolved using MISTRAL. The Io-in-eclipse data were deconvolved with IDAC and MISTRAL. The former gives better results, both in absolute photometry and in matching the original images. We determined the flux densities of the hot spots from the original Io-in-eclipse data with StarFinder, as well as from the deconvolved images by integrating the intensity over the relevant areas. We determined the highly anisoplanatic PSF via a FFT method from the original data, and used this in StarFinder and as a starting PSF for IDAC and MISTRAL. We derived temperatures and areal coverage of all 19 spots detected in both K'- and L'-band images of Io-in-eclipse. We also determined temperatures and areal coverage of the hot spots visible on the L'- and M-band images of sunlit Io. Most volcanoes contain a compact hot 'core' (≲10 km <SUP>2</SUP> at 600-800 K) within a larger area at lower temperatures (e.g., ∼10 <SUP>2</SUP>-10 <SUP>4</SUP> km <SUP>2</SUP> at 300-500 K). The total heat flow contributed by these active volcanoes is 0.2 W m <SUP>-2</SUP>, ∼8% of the average global heat flow measured at 5-20 μm by Veeder et al. [J. Geophys. Res. 99 (1994) 17095]., We report the results of our study of arcminute scale anisotropy in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) with the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association (BIMA) array. The survey consists of eighteen independent fields selected for low infrared dust emission. Over 1000 hours of integration were dedicated to the project in order to explore the contribution of the Sunyzev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect to CMB anisotropy on scales between 1 ' and 2 ' . Using observations with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 4.8 GHz, we have identified point sources which could act as contaminants in estimates of the CMB power spectrum and removed them in the analysis. Modeling the observed power spectrum with a single flat band power of average multipole of ℓ eff = 6864, we find D T 2 = 170 +/- 110 mK 2 at 68% confidence. We have also divided the data into two bins corresponding to different spatial resolutions in the power spectrum. We find D[Special characters omitted.] = 220 +/- 130 mK 2 at 68% confidence for CMB flat band power described by an average multipole of ℓ eff = 5237 and D[Special characters omitted.] &lt; 840 mK 2 at 95% confidence for ℓ eff = 8748. Monte Carlo simulations were used to compare the BIMA images to images generated from a model of instrumental noise and to images generated from a model of instrumental noise added to SZ clusters. Analysis of the im age statistics indicated that although the BIMA images were consistent with the Monte Carlo realizations of an SZ sky, they were not significantly different from observations including only instrumental noise. Follow-up optical observations using the Keck and Kitt Peak observatories were used to search for decrements in the BIMA data that are correlated with overdense regions of optical galaxies, but produced no significant evidence for galaxy clusters in the BIMA data., We present the results from a series of collisionless N-body simulations of major mergers of galaxy dark matter haloes with density profiles having either inner cusps or cores. Our simulations range from 2 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> to 10<SUP>7</SUP> particles, allowing us to probe the phase-space distribution of dark matter particles in the innermost regions (less than 0.005 virial radii) of cold dark matter haloes, a subject of much recent debate. We find that a major merger of two cored haloes yields a cored halo and does not result in a cuspy profile seen in many cosmological simulations. This result is unchanged if we consider mergers with parent mass ratios of 3:1 instead of 1:1. Mergers of a cuspy halo with either a cored halo or a second cuspy halo of equal mass, on the other hand, produce cuspy haloes with a slightly reduced inner logarithmic slope. Cuspy haloes, once formed, therefore appear resilient to major mergers. We find the velocity structure of the remnants to be mildly anisotropic, with a Maxwellian velocity distribution near the centre but not in the outer portions of the final haloes. Violent relaxation is effective only during the early phase of mergers, with phase mixing likely to be the dominant relaxation process at late times., We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 and deep ground-based images of the Red Rectangle (RR), a bipolar proto-planetary nebula associated with the post-AGB binary system HD 44179. The high-resolution HST images reveal complex new structures, many of them unique to this object. The RR nebula is dominated by a discontinuous ``bicone,'' whose bright, sharp linear edges give the nebula an overall X-shaped appearance. The edges of the bicone are connected by a remarkable series of linear features elongated perpendicular to the radius vector, giving the object a ladder-like structure. The ``rungs'' of the ladder structure show a quasi-periodic spacing, suggesting that they have arisen from discrete episodes of mass loss from the central star, separated by a few hundred years. The total timescale over which mass has been shed into the visible nebula is of order 14,000 yr. Outside the X-shaped bicone, parabolas curl inward, resembling wineglasses, which terminate on the bicone edges in large, limb-brightened vortices. The central object is bisected by a dark band, indicating that the star is not seen directly but is instead obscured by a surrounding opaque dust disk. <P />Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555., We derive general equations for nonlinearity corrections and statistical uncertainty (variance) estimates for data acquired with near-infrared detectors employing correlated double sampling, multiple correlated double sampling (Fowler sampling), and uniformly spaced continuous readout techniques. We compare our equation for the variance on each pixel associated with Fowler sampling with data taken with the array installed in the near-infrared cross-dispersed spectrograph (SpeX) at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility and find that it provides an accurate representation of the empirical results. This comparison also reveals that the read noise associated with a single readout of the SpeX array increases with the number of nondestructive reads, n<SUB>r</SUB>, as n<SUP>0.16</SUP><SUB>r</SUB>. This implies that the effective read noise of a stored image decreases as n<SUP>-0.34</SUP><SUB>r</SUB>, shallower than the expected rate of n<SUP>-0.5</SUP><SUB>r</SUB>. The cause of this read noise behavior is uncertain but it may be due to heating of the array as a result of the multiple readouts. Such behavior may be generic to arrays that employ correlated or multiple correlated double sampling readouts., A class of black holes of intermediate mass is expected but has never been detected. The suggestion that these beasts might lurk behind powerful X-ray sources in nearby galaxies is now strengthened., We outline the theory and practice of measuring the four Stokes parameters of spectral lines in emission/absorption observations. We apply these concepts to our Arecibo H I absorption line data and present the results. We include a detailed discussion of instrumental effects arising from polarized beam structure and its interaction with the spatially extended emission line structure. At Arecibo, linear polarization [Stokes (Q, U)] has much larger instrumental effects than circular (Stokes V). We show how to reduce the instrumental contributions to V and to evaluate upper limits to its remaining instrumental errors by using the (Q, U) results. These efforts work well for opacity spectra but not for emission spectra. Arecibo's large central blockage exacerbates these effects, particularly for emission profiles, and other telescopes with weaker sidelobes are not as susceptible. We present graphical results for 41 sources; we analyze these absorption spectra in terms of Gaussian components, which number 136, and present physical parameters including magnetic field for each., We derive octupole-level secular perturbation equations for hierarchical triple systems, using classical Hamiltonian perturbation techniques. By extending previous work done to leading (quadrupole) order to octupole level (i.e., including terms of order alpha^3, where alpha = a_1/a_2 &lt; 1 is the ratio of semimajor axes) we obtain expressions that are applicable to a much wider range of parameters. For triple systems containing a close inner binary, we also discuss the possible interaction between the classical Newtonian perturbations and the general relativistic precession of the inner orbit. In some cases we show that this interaction can lead to resonances and a significant increase in the maximum amplitude of eccentricity perturbations. We establish the validity of our analytic expressions by providing detailed comparisons with the results of direct numerical integrations of the three-body problem obtained for a large number of representative cases. We also discuss applications of the theory in the context of several observed triple systems of current interest, including the millisecond pulsar PSR B1620-26 in M4, the giant planet in 16 Cygni, and the protostellar binary TMR-1. [short version], The FUV instrument on the IMAGE spacecraft frequently observes intense ultraviolet (UV) emissions from a localized High Latitude Dayside Aurora (HiLDA) poleward of the general auroral oval location [, 2003a]. It has been shown that this aurora is entirely created by high-energy precipitating electrons, which have probably been accelerated in a quasi-static field-aligned electric potential. Here we extend the previous case study to an investigation of the HiLDA occurrence in the Northern Hemisphere over more than 2 years and compare it with the averaged solar wind plasma and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) properties. HiLDA occurrence is strongly biased toward low solar wind density and IMF with positive B<SUB>z</SUB>, strong positive B<SUB>y</SUB> (clock angles around 70°), and negative B<SUB>x</SUB> components. Such IMF conditions are favorable for lobe reconnection in the Northern Hemisphere, and the creation of a dominating dusk convection cell with an upward field-aligned current in its center. Additionally, we investigate the seasonal occurrence of this phenomenon, which shows a maximum in the Northern Hemisphere during sunlit summer months and an almost complete absence in the dark winter. In contrast to the daylight-suppressed aurora in the auroral oval, the HiLDA cannot be the result of ionospheric feedback due to the stronger ionospheric conductance in sunlight. Instead, in agreement with ionospheric convection models, it is caused by the asymmetry of field-aligned currents in different seasons, which result from the different dipole tilt angles in summer and winter. We further discuss two scenarios for how the low solar wind density can enhance the field-aligned parallel potential over the dusk convection cell., Observations from the FAST satellite are used to create a model for dispersive Alfvén waves above the auroral oval. Using this model, it is shown how these waves may accelerate ionospheric ions transverse to the geomagnetic field and cause ion outflow. The model waves grow from ionospheric conductivity variations due to auroral electron precipitation and resonate in the cavity between the ionosphere and the peak in the Alfvén speed that occurs at altitudes of ∼1 Earth radius (Re). By tracing ions in the model wave field, it is demonstrated that for transverse wave amplitudes (E<SUB>⊥</SUB>) satisfying E<SUB>⊥</SUB>/B<SUB>o</SUB> &lt; Ω<SUB>i</SUB>/k<SUB>⊥</SUB> (where B<SUB>o</SUB> is the geomagnetic field strength, k<SUB>⊥</SUB> is the perpendicular wave number, and Ω<SUB>i</SUB> is the ion gyrofrequency) the ion motion in the wave field is coherent and the ions may become trapped in the transverse wave potential. In Alfvén waves having two-dimensional structure transverse to B<SUB>o</SUB>, these ions may be accelerated up to a transverse energy that provides an ion gyrodiameter roughly equivalent to the perpendicular scale or wavelength (λ<SUB>⊥</SUB>) of the wave. Alternatively, when E<SUB>⊥</SUB>/B<SUB>o</SUB> &gt; Ω<SUB>i</SUB>/k<SUB>⊥</SUB> the ion motion may become stochastic allowing acceleration to energies exceeding that prescribed by λ<SUB>⊥</SUB>. The transversely accelerated ions in both the coherent and stochastic cases flow upward from the ionosphere under the influence of the mirror force to altitudes of 1 Earth radii over timescales as small as a few seconds to minutes with energies in the keV range. Ions accelerated by these means may account for the intense outflowing ion fluxes observed in Alfvén waves above the auroral oval., We have detected the intrinsic size of Sagittarius A*, the Galactic center radio source associated with a supermassive black hole, showing that the short-wavelength radio emission arises from very near the event horizon of the black hole. Radio observations with the Very Long Baseline Array show that the source has a size of 24 +/- 2 Schwarzschild radii at 7-millimeter wavelength. In one of eight 7-millimeter epochs, we also detected an increase in the intrinsic size of 60<SUP>+25</SUP>&lt;INF ARRANGE=""STAGGER""&gt;-17%. These observations place a lower limit to the mass density of Sagittarius A* of 1.4 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> solar masses per cubic astronomical unit., CO and H I velocity fields of seven nearby spiral galaxies, derived from radio-interferometric observations, are decomposed into Fourier components whose radial variation is used to search for evidence of radial gas flows. Additional information provided by optical or near-infrared isophotes is also considered, including the relationship between the morphological and kinematic position angles. To assist in interpreting the data, we present detailed modeling that demonstrates the effects of bar streaming, inflow, and a warp on the observed Fourier components. We find in all of the galaxies evidence for either elliptical streaming or a warped disk over some range in radius, with deviations from pure circular rotation at the level of ~20-60 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Evidence for kinematic warps is observed in several cases well inside R<SUB>25</SUB>. No unambiguous evidence for radial inflows is seen in any of the seven galaxies, and we are able to place an upper limit of ~5-10 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> (3%-5% of the circular speed) on the magnitude of any radial inflow in the inner regions of NGC 4414, NGC 5033, and NGC 5055. We conclude that the inherent nonaxisymmetry of spiral galaxies is the greatest limitation to the direct detection of radial inflows., Observations with the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) have shown the Coma Cluster to be a source of EUV emission in excess of that produced by X-ray gas in the cluster. We have reexamined the EUVE data on this cluster in an attempt to obtain clues as to the origin of this emission. We find two important new results. First, the ratio between the azimuthally averaged EUV excess emission and the ROSAT hard X-ray flux is constant as a function of distance from the cluster center outward. Second, a correlation analysis between the EUV excess emission and the X-ray emission shows that on a detailed level the EUV excess is spatially closely related to the X-ray emission. These findings contradict previous suggestions as to the underlying source of the diffuse EUV emission in Coma and provide important information in regard to the true source of this emission. We propose a new explanation for the source of this emission: inverse Compton scattering of microwave background photons by secondary electrons and positrons. We explore this possibility in some detail and show that it is consistent with all of the available observational evidence. The parent cosmic-ray protons may have been produced by any of a number of sources, including supernovae, active galaxies, galactic winds, and cluster formation shocks, but we believe that the most likely source is cluster formation shocks. If the EUV emission in the Coma Cluster is, in fact, the result of secondary electrons, this may be the only direct evidence for secondary electrons in the intracluster medium of a cluster of galaxies, since recent work suggests that secondary electrons may not be the cause of radio halos., We are gathering archival observations to determine the photometric history of the unique and unexplained eclipses of the pre-main-sequence star KH 15D. Here we present a light curve from 1967 to 1982, based on photographic plates from Asiago Observatory. During this time, the system alternated periodically between bright and faint states, as observed today. However, the bright state was 0.9 mag brighter than the modern value, and the fractional variation between bright and faint states (ΔI=0.7 mag) was smaller than observed today (3.5 mag). A possible explanation for these findings is that the system contains a second star that was previously blended with the eclipsing star but is now completely obscured. <P />Based on data from the digitized Italian photographic archives, produced under contract MIUR/Cofin 2002 to C. Barbieri, Dipartimento di Astronomia, Università di Padova., The stable isotopic composition of materials such as glacial ice, tree rings, lake sediments, and speleothems from low-to-mid latitudes contains information about past changes in temperature ( T) and precipitation amount ( P). However, the transfer functions which link δ <SUP>18</SUP>O <SUB>p</SUB> to changes in T or P, dδ <SUP>18</SUP>O <SUB>p</SUB>/d T and dδ <SUP>18</SUP>O <SUB>p</SUB>/d P, can exhibit significant temporal and spatial variability in these regions. In areas affected by the Southeast Asian monsoon, past variations in δ <SUP>18</SUP>O and δD of precipitation have been attributed to variations in monsoon intensity, storm tracks, and/or variations in temperature. Proper interpretation of past δ <SUP>18</SUP>O <SUB>p</SUB> variations here requires an understanding of these complicated stable isotope systematics. Since temperature and precipitation are positively correlated in China and have opposite effects on δ <SUP>18</SUP>O <SUB>p</SUB>, it is necessary to determine which of these effects is dominant for a specific region in order to perform even qualitative paleoclimate reconstructions. Here, we evaluate the value of the transfer functions in modern precipitation to more accurately interpret the paleorecord. The strength of these transfer functions in China is investigated using multiple regression analysis of data from 10 sites within the Global Network for Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP). δ <SUP>18</SUP>O <SUB>p</SUB> is modeled as a function of both temperature and precipitation. The magnitude and signs of the transfer functions at any given site are closely related to the degree of summer monsoon influence. δ <SUP>18</SUP>O <SUB>p</SUB> values at sites with intense summer monsoon precipitation are more dependent on the amount of precipitation than on temperature, and therefore exhibit more negative values in the summer. In contrast, δ <SUP>18</SUP>O <SUB>p</SUB> values at sites that are unaffected by summer monsoon precipitation exhibit strong relationships between δ <SUP>18</SUP>O <SUB>p</SUB> and temperature. The sites that are near the northern limit of the summer monsoon exhibit dependence on both temperature and amount of precipitation. Comparison with simple linear models (δ <SUP>18</SUP>O <SUB>p</SUB> as a function of T or P) and a geographic model (δ <SUP>18</SUP>O <SUB>p</SUB> as a function of latitude and altitude) shows that the multiple regression model is more successful at reproducing δ <SUP>18</SUP>O <SUB>p</SUB> values at sites that are strongly influenced by the summer monsoon. The fact that the transfer function values are highly spatially variable and closely related to the degree of summer monsoon influence suggests that these values may also vary temporally. Since the Southeast Asian monsoon intensity is known to exhibit large variations on a number of timescales (annual to glacial-interglacial), and the magnitude and sign of the transfer functions is related to monsoon intensity, we suggest that as monsoon intensity changes, the magnitude and possibly even the sign of the transfer functions may vary. Therefore, quantitative paleoclimate reconstructions based on δ <SUP>18</SUP>O <SUB>p</SUB> variations may not be valid., We present results from an observing campaign of the molecular content of the coma of comet C/1999 S4 (LINEAR) carried out jointly with the millimeter arrays of the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association (BIMA) and the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO). Using the BIMA array in autocorrelation (``single-dish'') mode, we detected weak HCN J=1-0 emission from comet C/1999 S4 (LINEAR) at 14+/-4 mK km s<SUP>-1</SUP> averaged over the 143"" beam. The 3 days over which emission was detected, 2000 July 21.9-24.2, immediately precede the reported full breakup of the nucleus of this comet. During this same period, we find an upper limit for HCN J=1-0 of 144 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP> km s<SUP>-1</SUP> (203 mK km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) in the 9<SUP>''</SUP>×12<SUP>''</SUP> synthesized beam of combined observations of BIMA and OVRO in cross-correlation (``imaging'') mode. Together with reported values of HCN J=1-0 emission in the 28"" IRAM 30 m beam, our data probe the spatial distribution of the HCN emission from radii of 1300 to 19,000 km. Using literature results of HCN excitation in cometary comae, we find that the relative line fluxes in the 12<SUP>''</SUP>×9<SUP>''</SUP>, 28"", and 143"" beams are consistent with expectations for a nuclear source of HCN and expansion of the volatile gases and evaporating icy grains following a Haser model., The coupling of gravity to matter is explored in the linearized gravity limit. The usual derivation of gravity-matter couplings within the quantum-field-theoretic framework is reviewed. A number of inconsistencies between this derivation of the couplings and the known results of tidal effects on test particles according to classical general relativity are pointed out. As a step towards resolving these inconsistencies, a general laboratory frame fixed on the worldline of an observer is constructed. In this frame, the dynamics of nonrelativistic test particles in the linearized gravity limit is studied, and their Hamiltonian dynamics is derived. It is shown that for stationary metrics this Hamiltonian reduces to the usual Hamiltonian for nonrelativistic particles undergoing geodesic motion. For nonstationary metrics with long-wavelength gravitational waves present (GWs), it reduces to the Hamiltonian for a nonrelativistic particle undergoing geodesic deviation motion. Arbitrary-wavelength GWs couple to the test particle through a vector-potential-like field N<SUB>a</SUB>, the net result of the tidal forces that the GW induces in the system, namely, a local velocity field on the system induced by tidal effects, as seen by an observer in the general laboratory frame. Effective electric and magnetic fields, which are related to the electric and magnetic parts of the Weyl tensor, are constructed from N<SUB>a</SUB> that obey equations of the same form as Maxwell’s equations. A gedankin gravitational Aharonov-Bohm-type experiment using N<SUB>a</SUB> to measure the interference of quantum test particles is presented., Experiments [T. Irifune (1994) Nature 370, 131-133; E. Ito et al. (1998) Geophys. Res. Lett. 25, 821-824; A. Kubo, M. Akaogi (2000) Phys. Earth Planet. Int. 121, 85-102] indicate that (Mg,Fe)SiO <SUB>3</SUB> perovskite, commonly believed to be the most abundant mineral in the Earth, is the preferred host phase of Al <SUB>2</SUB>O <SUB>3</SUB> in the Earth's lower mantle. Aiming to better understand the effects of Al <SUB>2</SUB>O <SUB>3</SUB> on the thermoelastic properties of the lower mantle, we use atomistic models to examine the chemistry and elasticity of solid solutions within the MgSiO <SUB>3</SUB>(perovskite)-Al <SUB>2</SUB>O <SUB>3</SUB>(corundum)-MgO(periclase) mineral assemblage under conditions pertinent to the lower mantle: low Al cation concentrations, P=25-100 GPa, and T=1000-2000 K. We assess the relative stabilities of two likely substitution mechanisms of Al into MgSiO <SUB>3</SUB> perovskite in terms of reactions involving MgSiO <SUB>3</SUB>, MgO, and Al <SUB>2</SUB>O <SUB>3</SUB>, in a manner similar to the 0 Kelvin calculations of Brodholt [J.P. Brodholt (2000) Nature 407, 620-622] and Yamamoto et al. [T. Yamamoto et al. (2003) Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 206, 617-625]. We determine the equilibrium composition of the assemblage by examining the chemical potentials of the Al <SUB>2</SUB>O <SUB>3</SUB> and MgO components in solid solution with MgSiO <SUB>3</SUB>, as functions of concentration. We find that charge coupled substitution dominates at lower mantle pressures and temperatures. Oxygen vacancy-forming substitution accounts for 3-4% of Al substitution at shallow lower mantle conditions, and less than 1% in the deep mantle. For these two pressure regimes, the corresponding adiabatic bulk moduli of aluminous perovskite are 2% and 1% lower than that of pure MgSiO <SUB>3</SUB> perovskite., We present the first detection of NH<SUB>3</SUB> ice in the thermal infrared in Jupiter's atmosphere using Cassini CIRS observations in the 10-μm region obtained on 31 December 2000 and 1 January 2001. <P />We identify a brightness temperature difference αtbnd T<SUB>B</SUB>(1040 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>)-T<SUB>B</SUB>(1060 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>) as an indicator of spectrally identifiable NH<SUB>3</SUB> ice, where 1040 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> is an adjacent continuum region and 1060 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> is the NH<SUB>3</SUB> ice feature. Higher values of α imply a stronger NH<SUB>3</SUB> ice signature in the spectrum. Using midlatitude zonally averaged CIRS spectra, we demonstrate systematic spatial variations in α, with the highest values at the equator and near 23°N. <P />In one CIRS spectral average (covering 22-25°N and 140-240°W), our radiative transfer models are consistent with an optical depth of 0.75±0.25 for NH<SUB>3</SUB> ice particles modeled as randomly oriented 4:1 prolate spheroids (volume equivalent radius=0.79 μm). Particles larger or smaller than 1 μm by about a factor of 2 would be unable to duplicate the observed NH<SUB>3</SUB> ice feature at 1060 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>: absorption due to larger particles is excessively broadened, and absorption due to smaller particles is hidden by NH<SUB>3</SUB> gas absorption at 1067 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. We also modeled an average spectrum for a second region on Jupiter (14-17°N and 10-70°W), finding an upper limit of τ=0.2 for the same NH<SUB>3</SUB> ice particle type. The choice of prolate spheroid particles is based on laboratory studies of NH<SUB>3</SUB> ice aerosols, although 1-μm Mie-scattering spheres would also have detectable signatures at 1060 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. We model the 1-μm NH<SUB>3</SUB> ice cloud with a particle-to-gas scale height ratio H<SUB>p</SUB>/H<SUB>g</SUB>=1. For both CIRS spectra analyzed, the spectrum at frequencies greater than 1100 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> also requires a second cloud with essentially grey absorption, which we modeled using 10-μm NH<SUB>3</SUB> ice spheres distributed with H<SUB>p</SUB>/H<SUB>g</SUB>=1/8 and a cloud base at 790 mbar., We measured the concentrations of noble gases in 32 ordinary chondrites from the Dar al Gani (DaG) region, Libya, as well as concentrations of the cosmogenic radionuclides 14C, 10Be, 26Al, 36Cl, and 41Ca in 18 of these samples. Although the trapped noble gases in five DaG samples show ratios typical of solar or planetary gases, in all other DaG samples, they are dominated by atmospheric contamination, which increases with the degree of weathering. Cosmic ray exposure (CRE) ages of DaG chondrites range from ~1 Myr to 53 Myr. The CRE age distribution of 10 DaG L chondrites shows a cluster around 40 Myr due to four members of a large L6 chondrite shower. The CRE age distribution of 19 DaG H chondrites shows only three ages coinciding with the main H chondrite peak at ~7 Myr, while seven ages are &lt;5 Myr. Two of these H chondrites with short CRE ages (DaG 904 and 908) show evidence of a complex exposure history. Five of the H chondrites show evidence of high shielding conditions, including low 22Ne/21Ne ratios and large contributions of neutron-capture 36Cl and 41Ca. These samples represent fragments of two or more large pre-atmospheric objects, which supports the hypothesis that the high H/L chondrite ratio at DaG is due to one or more large unrecognized showers. The 14C concentrations correspond to terrestrial ages &lt;35 kyr, similar to terrestrial ages of chondrites from other regions in the Sahara but younger than two DaG achondrites. Despite the loss of cosmogenic 36Cl and 41Ca during oxidation of metal and troilite, concentrations of 36Cl and 41Ca in the silicates are also consistent with 14C ages &lt;35 kyr. The only exception is DaG 343 (H4), which has a 41Ca terrestrial age of 150 ± 40 kyr. This old age shows that not only iron meteorites and achondrites but also chondrites can survive the hot desert environment for more than 50 kyr. A possible explanation is that older meteorites were covered by soils during wetter periods and were recently exhumed by removal of these soils due to deflation during more arid periods, such as the current one, which started ~3000 years ago. Finally, based on the 26Al/21Ne and 10Be/21Ne systematics in 16 DaG meteorites, we derived more reliable estimates of the 10Be/21Ne production rate ratio, which seems more sensitive to shielding than was predicted by the semi-empirical model of Graf et al. (1990) but less sensitive than was predicted by the purely physical model of Leya et al. (2000)., We address three questions regarding solar system planets. Whatdetermined their number? Why are their orbits nearly circular andcoplanar? How long did they take to form?We pick up the story of planet formation at the end of oligarchy, whenthe oligarchs'surface mass density matched that of the small bodies they were accreting. Dynamical frictionby the small bodies was no longerable to balance viscous stirring, so the oligarchs' velocitydispersion increased to the extent that their orbits crossed. Anessential assumption of our investigation is that as the big bodiesgot bigger, the small ones got smaller as the result of undergoing acollisional fragmentation cascade. It follows that oligarchy was abrief stage in solar system evolution. What happened next differed inthe inner and outer parts of the planetary system. In the inner part,where the ratio of the escape velocity from the surfaces of theplanets to the escape velocity from their orbits is smaller thanunity, big bodies collided and coalesced once their random velocitiesbecame comparable to their escape velocities. In the outer part, wherethis ratio is larger than unity, the random velocities of some of thebig bodies continued to rise until they were ejected. In both parts,the number density of the big bodies eventually decreased to theextent that gravitational interactions among them no longer producedlarge scale chaos. After that their orbital eccentricities andinclinations were damped by dynamical friction from the remainingsmall bodies.A few implications of the above scenario are worth noting. Impactsamong protoplanets of comparable size were common in the inner planetsystem but not in the outer. Ejections from the outer planet systemincluded several bodies with masses in excess of Earth afteroligarchy., We characterize the evolution of spectral and temporal properties of several Galactic black hole transients during outburst decay using the data from well-sampled Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer Proportional Counter Array observations close to the transition to the low/hard state. We find several global patterns of evolution for spectral and temporal parameters before, during, and after the transition. We show that the changes in temporal properties (sudden increase or decrease in the rms amplitude of variability) are much sharper than the changes in the spectral properties, and it is much easier to identify a state transition with the temporal properties. The spectral index shows a drop 3-5 days before the transition for some of our sources. The ratio of the power-law flux to the total flux in the 3-25 keV band increases close to the transition, which may mean that the system must be dominated by the coronal emission for the transition to occur. We also show that the power-law flux shows a sharp change along with the temporal properties during the transitions, which may indicate a threshold transition volume for the corona. The evolution of the spectral and temporal properties after the transition is consistent with the idea that the inner accretion disk moves away from the black hole. Based on the evolution of spectral and temporal parameters and changes during the transitions, we discuss possible scenarios of how the transition is happening., We use the two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to study the correlation between the 60 cosmic ray events above 4×10<SUP>19</SUP> eV from the Akeno Giant Air Shower Array (AGASA) experiment and the positions of infrared luminous galaxies from the IRAS Point Source Catalog. These galaxies are expected to be hosts to gamma ray bursts (GRB’s) and magnetars, both of which are associated with core collapse supernovae and have been proposed as possible acceleration sites for ultrahigh energy cosmic rays. We find consistency between the models and the AGASA events to have been drawn from the same underlying distribution of positions on the sky with KS probabilities ≳50%. Application of the same test to the 11 highest AGASA events above 10<SUP>20</SUP> eV, however, yields a KS probability of &lt;0.5%, rejecting the models at 99.5% significance level. Taken at face value, these highest energy results suggest that the existing cosmic ray events above 10<SUP>20</SUP> eV do not owe their origin to long burst GRB’s, rapidly rotating magnetars, or any other events associated with core collapse supernovae. The larger data set expected from the AUGER experiment will test whether this conclusion is real or is a statistical fluke that we estimate to be at the 2σ level., The scalar dark matter candidate in a prototypical theory space little Higgs model is investigated. We review all details of the model pertinent to a relic density calculation. We perform a thermal relic density calculation including couplings to the gauge and Higgs sectors of the model. We find two regions of parameter space that give acceptable dark matter abundances. The first region has a dark matter candidate with a mass O(100 GeV), the second region has a candidate with a mass greater than O(500 GeV). The dark matter candidate in either region is an admixture of an SU(2) triplet and an SU(2) singlet, thereby constituting a possible weakly interacting massive particle., Using magnetometer and electron observations from the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) and the Wind spacecraft we show that the region of magnetic field pile-up and density decrease located between the Martian ionosphere and bow shock exhibit strong similarities with the plasma depletion layer (PDL) observed upstream of the Earth's magnetopause in the absence of magnetic reconnection when the magnetopause is a solid obstacle in the solar wind. A PDL is formed upstream of the terrestrial magnetopause when the magnetic field piles up against the obstacle and particles in the pile-up region are squeezed away from the high magnetic pressure region along the field lines as the flux tubes convect toward the magnetopause. We here discuss the possibility that at least part of the region of magnetic field pile-up and density depletion upstream of Mars may be formed by the same physical processes which generate the PDL upstream of the Earth's magnetopause. More complete ion, electron, and neutral measurements are needed to conclusively determine the relative importance of the plasma depletion process versus exospheric processes., We present results from the BIMA survey of <SUP>12</SUP>CO(1→0)emission from M33. The survey resolves this emission into individualobjects making this study the first unbiased, complete census of giantmolecular clouds (GMCs) in a spiral galaxy. The GMCs are clearlyassociated with dense atomic gas, suggesting formation from the HI. Moreover, high resolution observations of these clouds show thatthey appear the same as Milky Way GMCs when viewed through the sameobservational filters. The GMCs show significantly less angularmomentum than predicted by simple formation theories, suggesting theimportance of magnetohydrodynamic effects in their formation., We used cosmogenic nuclide and geochemical mass balance methods to measure long-term rates of chemical weathering and physical erosion across a steep climatic gradient in the Santa Rosa Mountains, Nevada. Our study sites are distributed along a 2 km ridgeline transect that spans 2090 to 2750 m in altitude, and encompasses marked contrasts in both vegetative cover and snow depth, but is underlain by a single, roughly uniform, granodiorite bedrock. Cosmogenic nuclides in colluvial soils reveal that denudation rates vary by less than a factor of 1.4 (104-144 t/km <SUP>2</SUP>/yr) along this transect. Bulk elemental analyses indicate that, relative to the parent rock, soils are less intensively weathered with increasing altitude, and show little evidence of weathering-related mass losses near the top of the ridge. Chemical weathering rates decrease rapidly with increasing altitude, both in absolute terms (from 24 to 0 t/km <SUP>2</SUP>/yr) and as a fraction of total denudation rates (from 20 to 0%). Thus these results indicate an increasing dominance of physical erosion with altitude. The observed decrease in chemical weathering rates is greater than one would predict from the decrease in mean annual temperature using simple weathering kinetics, suggesting that weathering rates along our transect may also be affected by the progressive decline in vegetative cover and increase in snow depth with increasing altitude. These results, considered together with weathering rate measurements for a wide range of climates in the Sierra Nevada, USA, suggest that chemical weathering rates may be particularly sensitive to differences in climate at higher-altitude sites. Consistent with this hypothesis, chemical weathering rates fall virtually to zero at the highest sites on our transect, suggesting that sparsely vegetated, high-altitude crystalline terrain may often be characterized by extremely slow silicate weathering rates., We are developing a 2-detector high resolution Compton telescope utilizing 3D imaging germanium detectors (GeDs) to be flown as a balloon payload in Spring 2004. This instrument is a prototype for the larger Nuclear Compton Telescope (NCT), which utilizes 12-GeDs. NCT is a balloon-borne soft γ-ray (0.2-15 MeV) telescope designed to study, through spectroscopy, imaging, and timing, astrophysical sources of nuclear line emission and γ-ray polarization. The NCT program is designed to develop and test the technologies and analysis techniques crucial for the Advanced Compton Telescope, while studying γ-ray radiation with very high spectral resolution, moderate angular resolution, and high sensitivity. NCT has a novel, ultra-compact design optimized for studying nuclear line emission in the critical 0.5-2 MeV range, and polarization in the 0.2-0.5 MeV range. The prototype flight will critically test the novel instrument technologies, analysis techniques, and background rejection procedures we have developed for high resolution Compton telescopes. In this paper we present the design and preliminary results of laboratory performance tests of the NCT flight electronics., Solid particles in protoplanetary disks that are sufficiently supersolar in metallicity overcome turbulence generated by vertical shear to gravitationally condense into planetesimals. Supersolar metallicities result if solid particles pile up as they migrate starward as a result of aerodynamic drag. Previous analyses of aerodynamic drift rates that account for mean flow differences between gas and particles yield particle pileups. We improve on these studies not only by accounting for the collective inertia of solids relative to that of gas, but also by including the transport of angular momentum by turbulent stresses within the particle layer. These turbulent stresses are derived in a physically self-consistent manner from the structure of marginally Kelvin-Helmholtz turbulent flows. They are not calculated using the usual plate drag formulae, whose use we explain is inappropriate. Accounting for the relative inertia of solids to gas retards, but does not prevent, particle pileups and generates more spatially extended regions of metal enrichment. Turbulent transport hastens pileups. We conclude that particle pileup is a robust outcome in sufficiently passive protoplanetary disks. Connections to observations of circumstellar disks, including the Kuiper Belt, and the architectures of planetary systems are made., The nuclear compton telescope (NCT) is a balloon-borne soft γ-ray (0.2-15 MeV) telescope designed to study astrophysical sources of nuclear line emission and γ-ray polarization. NCT utilizes an array of 12 3-D imaging germanium detectors (GeDs). A 2-GeD prototype of NCT is scheduled to be flown in Spring 2004. The NCT program is designed to develop and test the technologies and analysis techniques crucial for the Advanced Compton Telescope, while studying γ-ray radiation with very high spectral resolution, moderate angular resolution, and high sensitivity. NCT has a novel, ultra-compact design optimized for studying nuclear line emission in the critical 0.5-2 MeV range, and polarization in the 0.2-0.5 MeV range. The prototype flight will critically test the novel instrument technologies, analysis techniques, and background rejection procedures we have developed for high resolution Compton telescopes. In this paper we present an overview of the NCT prototype instrument., We have used laser guide star adaptive optics and a near-infrared dual-channel imaging polarimeter to observe light scattered in the circumstellar environment of Herbig Ae/Be stars on scales of 100 to 300 astronomical units. We revealed a strongly polarized, biconical nebula 10 arc seconds (6000 astronomical units) in diameter around the star LkHα 198 and also observed a polarized jet-like feature associated with the deeply embedded source LkHα 198-IR. The star LkHα 233 presents a narrow, unpolarized dark lane consistent with an optically thick circumstellar disk blocking our direct view of the star. These data show that the lower-mass T Tauri and intermediate mass Herbig Ae/Be stars share a common evolutionary sequence., We look at the impact of infrared (IR) and radio point sources on upcoming large-yield Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) cluster surveys such as those to be undertaken by the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX), the South Pole Telescope (SPT), and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). The IR and radio point-source counts are based on observations by the Submillimeter Common-User Bolometric Array (SCUBA) and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) instruments, respectively. We show that the contributions from IR-source counts, when extrapolated from the SCUBA frequency of 350 GHz to the operating frequencies of these surveys (~100-300 GHz), can be a significant source of additional noise, which needs to be accounted for in order to extract the optimal science from these surveys. These surveys give us an opportunity to study IR sources, their numbers and clustering properties, opening a new window to the high-redshift universe. For the radio point sources, the contribution depends on a more uncertain extrapolation from 40 GHz, but is comparable to the IR near 200 GHz. However, the radio signal may be correlated with clusters of galaxies and have a disproportionately larger effect., The primary scientific objective of RHESSI Small Explorer mission is to investigate the physics of particle acceleration and energy release in solar flares, through imaging and spectroscopy of X-ray/gamma-ray continuum and gamma-ray lines emitted by accelerated electrons and ions, respectively. RHESSI utilizes rotating modulator collimators together with cooled germanium detectors to image X-rays/gamma-rays from 3 keV to 17 MeV. It provides the first hard X-ray imaging spectroscopy, the first high resolution spectroscopy of solar gamma-ray liens, and the first imaging of solar gamma-ray lines and continuum. Here we briefly describe the mission and instrumentation, and illustrate its capabilities with solar and cosmic observations obtained in the first 17 months of operation., We present the baseline telescope design for the telescope for the SuperNova/Acceleration Probe (SNAP) space mission. SNAP""s purpose is to determine expansion history of the Universe by measuring the redshifts, magnitudes, and spectral classifications of thousands of supernovae with unprecedented accuracy. Discovering and measuring these supernovae demand both a wide optical field and a high sensitivity throughout the visible and near IR wavebands. We have adopted the annular-field three-mirror anastigmat (TMA) telescope configuration, whose classical aberrations (including chromatic) are zero. We show a preliminary optmechanical design that includes important features for stray light control and on-orbit adjustment and alignment of the optics. We briefly discuss stray light and tolerance issues, and present a preliminary wavefront error budget for the SNAP Telescope. We conclude by describing some of the design tasks being carried out during the current SNAP research and development phase., Titan possesses an extensive atmosphere and ionosphere and no obvious significant intrinsic magnetic field. Its ionosphere directly interacts with the surrounding plasma environment, forming an induced magnetosphere. Titan was located in Saturn's outer magnetosphere at the time of the Voyager encounter, where that interaction is subsonic, superAlfvénic and submagnetosonic. We present results on Titan's induced magnetosphere from numerical simulations for the Voyager encounter scenario, for other locations around Titan's orbit, and for a case when Titan's orbit at 20 Saturn radii is outside the magnetosphere. The comparison of Titan's induced magnetosphere with other induced magnetospheres at Venus, Mars, and other planetary satellites is briefly considered., I will discuss the intimate connections among neutrino oscillation physics, cosmology, and particle physics, including the baryon asymmetry of the universe., Low stress membrane mirrors will allow improved wave front correction in vision science and astronomical adaptive optics systems. We have fabricated low stress membrane mirrors from single crystal silicon, and flip chip bonded membranes to electrode arrays. These devices operate at lower voltage and have greater stroke than existing membrane mirror devices; they have 256 control electrodes, and are driven by off chip electronics. Devices have a single electrode plane and are pre-biased to allow full wave front correction. We have demonstrated these devices in an adaptive optics system consisting of a coherent source, and a Shack-Hartmann wave front sensor. We compare the experimental performance of the devices to computer simulations and theoretical calculations., The role of photochemically-generated organic aerosols in planetary atmospheres is investigated with laboratory measurements of their formation rates and with observations of aerosol haze on Saturn's moon, Titan. Instrumentation has been developed to photochemically generate organic aerosols while simultaneously monitoring both the concentrations of gas phase species and the formation of organic aerosols. Measurements of concentrations and particle formation are made via mass spectrometry and light scattering, respectively. The photochemical formation of aerosols from pure CH 4 is reported, which provides a dataset that may be used as a benchmark to test photochemical models of aerosol formation in planetary atmospheres. Measurements of particle formation in mixtures of CH 4 and CO 2 show that aerosol formation can occur at lower CH 4 /CO 2 ratios than predicted by models, suggesting that particle formation on the young Earth and Mars may have occurred more readily than previously expected. Ground-based observations of Titan in the near-infrared, using adaptive optics, show that high-resolution spectral maps can determine the spatial and vertical profiles of atmospheric haze. Repeating these observations during the changing seasons on Titan will show how the photochemistry of particle formation couples with atmospheric circulation to seasonally redistribute aerosol hazes on a global scale., We applied global waveform tomography to model radial anisotropy in the whole mantle. We found that in the last few hundred kilometers near the core-mantle boundary, horizontally polarized S-wave velocities (V<SUB>SH</SUB>) are, on average, faster (by ~1%) than vertically polarized S-wave velocities (V<SUB>SV</SUB>), suggesting a large-scale predominance of horizontal shear. This confirms that the D'' region at the base of the mantle is also a mechanical boundary layer for mantle convection. A notable exception to this average signature can be found at the base of the two broad low-velocity regions under the Pacific Ocean and under Africa, often referred to as ``superplumes,'' where the anisotropic pattern indicates the onset of vertical flow., I discuss recent work on the nature of relativistic winds from rotation powered pulsars, focussing on how that energy drives the dynamics of the region where the outflow gets converted to observable synchrotron emission, and on the recent rediscovery that force free winds behave as linear accelerators, with terminal particle energy comparable to the electric potential energy per particle across the open field lines of the outflow., Swift is a first-of-its-kind multiwavelength transient observatory for γ-ray burst astronomy. It has the optimum capabilities for the next breakthroughs in determining the origin of γ-ray bursts and their afterglows, as well as for using bursts to probe the early Universe. Swift will also monitor the soft gamma repeaters and perform the first sensitive hard X-ray survey of the sky. The mission is being developed by an international collaboration and consists of three instruments, the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), the X-ray Telescope (XRT), and the Ultraviolet and Optical Telescope (UVOT). The BAT, a wide-field γ-ray detector, will detect &gt;100 γ-ray bursts per year with a sensitivity 5× that of BATSE. The sensitive narrow-field XRT and UVOT will be autonomously slewed to the burst location within 20-70 s to determine 0.3-5.0″ positions and perform optical, UV, and X-ray spectrophotometry. Strong education/public outreach and follow-up programs will help to engage the public and the astronomical community. Swift launch is planned for late 2004., The Real Astronomy Experience, or RAE, is a new exhibit just beginning development in the late fall of 2002, hopefully to be funded by the US National Science Foundation. RAE will allow public visitors in science centers, museums, and planetaria to operate and acquire images from a either a remote telescope in the southern hemisphere or from IVO data bases. RAE can operate from Europe and North America during daylight at the exhibit site. This project will be implemented also by international Global Hands-On Universe (""GHOU"") collaborators. Greater international success will be facilitated by other GHOU nations joining the collaboration to build a viable network of small, inexpensive telescopes, and federating their data bases for the IVO., We discuss recent work on two topics. In an in-press paper by Jaffe &amp; Backer we calculate the spectrum of the stochastic background of gravitational radiation from the coalescence of Massive Black Holes throughout the low redshift universe. In the recent thesis work of Lommen the observational upper limit on the energy density in the stochastic background of gravitational radiation at nanoHertz frequencies is lowered by an order of magnitude. This limit places an observational bound on the very uncertain merger history of galaxies and subsequent Massive Black Hole coalescences., We report the first measurements of anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation with the Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array Receiver (ACBAR). The instrument was installed on the 2.1 m Viper telescope at the South Pole in 2001 January; the data presented here are the product of observations up to and including 2002 July. We present two deep differential maps produced by subtracting leading and trailing observations from the main field. The differential maps cover approximately 24 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of sky selected for low dust contrast. These results represent the highest signal-to-noise ratio observations of CMB anisotropy to date; in the deepest 150 GHz band map, we reached an rms of ~8.0 μK per 5' beam. The 3° extent of the maps and small beam size of the experiment allow the measurement of the CMB anisotropy power spectrum over the range l=150-3000 with resolution of Δl=150. The contributions of galactic dust and radio sources to the observed anisotropy are negligible and are removed in the analysis. The resulting power spectrum is found to be consistent with the primary anisotropy expected in a concordance ΛCDM universe., The DEEP2 redshift survey has now covered 2.5 degrees^2 of sky and obtained nearly 40,000 spectra; the survey is more than two-thirds finished. We have used three-color imaging to efficiently select galaxies with magnitude R_{AB}&lt;24.1 and redshifts in the range 0.7 &lt; Z &lt; 1.4. p &lt; observations.

Low-redshift SNe Ia () demonstrate that the Hubble expansion is linear, that H0 = 72 ± 8 km s-1 Mpc-1, and that the properties of dust in other galaxies are similar to those of dust in the Milky Way. The light curves of high-redshift (z = 0.3-1) SNe Ia are stretched in a manner consistent with the expansion of space; similarly, their spectra exhibit slower temporal evolution (by a factor of 1 + z) than those of nearby SNe Ia. The measured luminosity distances of SNe Ia as a function of redshift have shown that the expansion of the Universe is currently accelerating, probably due to the presence of repulsive dark energy such as Einsteins cosmological constant (). From about 200 SNe Ia, we find that H0t0 = 0.96 ± 0.04, and OHgr Lambda - 1.4 OHgr M = 0.35 ± 0.14. Combining our data with the results of large-scale structure surveys, we find a best fit for OHgr M and OHgr Lambda of 0.28 and 0.72, respectively, essentially identical to the recent WMAP results (and having comparable precision). The sum of the densities, 1.0, agrees with extensive measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation, including WMAP, and coincides with the value predicted by most inflationary models for the early Universe: the Universe is flat on large scales. A number of possible systematic effects (dust, supernova evolution) thus far do not seem to eliminate the need for OHgr Lambda &gt; 0. However, during the past few years some very peculiar low-redshift SNe Ia have been discovered, and we must be mindful of possible systematic effects if such objects are more abundant at high redshifts. Recently, analyses of SNe Ia at z = 1.0-1.7 provide further support for current acceleration, and give tentative evidence for an early epoch of deceleration. The dynamical age of the Universe is estimated to be 13.1 ± 1.5 Gyr, consistent with the ages of globular star clusters and with the WMAP result of 13.7 ± 0.2 Gyr. Current projects include the search for additional SNe Ia at z &gt; 1 to confirm the early deceleration, and the measurement of a few hundred SNe Ia at z = 0.2+/-0.8 to more accurately determine the equation of state of the dark energy, w = P/(rgr c2), whose value is now constrained by SNe Ia to be in the range $-1.48 ≲ w ≲ -0.72 at 95% confidence., I review the use of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) for cosmological distance determinations. Low-redshift SNe Ia (z &lt;∼0.1) demonstrate that the Hubble expansion is linear, that H<SUB>0</SUB> = 65 ±2 (statistical) km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>, and that the properties of dust in other galaxies are similar to those of dust in the Milky Way. The light curves of high-redshift (z = 0.3--1) SNe Ia are stretched in a manner consistent with the expansion of space; similarly, their spectra exhibit slower temporal evolution (by a factor of 1 + z) than those of nearby SNe Ia. The measured luminosity distances of SNe Ia as a function of redshift have shown that the expansion of the Universe is currently accelerating, probably due to the presence of repulsive dark energy such as Einstein's cosmological constant (Λ). Combining our data with existing measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation and with the results of large-scale structure surveys, we find a best fit for Ω<SUB>m</SUB> and Ω<SUB>Λ</SUB> of about 0.3 and 0.7, respectively. Other studies (e.g., masses of clusters of galaxies) also suggest that Ω<SUB>m</SUB> ≅ 0.3. The sum of the densities, ∼1.0, agrees with the value predicted by most inflationary models for the early Universe: the Universe is flat on large scales. A number of possible systematic effects (dust, supernova evolution) thus far do not seem to eliminate the need for Ω<SUB>Λ</SUB> &gt; 0. Most recently, analyses of SNe Ia at z = 1.0-1.7 provide further support for current acceleration, and give tentative evidence for an early epoch of deceleration. Current projects include the search for additional SNe Ia at z &gt; 1 to confirm the early deceleration, and the measurement of a few hundred SNe Ia at z = 0.2-0.8 to determine the equation of state of the dark energy, w = P/(ρ c<SUP>2</SUP>)., The interaction of Titan's ionosphere with the Saturn's magnetospheric plasma was found to be subsonic, superAlfvénic and submagnetosonic. However, the plasma conditions along Titan's orbit are highly variable [cf. J. Geophys. Res., 87 (1982) 881; Ph.D Dissertation, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 2001] resulting in a wide range of possible Mach numbers for the interaction. We consider the effect Titan would have on the ambient (or magnetospheric) ion population during a supermagnetosonic interaction, which might occur in the outer magnetosphere. The trajectories of several thousand ions in the vicinity of Titan are calculated using the fields from the output of a three-dimensional MHD model of Titan's plasma interaction. We have simulated the Voyager Plasma Spectrometer (PLS) response to the ambient ions using the determined ion trajectories. These results are compared with the Voyager distribution functions in order to illustrate how upstream conditions might affect the observed distributions, as will likely be observed during the Cassini mission Titan flybys., Combined with X-ray imaging and spectral data, observations of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) can be used to determine direct distances to galaxy clusters. These distances are independent of the extragalactic distance ladder and do not rely on clusters being standard candles or rulers. Observations of the SZE have progressed from upper limits to high signal-to-noise ratio detections and imaging of the SZE. SZE/X-ray determined distances to galaxy clusters are beginning to trace out the theoretical angular-diameter distance relation. The current ensemble of 41 SZE/X-ray distances to galaxy clusters imply a Hubble constant of H<SUB>0</SUB> ≅ 61 ±3 ±18km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>, where the uncertainties are statistical followed by systematic at 68% confidence. With a sample of high-redshift galaxy clusters, SZE/X-ray distances can be used to measure the geometry of the Universe.","['2009AGUFMSM12A..01O', '2009AGUFMSH31A1474L', '2009AGUFMSM41B1727H',

The proposed observations will confirm the binarity of the system, measure the physical separation of the two components, provide a robust spectral type estimate for the T dwarf secondary, and enable the mass ratio of the system to be determined. As a late-L/mid-T binary, the components straddle the poorly understood ""L/T transition"" where a brightening of T dwarfs at J-band is observed compared to the comparatively warmer L dwarfs. In addition to testing theories for this brightening, these data will put strong constraints on substellar evolution and formation models.",['2004hst..prop10247C'],"[('dwarf', 6), ('system', 3), ('observation', 2), ('binary', 2), ('component', 2), ('brightening', 2), ('propose', 1), ('make', 1), ('unequivocal', 1), ('resolved', 1)]","[(('propose', 'make'), 1), (('make', 'unequivocal'), 1), (('unequivocal', 'resolved'), 1), (('resolved', 'observation'), 1), (('observation', 'brown'), 1), (('brown', 'dwarf'), 1), (('dwarf', 'binary'), 1), (('binary', 'system'), 1), (('system', 'comprised'), 1), (('comprised', 'dwarf'), 1)]","[(('propose', 'make', 'unequivocal'), 1), (('make', 'unequivocal', 'resolved'), 1), (('unequivocal', 'resolved', 'observation'), 1), (('resolved', 'observation', 'brown'), 1), (('observation', 'brown', 'dwarf'), 1), (('brown', 'dwarf', 'binary'), 1), (('dwarf', 'binary', 'system'), 1), (('binary', 'system', 'comprised'), 1), (('system', 'comprised', 'dwarf'), 1), (('comprised', 'dwarf', 'dwarf'), 1)]",Dirty

During their growth phase, supermassive black holes are readily visible as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). The morphologies of AGN host galaxies offer a powerful, direct probe of the AGN-galaxy connection. We are carrying out morphological analysis of large AGN samples from deep multi-wavelength surveys, comparing the results to well-selected samples of inactive galaxies. To interpret the results properly requires understanding the observational bias introduced by the central point source, which can hide compact features and thus influence the extracted AGN host morphological parameters. Therefore, we performed extensive simulations, involving a variety of galaxy types over a range of redshifts. Here we present results of these simulations and describe preliminary work on deep HST ACS images from the COSMOS field. <P />We gratefully acknowledge support from HST grants AR-10689.01-A and GO-09822.09-A, and Yale University., The WIYN Observatory currently operates a prototype orthogonal transfer CCD array camera called OPTIC. During fall 2006, a next generation OTCCD camera, QUOTA, will begin commissioning as a pathfinder toward the implementation of a one-degree OTCCD camera (the One-Degree ImagerODI) to be on-line at WIYN in 2009. Orthogonal transfer CCD arrays use rapid readout of a set of guide stars to perform on-chip tip/tilt corrections. The use of OTCCDs allow tip-tilt correction over the entire focal plane, not simply a small central area. Images of the guide stars are obtained at rates as fast as 100Hz although 20-30 Hz is typical. These guide star images are often seen as scientifically uninteresting, as mere tools to get the best possible image quality for the scientific object. The Serendipity project will make use of the guide star video images to study bright star stellar variability without any loss of telescope time. We have developed a method to perform real-time photometry of the guide star image streams, providing a light curve of the guide star and allowing the destruction of the video files, saving time and storage space. In this paper we outline OTCCDs at WIYN, describe our photometric methods, and explore the science possibilities offered by the WIYN Serendipity Project., Deep multiwavelength surveys reveal that most Active Galactic Nuclei are obscured by moderate to high column densities of gas and dust, as suggested also by local AGN Unification and the spectral shape of the X-ray ``background.” This implies large numbers of hard X-ray sources that are missed by current, mid-range X-ray observations but will easily be found with EXIST. Incorporating the latest results on the luminosity and redshift dependence of the obscured fraction, we describe the expected 10-100 keV number counts of AGN and highlight the contributions that EXIST, as well as earlier missions like INTEGRAL, Swift, NuSTAR, and GLAST, will make to understanding cosmic black hole growth. <P />This work was supported by the Centro de Astrofisica FONDAP and NASA/INTEGRAL grant NNG05GM79G., The Multiwavelength Survey by Yale-Chile (MUSYC) consists of deep UBVRIzJHK+NB5000 coverage of 1.2 square degrees comprised of four fields. Satellite coverage includes Spitzer-IRAC+MIPS, HST-ACS, GALEX, XMM and Chandra. Multi-object spectroscopy has been obtained with Magellan+IMACS, VLT+VIMOS, and Gemini+GNIRS. MUSYC has used these data to investigate Lyman Alpha Emitters, Lyman break galaxies, Distant red galaxies, Damped Lyman alpha absorption systems, and AGN in the same volume of the universe in order to separate physical properties from selection effects. We have shown that Lyman Alpha Emitters at z=3.1 are predominantly dimmer than the R&lt;25.5 Lyman break galaxies but have similar blue continuua, little dust, average star formation rates of 6 M_sun/yr and an average stellar mass of 5x10^8 M_sun (Gawiser et al. 2006, ApJ 642, L13). Only 2% of these objects show evidence for AGN via X-ray emission or high-ionization emission lines. We will also present other properties of the Lyman Alpha Emitters, including their space density, luminosity function, cosmic star formation rate density, correlation function and dark matter halo mass. A data release of images and catalogs is available at http://www.astro.yale.edu/MUSYC . <P />We gratefully acknowledge support from NSF grants 00-71238, 01-37927 and HST AR10324.01A, Yale University, and Fundacion Andes. EG and JF acknowledge the support of NSF Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowships., Using Spitzer far-infrared (FIR) and Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) imaging as part of the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey, we study how the FIR-radio correlation behaves within a sample of spirals. Specifically, we test a phenomenological model which describes the FIR-correlation as the result of massive star formation; massive stars both dust and end their lives as supernovae whose remnants accelerate cosmic-ray (CR) electrons responsible for the observed synchrotron emission within star-forming galaxies. Since the mean-free-path of dust-heating photons is significantly shorter than the diffusion length of CR-electrons, the radio image of a galaxy should appear as a smoother version of its infrared image. We find that this description works well as smoothing the infrared maps improves the spatial correlation between the FIR and radio maps by a factor of 3. We also find that the size of the scale-length which yields the best correlation between the FIR and radio spatial distributions is related to the amount of ongoing star formation activity. We demonstrate that this trend is not the result of increased Inverse Compton losses nor a decrease in the mean-free-path traveled by CR-electrons due to varying ISM parameters, but rather due to the predominant youth of the CR-electron population within galaxies having high star-formation activity. We conclude that these galaxies have likely undergone a recent episode of enhanced star formation., From working as one of Harlan J. Smith's female calculators in 1928 to running Maria Mitchell Observatory in 1957 to being an emeritus research scientist at Yale University today, Dr. Dorrit Hoffleit has been a professional woman in astronomy for 78 years and an astronomy lover for a century. She has faced both accolades, starting with the Carolyn Wilby Prize in 1938 for her dissertation work, as well as discrimination, most notably being hired at the Aberdeen Proving Ground at a sub-professional rating during WWII. Through both good and bad, she kept her eye on the stars, and her focus on doing the best work she could. In this presentation, Dr. Hoffleit reflects on her experiences and her inspirations in an video-interview. Additionally, archival film provided by the AAVSO will be shown., The first stars in the Universe initiated cosmic metal enrichment and the reionization of the IGM, so their detailed properties are of great interest to cosmology generally. Thanks to current and future surveys of metal-poor stars in the Local Group, we need not await JWST to test theories of star formation from primordial and very low-metallicity gas. Existing data indicates that the characteristic mass of the first stars was 10 Msun, higher than in the solar neighborhood but smaller than the &gt;100 Msun predictions of recent numerical simulations. Recent discoveries of peculiar abundances in the lowest metallicity stars constitute evidence that the stellar mass function changes smoothly with metallicity and/or time. This contribution will survey the data now available and expected from future surveys and describe the theoretical framework being developed to turn these new data on metal-poor stars into detailed empirical knowledge of the first generations of stars in the Universe. This new theoretical technique calculates chemical evolution for the first time in the fully hierarchical and stochastic context of early galaxy formation. It thus provides a robust, flexible, and fast approach to testing models of primordial star formation against the only data presently available that can constrain them., The Palomar-QUEST Survey is undertaking a search for very high-redshift quasars. The survey currently covers 15,000 square degrees a minimum of two times in each of 2 filter sets: Johnson UBRI and Gunn rizz. A single scan reaches a depth of mag 20.8 in Johnson I and 19.6 in Gunn z. We have coadded data over our entire survey area in order to find quasars with Gunn z past mag 20. The coadd typically includes four passes in each filter set. We are searching for objects that are bright only in Johnson I and Gunn z, our reddest filters. This will yield quasars with redshift greater than roughly 5.8. Specifically, we target objects with Gunn i-z &gt; 2.2 and Johnson R-I &gt; 3.0. L and T dwarfs have similar optical colors to high-redshift quasars; to remove these we obtain follow-up data in the J band, where the dwarfs are very bright but the quasars are faint. Furthermore, we use an artificial neural network to separate point-like from extended objects. <P />Currently we are conducting a systematic quasar search over more than 10,000 square degrees of our survey area., The nearby Virgo Cluster provides an ideal laboratory to study galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-cluster interactions at a level of detail impossible at higher redshift. In Virgo, there exists a large population of spiral galaxies with mostly undisturbed stellar disks, but truncated gas disks. We present results of an observational study of several of these galaxies, utilizing optical and UV imaging, HI observations and optical spectroscopy. By combining optical spectroscopy and UV imaging, we are able to constrain the time since star formation ended in the outer disk and, therefore, constrain the time since the galaxies were stripped. Our results show that there is a correlation between the time since the end of star formation and the morphologies of the neutral hydrogen gas, in the sense that the outer disks of galaxies with asymmetric HI distributions have only recently stopped forming stars. In the case of the stripped spiral NGC 4522, we find evidence that a modest starburst occurred at the time of stripping, suggesting that stripping events can briefly increase the star formation rate. Finally, while most of the galaxies in our sample are consistent with being stripped near the cluster center, several show evidence for being stripped well outside the core, suggesting that the ""reach"" of the intracluster medium is greater than is suggested by simple ICM models., I present results from a spectroscopic monitoring program of B and Be stars in the open cluster NGC 3766. From a 4-year time baseline of photometric and spectroscopic data, I have identified 9 Be stars in the cluster that have undergone disk outbursts or whose disks have disappeared. Using Kurucz ATLAS9 model spectra to measure temperatures, gravities, rotational velocities, and abundances among the cluster members, I present preliminary results of the stellar and cluster properties that may affect the long term variability of Be stars. M.V.M. is supported by an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship under award AST-0401460., Before reionization, the intergalactic medium (IGM) may have been sufficiently cold for low-mass ``minihalos'' to condense out of the gas and subsequently affect reionization. Previous work has shown that minihalos generate reasonably large 21 cm fluctuations. Here we consider this signal in its proper cosmological context and show that isolating minihalos from the rest of the IGM is extremely difficult. Using the well-known halo model, we compute the power spectrum of 21 cm fluctuations from minihalos and show that the signal decreases rapidly as feedback increases the Jeans mass. We then show that even a small Lyα background increases the 21 cm fluctuations of the diffuse IGM well beyond those of the minihalos; because the mass fraction in the IGM is much larger, minihalos will lie buried within the IGM signal. The distinctive signatures of nonlinear bias and minihalo structure emerge only at much smaller scales, well beyond the resolution of any upcoming instrument. Using simple but representative reionization histories, we then show that the required Lyα background level is most likely achieved at z&gt;~15, while minihalos are still rare, so that they are almost always degenerate with the diffuse IGM., We study how present data probe standard and non-standard properties of neutrinos and the possible existence of new light particles, freely streaming or interacting, among themselves or with neutrinos. Our results include: \sum m_\nu \lt 0.40~\mathrm <P />{eV} at 99.9% C.L.; that extra massless particles have abundance ΔN<SUB>ν</SUB> = 2 ± 1 if freely streaming and ΔN<SUB>ν</SUB> = 0 ± 1.3 if interacting; that three interacting neutrinos are disfavoured at about 4σ. We investigate the robustness of our results by fitting different subsets of data. We developed our own cosmological computational tools, somewhat different from the standard ones., The possible existence of strangelets has been hypothesized for a long time but has not been confirmed experimentally. Our experiment aims to search for strangelets in lunar soil samples, where the predicted concentration of one oxygen strangelet per 10<SUP>16</SUP> 10<SUP>17</SUP> normal oxygen atoms is 10<SUP>4</SUP> times higher than that on earth. The tandem Van-de-Graaff accelerator at Yale is used as an atomic mass spectrometer to separate possible strangelets from normal nuclei. By exploiting the strangelets' signature low charge to mass ratio, our own designed detection system can identify strangelets at a sensitivity level of better than 1 per 10<SUP>17</SUP> atoms., IRS Spectra of GOODS AGN <P />Infrared emission from AGN comes from dust heated by black hole accretion and/or star-formation. Separating the contributions in optical/UV light can be difficult, particularly when obscuration is high; mid-infrared spectra are less affected by obscuration and thus offer diagnostics of the underlying power source(s). We present Spitzer IRS spectra of 10 IR-bright, hard X-ray-selected AGN from the GOODS-North field, spanning the redshift range 0.485&lt;z&lt;2.005. Spectra were obtained with the deep Long and Short-Low modules, in exposures of 4-8 hours duration, resulting in a S/N ratio of 8-10 per pixel. The observed PAH features, silicate absorption, and infrared continua offer clues to distinguish reprocessed torus emission from the stellar-heated dust component. Combining with extensive GOODS imaging data at radio, sub-mm, infrared, optical and X-ray wavelengths, we place limits on the star-formation rates, Eddington ratios, and bolometric luminosities of the sample, and compare with lower-redshift samples to probe the evolution of the dust-enshrouded phase of AGN activity. <P />This work was supported by NASA JPL/Spitzer grant RSA 177278. This work is based on observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with NASA. Support for this work was provided by NASA JPL/Spitzer grant RSA 177278., With its ability to do deep all-sky monitoring and with its extended hard X-ray energy response, EXIST will be an ideal partner for ground-based and space-based gamma-ray telescopes such as HESS, VERITAS, and GLAST. Simultaneous gamma-ray/EXIST observations of blazars will place strong constraints on the emission mechanisms and physical conditions in blazars, which have proven more complex and extreme than previously thought. If we can understand in detail the origin of blazar emission, we should be able to predict a blazar's intrinsic gamma-ray spectrum. Knowing this spectrum has important implications for cosmology since sufficiently energetic gamma-rays pair can produce on the cosmic infrared background and are effectively absorbed. A comparison of a blazar's observed and intrinsic spectrum constrains the amount of absorption that occurred, ie., it limits the intensity of the cosmic infrared background which in turn constrains when and how much star formation activity occurred in the universe., The Supernova Acceleration Probe (SNAP) mission proposes to use 36 charged coupled devices (CCDs) for the optical imaging. Each device is now envisioned to have 3512 x 3512 pixels 10.5 microns square each, with each CCD being approximately 40mm x 40mm x 200 um in size. The CCDs will have to be packaged to be suitable for mounting on the SNAP Silicon Carbide focal plane. The packages will have to be four side buttable and be stable over a temperature range of +50 degrees C to -150 degrees C, maintaining a flatness and thickness tolerance of 10 microns or less over this temperature range. The packages will be mounted on silicon carbide pedestals to match the coefficient of thermal expansion of the pedestals to both the silicon CCDs and the silicon carbide focal plane. The current design and progress on prototype packages will be described., Context: .While moving magnetic features have been studied extensively at the photospheric level, the effect they have on the upper atmosphere remains largely unknown, and it is this which we seek to address in this work.<BR /> Aims: .In this work we aim to investigate the chromospheric and transition-region dynamics associated with a moving magnetic monopole by using spectral time-series and images.<BR /> Methods: .Cross correlation was applied to images taken by different instruments and at different times in order to spatially correlate brightenings seen at transition region temperatures with moving magnetic features seen in magnetograms. We used wavelet analysis to examine and compare the periodicities of time-series signals in different regions.<BR /> Results: .Oscillations with a multitude of frequencies are found in the chromospheric and transition-region brightenings associated with a moving magnetic monopole. The region of the brightenings shows a tendency to be blue-shifted when compared to the average motion of the entire field of view. The results indicate the presence of waves and/or flows carrying energy from the monopole to the higher atmosphere.<BR /> Conclusions: .We studied the influence of a moving magnetic monopole, as recorded by magnetograms, up to transition region temperatures. This suggests that the magnetic monopole, despite being small, can influence dynamics in the upper atmospheric layers., A model for the combined long-term cycles of carbon and sulfur has been constructed which combines all the factors modifying weathering and degassing of the GEOCARB III model [Berner R.A., Kothavala Z., 2001.

Modeling atmospheric O <SUB>2</SUB> over Phanerozoic time. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta65, 685-694]. New isotopic data for both carbon and sulfur are used and new feedbacks are created by combining the models. Sensitivity analysis is done by determining (1) the effect on weathering rates of using rapid recycling (rapid recycling treats carbon and sulfur weathering in terms of young rapidly weathering rocks and older more slowly weathering rocks); (2) the effect on O <SUB>2</SUB> of using different initial starting conditions; (3) the effect on O <SUB>2</SUB> of using different data for carbon isotope fractionation during photosynthesis and alternative values of oceanic δ<SUP>13</SUP>C for the past 200 million years; (4) the effect on sulfur isotope fractionation and on O <SUB>2</SUB> of varying the size of O <SUB>2</SUB> feedback during sedimentary pyrite formation; (5) the effect on O <SUB>2</SUB> of varying the dependence of organic matter and pyrite weathering on tectonic uplift plus erosion, and the degree of exposure of coastal lands by sea level change; (6) the effect on CO <SUB>2</SUB> of adding the variability of volcanic rock weathering over time [Berner, R.A., 2006. Inclusion of the weathering of volcanic rocks in the GEOCARBSULF model. Am. J. Sci.306 (in press)]. Results show a similar trend of atmospheric CO <SUB>2</SUB> over the Phanerozoic to the results of GEOCARB III, but with some differences during the early Paleozoic and, for variable volcanic rock weathering, lower CO <SUB>2</SUB> values during the Mesozoic. Atmospheric oxygen shows a major broad late Paleozoic peak with a maximum value of about 30% O <SUB>2</SUB> in the Permian, a secondary less-broad peak centered near the Silurian/Devonian boundary, variation between 15% and 20% O <SUB>2</SUB> during the Cambrian and Ordovician, a very sharp drop from 30% to 15% O <SUB>2</SUB> at the Permo-Triassic boundary, and a more-or less continuous rise in O <SUB>2</SUB> from the late Triassic to the present., Because of the high water solubility in wadsleyite and ringwoodite, the mantle transition zone is possibly a large water reservoir. The potentially high water content of the Earth's mantle transition zone is a key element of several global mantle dynamic models. Nevertheless, to keep the transition zone relatively wet, the tendency for convection to distribute water over the entire mantle has to be offset by other mechanisms. One such mechanism could be linked to the dehydration of the slab. Studies of slab dehydration mainly focus on hydrous minerals phase diagrams that provide the depth of water exsolution. In this study, we investigate the water diffusion process that occurs prior to such exsolution. The diffusion process is controlled by both chemical gradients and thermal gradients via the temperature dependence of water solubility. We have addressed how this diffusion phenomenon influences slab water transport into the transition zone by developing a theoretical model of coupled thermal and chemical diffusion in a flat lying slab stalled in the transition zone. Model solutions demonstrate that even if intrinsic water solubility is decreasing with increasing temperature (which normally would act to impede a chemical diffusion from the slab), the water concentration profile adjusts to reduce the adverse effects of temperature-dependent solubility. The self-adjustment entails the concentration of water reaching a local maximum below the top edge of the stagnant slab; under specific conditions, this concentration maximum can reach the solubility limit and thus exsolve fluid (i.e. create of hydrous melt or aqueous silicate fluid). Consequently, model water flux computations are relatively independent of solubility variation and indicate that much of the water flux introduced by relatively well hydrated slabs is taken up into the transition zone by diffusion., Palaeomagnetism of climatically sensitive sedimentary rock types, such as glacial deposits and evaporites, can test the uniformitarianism of ancient geomagnetic fields and palaeoclimate zones. Proterozoic glacial deposits laid down in near-equatorial palaeomagnetic latitudes can be explained by `snowball Earth' episodes, high orbital obliquity or markedly non-uniformitarian geomagnetic fields. Here I present a global palaeomagnetic compilation of the Earth's entire basin-scale evaporite record. Magnetic inclinations are consistent with low orbital obliquity and a geocentric-axial-dipole magnetic field for most of the past two billion years, and the snowball Earth hypothesis accordingly remains the most viable model for low-latitude Proterozoic ice ages. Efforts to reconstruct Proterozoic supercontinents are strengthened by this demonstration of a consistently axial and dipolar geomagnetic reference frame, which itself implies stability of geodynamo processes on billion-year timescales., We re-examine scattering of photons near the Lyα resonance in the intergalactic medium (IGM). We first derive a general integral solution for the radiation field around resonance within the usual Fokker-Planck approximation. Our solution shows explicitly that recoil and spin diffusivity source an absorption feature, whose magnitude increases with the relative importance of recoil compared to Doppler broadening. This spectrum depends on the Lyα line profile, but approximating it with the absorption profile appropriate to the Lorentzian wings of natural broadening accurately reproduces the results for a full Voigt profile so long as the IGM temperature is less than ~1000K. This approximation allows us to obtain simple analytic formulae for the total scattering rate of Lyα photons and the accompanying energy exchange rate. Our power series solutions converge rapidly for photons that redshift into the Lyα resonance as well as for photons injected at line centre. We confirm previous calculations showing that heating through this mechanism is quite slow and probably negligible compared to other sources. We then show that energy exchange during the scattering of higher-order Lyman-series photons can be much more important than naively predicted by recoil arguments. However, the resulting heating is still completely negligible., Using data obtained for 12 galaxies as part of the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS) and the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) SINGS radio continuum survey, we study how star formation activity affects the far-infrared-radio correlation within galaxies by testing a phenomenological model that describes the radio image as a smeared version of the far-infrared image. The physical basis of this description is that cosmic-ray (CR) electrons will diffuse measurably farther than the mean free path of dust-heating photons before decaying by synchrotron radiation. This description works well in general. Galaxies with higher infrared surface brightnesses have best-fit smoothing scale lengths of a few hundred parsecs, substantially shorter than those for lower surface brightness galaxies. We interpret this result to suggest that galaxies with higher disk-averaged star formation rates have had a recent episode of enhanced star formation and are characterized by a higher fraction of young CR electrons that have traveled only a few hundred parsecs from their acceleration sites in supernova remnants compared to galaxies with lower star formation activity., The lack of an observed supernova associated with GRB 060614 appears to require a new paradigm for the formation of (a subset of) long-duration GRBs. This requirement is based on the presumed low redshift of the burst, which was inferred from the spatial coincidence of the afterglow with a z=0.125 galaxy. We explore the possibility that this low-redshift galaxy is a chance superposition along the line of sight to GRB 060614. We examine the galaxy distribution of the field of GRB 060614 and find that the probability of a chance association with a galaxy at least as bright as the putative host is only ~0.5%-1.9%. However, for the current ensemble of ~180 Swift GRBs, it is likely that several such coincidences have occurred, and given the ``nonstandard'' nature of GRB 060614 it is not implausible that this is one such occurrence. Thus, the conclusion that GRB 060614 requires a revision to the formation paradigm for long-duration GRBs should be approached with caution., The kinematical properties of the Galactic thick disk are studied using absolute proper motions from the Third Yale/San Juan Southern Proper Motion Catalog and Two Micron All Sky Survey near-infrared photometry for a sample of ~1200 red giants in the direction of the south Galactic pole. The photometrically selected sample is dominated by thick-disk stars, as indicated by the number-density distribution that varies with distance from the Galactic plane as a single-valued exponential over the range 1 kpc&lt;z&lt;4 kpc. The inferred scale height of the thick disk is 0.783+/-0.048 kpc. The kinematics of the sample are also consistent with disklike motion. The U-velocity component is roughly constant, reflecting the Sun's peculiar motion, while a considerable shear is seen in the mean rotational velocity, V. The V-velocity profile's dependence on z is linear, with a gradient of dV/dz=-30+/-3 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> kpc<SUP>-1</SUP>. The velocity dispersions in both U and V show a lesser gradient of about 9+/-3 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> kpc<SUP>-1</SUP>. We demonstrate that the derived velocity and velocity-dispersion profiles are consistent with the assumptions of dynamical equilibrium and reasonable models of the overall Galactic potential., We describe a high-precision, deep (to V~19-21), absolute proper-motion survey that samples ~50 lines of sight in the Kapteyn selected areas along declination zones -15°, 0°, and 15°. In many fields the astrometric baseline reaches nearly a century. We demonstrate that these data provide typical per star precisions between ~1 and 3 mas yr<SUP>-1</SUP> to the above magnitude limits, with the absolute reference frame established by numerous extragalactic sources in each survey field. Combined with existing and ongoing photometric and radial velocity surveys in these fields, these astrometric data will enable, among other things, accurate detailed dynamical modeling of satellite interactions with our Galaxy. In this contribution we describe the astrometric part of our survey and show preliminary results along the trailing tail of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, and in the Monoceros Ring region., Gravitational lensing of a background source by a foreground galaxy lens occasionally produces four images of the source. The cusp and the fold relations impose conditions on the ratios of magnifications of these four-image lenses. In this theoretical investigation, we explore the sensitivity of these relations to the presence of substructure in the lens. Starting with a smooth lens potential, we add varying amounts of substructure, while keeping the source position fixed, and find that the fold relation is a more robust indicator of substructure than the cusp relation for the images. This robustness is independent of the detailed spatial distribution of the substructure, as well as of the ellipticity of the lensing potential and the presence of external shear., In this essay we introduce a theoretical framework designed to describe black hole dynamics. The difficulties in understanding such dynamics stems from the proliferation of scales involved when one attempts to simultaneously describe all of the relevant dynamical degrees of freedom. These range from the modes that describe the black hole horizon, which are responsible for dissipative effects, to the long wavelength gravitational radiation that drains mechanical energy from macroscopic black hole bound states. We approach the problem from a Wilsonian point of view, by building a tower of theories of gravity each of which is valid at different scales. The methodology leads to multiple new results in diverse topics including phase transitions of Kaluza-Klein black holes and the interactions of spinning black hole in non-relativistic orbits. Moreover, our methods tie together speculative ideas regarding dualities for black hole horizons to real physical measurements in gravitational wave detectors., The radiation background produced by the 21 cm spin-flip transition of neutral hydrogen at high redshifts can be a pristine probe of fundamental physics and cosmology. At z∼30 300, the intergalactic medium (IGM) is visible in 21 cm absorption against the cosmic microwave background (CMB), with a strength that depends on the thermal (and ionization) history of the IGM. Here we examine the constraints this background can place on dark matter decay and annihilation, which could heat and ionize the IGM through the production of high-energy particles. Using a simple model for dark matter decay, we show that, if the decay energy is immediately injected into the IGM, the 21 cm background can detect energyinjectionrates≳10<SUP>-24</SUP>eVcm<SUP>-3</SUP>sec<SUP>-1</SUP>. If all the dark matter is subject to decay, this allows us to constrain darkmatterlifetimes≲10<SUP>27</SUP>sec. Such energy injection rates are much smaller than those typically probed by the CMB power spectra. The expected brightness temperature fluctuations at z∼50 are a fraction of a mK and can vary from the standard calculation by up to an order of magnitude, although the difference can be significantly smaller if some of the decay products free stream to lower redshifts. For self-annihilating dark matter, the fluctuation amplitude can differ by a factor≲2 from the standard calculation at z∼50. Note also that, in contrast to the CMB, the 21 cm probe is sensitive to both the ionization fraction and the IGM temperature, in principle allowing better constraints on the decay process and heating history. We also show that strong IGM heating and ionization can lead to an enhanced H<SUB>2</SUB> abundance, which may affect the earliest generations of stars and galaxies., Aims.We present the results of a detailed analysis of 452 ground-based, high-resolution high S/N spectroscopic measurements spread over 4.5 years for β Canis Majoris with the aim of determining the pulsational characteristics of this star, and then using them to derive seismic constraints on the stellar parameters.<BR /> Methods: .We determined pulsation frequencies in the Si III 4553 Å line with Fourier methods. We identified the m-value of the modes by taking the photometric identifications of the degrees ℓ into account. To this end we used the moment method together with the amplitude and phase variations across the line profile. The frequencies of the identified modes were used for a seismic interpretation of the structure of the star.<BR /> Results: .We confirm the presence of the three pulsation frequencies already detected in previous photometric datasets: f<SUB>1</SUB> = 3.9793~c d<SUP>-1</SUP> (46.057~μHz), f<SUB>2</SUB> = 3.9995~c d<SUP>-1</SUP> (46.291~μHz), and f<SUB>3</SUB> = 4.1832~c d<SUP>-1</SUP> (48.417~μHz). For the two modes with the highest amplitudes, we unambiguously identify (ℓ_1,m_1) = (2,2) and (ℓ_2,m_2) = (0,0). We cannot conclude anything for the third mode identification, except that m<SUB>3</SUB> &gt; 0. We also deduce an equatorial rotational velocity of 31 ± 5~km s<SUP>-1</SUP> for the star. We show that the mode f<SUB>1</SUB> must be close to an avoided crossing. Constraints on the mass (13.5 ± 0.5~μHz), age (12.4 ± 0.7 Myr), and core overshoot (0.20 ± 0.05 H_P) of β CMa are obtained from seismic modelling using f<SUB>1</SUB> and f_2.<BR />, , , We present observations of the stripped Virgo Cluster spiral galaxy NGC 4522, a clear, nearby example of a galaxy currently undergoing interstellar medium-intracluster medium (ISM-ICM) stripping. Utilizing SparsePak integral field spectroscopy on the Wisconsin-Indiana-Yale-NOAO (WIYN) 3.5 m telescope and Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) UV photometry, we present an analysis of the outer disk (r&gt;3 kpc) stellar population of this galaxy, beyond the H I and Hα truncation radius. We find that the star formation in the gas-stripped outer disk ceased very recently, ~100 Myr ago, in agreement with previous claims that this galaxy is currently being stripped. At the time of this stripping, data and models suggest that the galaxy experienced a modest starburst. The stripping is occurring in a region of the cluster well outside the cluster core, likely because this galaxy is experiencing extreme conditions from a dynamic ICM due to an ongoing subcluster merger. The outer disk has a spectrum of a K+A galaxy, traditionally observed in high-redshift cluster galaxies. In the case of NGC 4522, a K+A spectrum is formed by simple stripping of the interstellar gas by the hot intracluster medium. These data show K+A spectra can be created by cluster processes and that these processes likely extend beyond the cluster core., We present first results of a spectroscopic survey targeting K-selected galaxies at z=2.0-2.7 using the Gemini near-infrared spectrograph (GNIRS). We obtained near-infrared spectra with a wavelength coverage of 1.0-2.5 μm for 26 K-bright galaxies (K&lt;19.7) selected from the Multi-wavelength Survey by Yale-Chile (MUSYC) using photometric redshifts. We successfully derived spectroscopic redshifts for all 26 galaxies using rest-frame optical emission lines or the redshifted Balmer/4000 Å break. Twenty galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts in the range 2.0&lt;z&lt;2.7, for which bright emission lines like Hα and [O III] fall in atmospheric windows. Surprisingly, we detected no emission lines for nine of these 20 galaxies. The median 2 σ upper limit on the rest-frame equivalent width of Hα for these nine galaxies is ~10 Å. The stellar continuum emission of these same nine galaxies is best fitted by evolved stellar population models. The best-fit star formation rate (SFR) is zero for five out of nine galaxies and is consistent with zero within 1 σ for the remaining four. Thus, both the Hα measurements and the independent stellar continuum modeling imply that 45% of our K-selected galaxies are not forming stars intensely. This high fraction of galaxies without detected line emission and low SFRs may imply that the suppression of star formation in massive galaxies occurs at higher redshift than is predicted by current cold dark matter (CDM) galaxy formation models. However, obscured star formation may have been missed, and deep mid-infrared imaging is needed to clarify this situation. <P />Based on observations obtained at the Gemini Observatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under a cooperative agreement with the NSF on behalf of the Gemini partnership., We present a detailed study of the small frequency separations as diagnostics of the mass of the convective core and evolutionary stage of solar-type stars. We demonstrate how the small separations can be combined to provide sensitive tests for the presence of convective overshoot at the edge of the core. These studies are focused on low-degree oscillation modes, the only modes expected to be detected in distant stars. Using simulated data with realistic errors, we find that the mass of the convective core can be estimated to within 5 per cent if the total stellar mass is known. Systematic errors arising due to uncertainty in the mass could be up to 20 per cent. The evolutionary stage of the star, determined in terms of the central hydrogen abundance using our proposed technique, however, is much less sensitive to the mass estimate., Observations of the high-redshift Universe with the 21 cm hyperfine line of neutral hydrogen promise to open an entirely new window onto the early phases of cosmic structure formation. Here we review the physics of the 21 cm transition, focusing on processes relevant at high redshifts, and describe the insights to be gained from such observations. These include measuring the matter power spectrum at z∼50, observing the formation of the cosmic web and the first luminous sources, and mapping the reionization of the intergalactic medium. The epoch of reionization is of particular interest, because large HII regions will seed substantial fluctuations in the 21 cm background. We also discuss the experimental challenges involved in detecting this signal, with an emphasis on the Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. These increase rapidly toward low frequencies and are especially severe for the highest redshift applications. Assuming that these difficulties can be overcome, the redshifted 21 cm line will offer unique insight into the high-redshift Universe, complementing other probes but providing the only direct, three-dimensional view of structure formation from z∼200 to 6., We investigate quantitatively the extent to which having a primordial leptonic asymmetry (n<SUB>ν</SUB>≠n<SUB>ν¯</SUB>) relaxes the bounds on light sterile neutrinos imposed by BBN and LSS. We adopt a few assumptions that allow us to solve the neutrino evolution equations over a broad range of mixing parameters and asymmetries. For the general cases of sterile mixing with the electron or muon neutrino, we identify the regions that can be reopened. For the particular case of a LSND-like sterile neutrino, soon to be rejected or confirmed by MiniBooNE, we find that an asymmetry of the order of 10<SUP>-4</SUP> is needed to lift the conflicts with cosmology., A few multiplets that can be added to the SM contain a lightest neutral component which is automatically stable and provides allowed DM candidates with a non-standard phenomenology. Thanks to coannihilations, a successful thermal abundance is obtained for well defined DM masses. The best candidate seems to be a SU2<SUB></SUB> fermion quintuplet with mass 4.4 TeV, accompanied by a charged partner 166 MeV heavier with life-time 1.8 cm, that manifests at colliders as charged tracks disappearing in π<SUP></SUP> with 97.7% branching ratio. The cross section for usual NC direct DM detection is σ<SUB></SUB>=f<SUP></SUP>1.0×10<SUP></SUP> cm<SUP></SUP> where f∼1 is a nucleon matrix element. We study prospects for CC direct detection and for indirect detection., We have been monitoring Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) with the SMARTS 1.3m telescope at Cerro Tololo to determine colors, solar phase curves, and rotation periods[1]. To date we have observed the phase curves of over 30 distant bodies, including 20 TNOs, 7 Centaurs, and Nereid. Here we present observations showing that the new Pluto-sized bodies (2003 UB313, 2005 FY9, and 2003 EL61), like Pluto, all have flat phase phase curves and neutral visible colors compared with smaller TNOs. Since these large bodies, including Pluto, are known to have high albedos and reflectance spectra dominated by the presence of methane or water ice, we suggest that the flat phase curves and neutral visible colors we observe are the result of recent resurfacing. This could be caused by surface sublimation at perihelion followed by freeze out at aphelion. Smaller TNOs with similar orbits would not retain an icy covering owing to a surface gravity to weak to retain the sublimated volatiles. It follows that there is a threshold size below which TNOs will have lower albedos and redder colors owing to long-term surface weathering. <P />[1] D. Rabinowitz, B. Schaefer, and S. Tourtellote, 2006, submitted to AJ. <P />This work as supported by the NASA., We consider the evolution of the sky-averaged 21-cm background during the early phases of structure formation. Using simple analytic models, we calculate the thermal and ionization histories, assuming that stellar photons dominate the radiation background. The resulting 21-cm spectra can constrain the properties of the first generations of stars and quasars. If Population II stars dominate, Lyα coupling renders the intergalactic medium (IGM) visible before it is heated by X-rays and long before reionization. Thus the 21-cm background has a strong absorption epoch followed by weaker emission that fades during reionization. The harder spectra of very massive Population III stars compress these transitions into a shorter time interval and decreases the signal amplitude. However, the reionization epoch will remain visible except in extreme cases. The global 21-cm signal will be challenging to observe because of astronomical foregrounds, but it offers an exciting opportunity to study the first sources of light. It also fixes the overall amplitude of the fluctuating background whose detection is a major goal of several next-generation low-frequency radio interferometers., We use the Fourth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to test the ubiquity of infall patterns around galaxy clusters and measure cluster mass profiles to large radii. The Cluster and Infall Region Nearby Survey (CAIRNS) found infall patterns in nine clusters, but the cluster sample was incomplete. Here we match X-ray cluster catalogs with SDSS, search for infall patterns, and compute mass profiles for a complete sample of X-ray-selected clusters. Very clean infall patterns are apparent in most of the clusters, with the fraction decreasing with increasing redshift due to shallower sampling. All 72 clusters in a well-defined sample limited by redshift (ensuring good sampling) and X-ray flux (excluding superpositions) show infall patterns sufficient to apply the caustic technique. This sample is by far the largest sample of cluster mass profiles extending to large radii to date. Similar to CAIRNS, cluster infall patterns are better defined in observations than in simulations. Further work is needed to determine the source of this difference. We use the infall patterns to compute mass profiles for 72 clusters and compare them to model profiles. Cluster scaling relations using caustic masses agree well with those using X-ray or virial mass estimates, confirming the reliability of the caustic technique. We confirm the conclusion of CAIRNS that cluster infall regions are well fitted by Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and Hernquist profiles and poorly fitted by singular isothermal spheres. This much larger sample enables new comparisons of cluster properties with those in simulations. The shapes (specifically NFW concentrations) of the mass profiles agree well with the predictions of simulations. The mass in the infall region is typically comparable to or larger than that in the virial region. Specifically, the mass inside the turnaround radius is on average 2.19+/-0.18 times that within the virial radius. This ratio agrees well with recent predictions from simulations of the final masses of dark matter halos., Our multiwavelength analysis of the kiloparsec-scale jet in the well-known quasar 3C273 offers new clues to the controversial origin of the X-ray emission seen in many quasar jets. Spitzer IRAC 3.6 and 5.8 micron images of 3C273, combined with HST ACS, Chandra ACIS, and VLA images, show a collimated sequence of bright knots between 13"" and 23"" from the quasar core. In the infrared, as in the radio, the knots are brightest toward the far end of the jet. In contrast, the strongest X-ray emission comes from the first knot, with subsequent knots getting fainter along the jet. The spectral energy distribution of the first, X-ray-brightest knot shows clearly that the infrared emission is the high-frequency extension of the radio-synchrotron component, while at least half the optical emission from the knot is associated with the X-ray component. Given the similarity between the radio and optical polarization of 3C273 (although the latter has not yet been measured for this specific knot), the SED suggests the X-rays are produced by the synchrotron process rather than inverse-Compton scattering of CMB photons. Sensitive, spatially-resolved polarization measurements of the knot are needed to confirm this conclusion., Various X-ray binary source models imply the presence of hot, moderately relativistic protons near the accreting, compact object. The interaction of these protons with themselves and their surroundings will lead to the production of pions and eventually gamma-rays. Motivated by the upcoming GLAST mission, we re-examine and update the predictions for this gamma-ray emission and study the constraints that can be placed on X-ray binary accretion disk and coronal models by the detection (or non-detection) of the emission., In this paper, we present the first BV I CCD photometry of six overlooked old open clusters (Berkeley 44, NGC 6827, Berkeley 52, Berkeley 56, Skiff 1 and Berkeley 5) and derive estimates of their fundamental parameters by using isochrones from the Padova library. We found that all the clusters are older than the Hyades, with ages ranging from 0.8Gyr (NGC 6827 and Berkeley 5) to 4.0Gyr (Berkeley 56). The latter is one of the old open clusters with the largest heliocentric distance. <P />In the field of Skiff 1, we recognize a faint blue main sequence identical to the one found in the background of open clusters in the second and third Galactic quadrant, and routinely attributed to the Canis Major accretion event. We use the synthetic colour-magnitude diagram method and a Galactic model to show that this population can be easily interpreted as a thick disc and halo population towards Skiff 1. We finally revise the age distribution of the old open clusters, showing that the previously suggested peak at 5Gyr looses importance as additional old clusters are discovered., We have performed infrared imaging of the jet of the quasar 3C 273 at wavelengths of 3.6 and 5.8 μm with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope. When combined with the radio, optical, and X-ray measurements, the IRAC photometry of the X-ray-bright jet knots clearly shows that the optical emission is dominated by the high-energy emission component of the jet, not by the radio synchrotron component, as had been assumed to date. The high-energy component, represented by a power law from the optical through X-ray, may be due to a second synchrotron component or to inverse Compton scattering of ambient photons. In the former case, we argue that the acceleration of protons exceeding energies of E<SUB>p</SUB>~10<SUP>16</SUP> eV or possibly even to E<SUB>p</SUB>~10<SUP>19</SUP> eV would be taking place in the jet knots of 3C 273, assuming that the acceleration time is proportional to the particle gyroradius. In contrast, the inverse Compton model, into which highly relativistic Doppler beaming has to be incorporated, requires very low energy electrons of E<SUB>e</SUB>~1 MeV in the jet knots. The present polarization data in the radio and optical would favor the former interpretation in the case of the 3C 273 jet. Sensitive and detailed measurements of optical polarization are important in order to establish the radiation mechanism responsible for the high-energy emission. The present study offers new clues as to the controversial origin of the X-ray emission seen in many quasar jets., We analyse the weak (2σ) evidence for a running spectral index seen in the three year WMAP data set and its implications for single field, slow roll inflation. We assume that the running is comparable to the central value found from the WMAP data analysis, and use the Hubble slow roll formalism to follow the evolution of the slow roll parameters. For all parameter choices consistent with a large, negative running, single field, slow roll inflation lasts less than 30 e-folds after CMB scales leave the horizon. Thus, a definitive observation of a large negative running would imply that any inflationary phase requires multiple fields or the breakdown of slow roll. Alternatively, if single field, slow roll inflation sources the primordial fluctuations, we can expect the observed running to move much closer to zero as the CMB is measured more accurately at small angular scales., , The nucleus <SUP>135</SUP>Ba was investigated as a possible candidate for E(5/4), a non-trivial example of critical point symmetry in odd mass nuclei, for the case of a γ-soft liquid drop with quadrupole deformation coupled to a particle with j = 3/2. Comparison of the E(5/4), Interacting Boson-Fermion Approximation, Particle-Vibrator Coupling Model and Shell Model calculations with the data are presented., The effect of temperature on the B- to C-type fabric transition in olivine was investigated by large-strain shear deformation experiments. A new series of deformation experiments was conducted at 1273-1373 K, 2.0 GPa and strain-rates ranging from 3.8 × 10 <SUP>-4</SUP> to 3.2 × 10 <SUP>-5</SUP> s <SUP>-1</SUP> under water-saturated conditions, and combined with previous results at 1473 K, the influence of temperature on deformation fabrics was investigated. Two types of olivine fabrics were identified, one in which the olivine [0 0 1] axis is subparallel to the shear direction and the (0 1 0) plane is parallel to the shear plane (B-type), and another one in which the [0 0 1] axis is parallel to the shear direction and the (1 0 0) plane is parallel to the shear plane (C-type). The B-type olivine fabric occurs at higher stress than the C-type, but the stress magnitude at which the B- to C-type fabric transition occurs decreases significantly with decreasing temperature. The temperature dependence of the transition stress is parameterized using a range of exponential flow law that is constrained by the experimental study. When the experimental results are extrapolated to lower temperatures, the fabric transition between B- and C-type is predicted to occur at ∼1 MPa and ∼1000 K. This prediction is consistent with the olivine fabrics in naturally deformed peridotites found in plate-convergent regions. The present study indicates that when some amounts of water (&gt;200 ppm H/Si) are present, the B-type fabric will dominate in low temperature regions of the upper mantle whereas the C-type (or E-type) fabric will dominate at high temperatures. The complex seismic anisotropy in subduction zones can be explained by changes in the dominant type of olivine fabrics caused by spatial variations in physical and chemical variables, such as temperature and water content rather than by complexities in mantle wedge flow pattern., We employ a continuous theory of two-phase flow to investigate the influence of grain boundary tension on distribution and migration of melts through a viscous matrix. The 'disaggregation melt fraction', the volume fraction of partial melt at which grain boundaries are completely wetted, is crucial in determining the total interfacial force per unit volume. In partially molten aggregates with small dihedral angles and containing less melt than the disaggregation fraction, capillary action on grain boundaries tends to retain melt in tubules along triple grain junctions. As a consequence, pulses of buoyant magma decay during their ascent through the mantle. Strong interfacial tension on matrix grain boundaries also influences the thickness of a heavy partially molten layer. In aggregates with large dihedral angles, strong tension on grain-melt interfaces can give rise to self-separation of the melt from the matrix., The potential for studies of the structure, kinematics and dynamics of our Galaxy, the physical nature of stars and the cosmological distance scale is without equal in the history of astronomy. Cutting-edge areas of research are now accessible due to the dramatic increases in accuracy provided by Hipparcos, HST and the next generation of astrometric space missions such as SIM (2010) and Gaia (2011). The decadal committee in the US and the multinational ESA have both continuously placed SIM and Gaia at the top of their scientific priority list and committed to spending on the order of a billion dollars on each mission. Major improvements in detector technology such as the orthogonal-transfer arrays have significantly improved our measurement precision and large ground-based facilities will enable us to probe more deeply into the universe. These opportunities oblige us to assume responsibilities for ensuring the success of the astrometric missions and facilities and for educating astronomers to use those instruments creatively and analyze the data with rigor., , We investigate the coupled effects of mineralogy and pressure on the dynamics of axisymmetric thermochemical plumes in the lower mantle, using both high resolution numerical experiments and simple analytical theory. We focus on the effect of composition on the compressibility which has not been studied before. Our results show that the effect of mineralogy is considerable: For relatively low Si enrichment, the compressibility of the plume and of the surrounding mantle is similar therefore the compositional density excess of the plume is constant with depth. This leads to an oscillatory behavior in plume head vertical position with time, similar to previous work [A. Davaille. Simultaneous generation of hotspots and superswells by convection in a heterogeneous planetary mantle. Nature, 402 (1999) 756-760.]. Si-enriched compositions instead induce a lower compressibility for the thermochemical plume with respect to the surrounding mantle, implying an increase of the compositional density excess with decreasing depth. Therefore, although thermochemical plumes can fully develop and rise toward the surface, their ascent may be impeded by the chemical density excess, leading to the stagnation of large plume heads at various depths in the lower mantle. As a consequence, Si-enriched thermochemical plumes may display broad (∼ 1200 km wide) negative seismic velocity anomalies at various lower mantle depths, which may not necessarily be associated with upwelling currents. In addition, the coupling between mineralogy and dynamics may provide an efficient mechanism for the long term survival of compositional heterogeneity in the lower mantle., , We derive an extended version of the well-known Lyth Bound on the total variation of the inflaton field, incorporating higher-order corrections in slow roll. We connect the field variation Δphi to both the spectral index of scalar perturbations and the amplitude of tensor modes. We then investigate the implications of this bound for 'small field' potentials, where the field rolls off a local maximum of the potential. The total field variation during inflation is generically of order m<SUB>Pl</SUB>, even for potentials with a suppressed tensor/scalar ratio. Much of the total field excursion arises in the last e-fold of inflation and in single field models this problem can only be avoided via fine-tuning or the imposition of a symmetry. Finally, we discuss the implications of this result for inflationary model building in string theory and supergravity., We propose to complete near-infrared K_s-band imaging of a unique sample of 41 X-ray selected galaxy clusters at moderate to high redshift (z=0.35-0.90) with approved Chandra observations. We will measure their stellar masses and study their galaxy populations over the entire virial regions and into the infall regions. Both semi-analytic models and simulations incorporating radiative cooling and galaxy formation overpredict the stellar masses of clusters by a factor of 2-3. Our photometry will measure the stellar masses and hence the (integrated) star formation efficiency and its dependence on both redshift and cluster mass. These data will also establish cluster scaling relations and their evolution at z=0.35-0.90, robustly quantify the ``down-sizing'' effect and its dependence on mass, study the evolution of cluster galaxies from the infall regions to their cores, measure the halo occupation function and its evolution, and provide important inputs into future cluster surveys which will probe dark energy. A large, complete sample is required to test systematics in cluster scaling relations with both mass and redshift. These data will also be used to understand the history of star formation in clusters with scheduled Spitzer observations and provide efficient target selection for future spectroscopy., The Coulomb dissociation (CD) of B8 has emerged as a landmark testing ground of the very method of CD for measuring the cross section of the low-energy Be7(p,γ)B8 direct capture (DC) reaction. Recent claims of evidence of slope difference between CD and DC results are critically examined. We include all relevant RIKEN2 data and all previously published DC data, and we examine the extracted so-called average scale-independent slope (b). The parametrization used by the Seattle group to extract the so-called b-slope parameter is also examined at energies above 300 keV. Considering the physical slope (S<SUP>'</SUP>=dS/dE) above 300 keV, we observe a (1.7σ) agreement between slopes (S<SUP>'</SUP>) measured in CD and DC above 300 keV. The claim that S<SUB>17</SUB>(0) values extracted from CD data are inconsistent and lower than DC results arises from a neglect of substantial systematic uncertainty of low-energy CD data. A consideration of the published CD S<SUB>17</SUB>(0) results yields very consistent S<SUB>17</SUB>(0) values that agree with most recent DC measurements. The recent correction of the b-slope parameter suggested by Esbensen, Bertsch, and Snover (EBS) was applied to the wrong b slope calculated using part of the RIKEN2 data. When the correct slope of the RIKEN2 data is used, the EBS correction in fact leads to a substantial disagreement between the slopes of the RIKEN2 data and DC data. In spite of an agreement between CD and DC data neither allow for extracting the slope above 300 keV with high accuracy. Uncertainty of the slope (S<SUP>'</SUP>) leads to an additional uncertainty of the extrapolated S<SUB>17</SUB>(0). The slope of the astrophysical cross-section factor S<SUB>17</SUB> must be measured with high precision to enable extraction of the d/s ratio and a high-precision extrapolation of S<SUB>17</SUB>(0)., We examine the prospects for studying the pre-reionization intergalactic medium (IGM) through the so-called 21-cm forest in spectra of bright high-redshift radio sources. We first compute the evolution of the mean optical depth τ for models that include X-ray heating of the IGM gas, Wouthuysen-Field coupling, and reionization. Under most circumstances, the spin temperature T<SUB>S</SUB> grows large well before reionization begins in earnest; this occurs so long as the X-ray luminosity of high-redshift starbursts (per unit star formation rate) is comparable to that in nearby galaxies. As a result, τ &lt;~ 10<SUP>-3</SUP> throughout most of reionization, and background sources must sit well beyond the reionization surface in order to experience absorption that is measurable by square-kilometre class telescopes. HII regions produce relatively large `transmission gaps' and may therefore still be observable during the early stages of reionization. Absorption from sheets and filaments in the cosmic web fades once T<SUB>S</SUB> becomes large and should be rare during reionization. Minihaloes can produce strong (albeit narrow) absorption features. Measuring their abundance would yield useful limits on the strength of feedback processes in the IGM as well as their effect on reionization., For the case of an electric or scalar charge travelling along a timelike geodesic in a curved, background spacetime, we apply a Green's theorem argument to transform the tail contribution to the particle's self-force at a point p along its trajectory to a form which involves only an integral over the past light cone from p. One potential advantage of this reformulation is that the tail contribution to the fundamental solution for a (self-adjoint) tensor wave equation in an arbitrary spacetime is (at least within so-called causal domains) explicitly computable on the past light cone of an arbitrary point through the integration of certain linear transport equations defined along the null generators of the cone. The conventional approach to computing the self-force requires this tail field throughout the interior of the past light cone and extracts it from the particle's (numerically generated) total field through an intricate mode-by-mode numerical decomposition. By contrast, our approach requires that the particle's total field be paired with the (explicitly computable) tail field on the light cone itself and then integrated over this cone. We thus avoid the need for the aforementioned mode-by-mode decomposition of the particle's total field into direct ⊕ tail contributions. We speculate that in some circumstances it may be sufficient to truncate the particle's total field, as needed in our calculation, to its (also explicitly computable) direct Liénard Wiechert approximation., Phosphomonoesters are an important source of dissolved inorganic orthophosphate (PO <SUB>4</SUB> or P <SUB>i</SUB>), the preferred form of P utilized by microbiota and aquatic plants in marine and freshwater ecosystems. Two enzymes involved in phosphomonoester metabolism and commonly detected in natural waters (alkaline phosphatase and 5'-nucleotidase) have been studied to determine the oxygen isotope signature of P <SUB>i</SUB>-regeneration from phosphomonoesters by enzymatic degradation. Oxygen (O) isotope ratios of water and P <SUB>i</SUB> released from phosphomonoesters during enzyme hydrolysis experiments demonstrate that released P <SUB>i</SUB> incorporates one oxygen atom from water. The isotopic fractionation between this incorporated water O and ambient water O is -30 (±8)‰ for alkaline phosphatase and -10 (±1)‰ for 5'-nucleotidase, with very weak dependence on temperature. The result of these enzyme-specific isotopic fractionations at one of the four O sites in PO <SUB>4</SUB> is that the δ <SUP>18</SUP>O value of P <SUB>i</SUB> regenerated by 5'-nucleotidase is 5‰ higher than P <SUB>i</SUB> regenerated by alkaline phosphatase from the same phosphomonoester substrate. The δ <SUP>18</SUP>O value of regenerated P <SUB>i</SUB> also reflects inheritance of 75% of O from the phosphomonoester substrate, thus making the δ <SUP>18</SUP>O of phosphomonoester-derived P <SUB>i</SUB> a potential tracer of organophosphorous compound sources. Phosphomonoesterase-regenerated P <SUB>i</SUB> has a distinct phosphate oxygen isotope signature that is different and distinguishable from that of biologically recycled and subsequently equilibrated P <SUB>i</SUB> and P <SUB>i</SUB> regenerated from photooxidation of organic matter. The δ <SUP>18</SUP>O value of regenerated P <SUB>i</SUB> will correlate positively with the δ <SUP>18</SUP>O value of bulk water and the fractionation, α, between regenerated P <SUB>i</SUB> and water, α<SUB>regen Pi-water </SUB>, should converge toward equilibrium α<SUB>Pi-water</SUB> values with increased biological cycling of P <SUB>i</SUB>., We present SMARTS consortium optical/IR light curves of SN 2006aj, associated with GRB 060218. We find that this event is broadly similar to two previously observed events, SN 1998bw/GRB 980425 and SN 2003lw/GRB 031203. In particular, all of these events are greatly underluminous in gamma rays compared with typical long-duration GRBs. We find that the observation by Swift of even one such event implies a large enough true event rate to create difficulties in interpreting these events as typical GRBs observed off-axis. Thus, these events appear to be intrinsically different from and much more common than high-luminosity GRBs, which have been observed in large numbers out to a redshift of at least 6.3. The existence of a range of intrinsic energies of GRBs may present challenges to using GRBs as standard candles., Using a combination of wide-field near-infrared imaging and very deep follow-up near-infrared spectroscopy we have identified a population of massive ""red and dead"" galaxies at z~2.5. The galaxies lack emission lines and have strong Balmer/4000 Angstrom breaks, demonstrating directly that they have evolved stellar populations. These objects are very likely progenitors of massive ellipticals today and may be descendants of the first generation of galaxies. We propose to image 10 of these objects with the NIC2 camera to determine their morphologies. The goals are to 1} determine whether they have the sizes of present-day early-types or are more compact, as predicted by models, 2} determine the morphology, using visual classification and quantitative methods, and 3} constrain the evolution of the Kormendy relation from z~2.5 to the present. These observations will show whether the oldest and most massive galaxies at z~2.5 were already fully formed or still in the process of assembly., Dwarf elliptical {dE} galaxies form some of the most numerous galaxies in the universe, yet their origins remain a mystery. The most popular formation scenarios are that dEs are either ancient, primordial objects, or the recent remnants of disrupted progenitor galaxies. These scenarios predict significantly different ratios of old and intermediate age stars. Stellar population characteristics can therefore discriminate between these scenarios. Previous spectroscopic work based on line strengths has had too many uncertainties to uniquely infer the stellar populations. Resolved color magnitude diagrams are needed instead. Since dE galaxies generally do not have stars younger than 1 Gyr, resolving the main sequence turnoff is required to directly quantify the star formation histories. Only ACS on HST can reach this depth, and it can only do so for the nearest two dE galaxies in the Local Group: the M31 dE satellites NGC 147 and NGC 185. Their main sequence turnoffs are expected to be at an apparent magnitude of V=29; we request F606W/F814W imaging one half magnitude fainter than this limit {and more than four magnitudes fainter than the deepest previous dE observations}. This will quantify the ratio of old to intermediate-age stars and will allow us to discriminate between the competing models of dE formation. On-going Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy of several hundred red giant stars in each of these two dE galaxies, coupled with dynamical modeling and spectral synthesis, will complement the ACS measurement by providing information on chemical abundance patterns, dark matter content and internal dynamics. The proposed ACS data will be the first to directly quantify the onset and duration of star formation episodes in any dE galaxy. This measurement can only be done with HST/ACS, and it can only be done for these two galaxies in the dE class. This project will therefore be unique, and will be the most comprehensive study to date of any dE galaxy., Recent studies have shown that ""dry"" mergers of red, bulge-dominated galaxies at low redshift play an important role in shaping today's most massive ellipticals. These mergers have been identified in extremely deep ground-based images of red sequence galaxies at z 0.1. The ground-based images reach surface brightness limits of AB 29, but lack the resolution to study the morphologies of the galaxies inside the effective radius. Here we propose to obtain ACS images of a representative sample of 40 of these red sequence galaxies: 15 ongoing dry mergers, 15 remnants, and 10 undisturbed objects. We will measure the isophote shapes and ellipticities of the galaxies, their dust content, morphological fine structure {shells and ripples}, AGN content, and their location on the Fundamental Plane. By comparing galaxies in different stages of the merging process we can constrain the amount of gas associated with these red mergers, the effect of active nuclei, and track structural changes. As two galaxies can be observed in a single orbit 20 orbits are requested to observe the 40 galaxies., In this paper, we examine how well galaxies and intracluster gas trace the gravitational potential of clusters. Utilizing mass profiles derived from gravitational lensing and X-ray observations, coupled with measured galaxy velocities, we solve for the velocity anisotropy parameter β<SUB>orb</SUB>(r) using the anisotropic Jeans equation. This is done for five clusters, three at low redshift: A2199, A496 and A576 and two at high redshifts: A2390 and MS1358. We use X-ray temperature profiles obtained from Chandra and ASCA/ROSAT data to estimate β<SUB>X</SUB>(r), the ratio of energy in the galaxies compared to the X-ray gas. We find that none of these clusters is strictly in hydrostatic equilibrium. We compare the properties of our sample with clusters that form in high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations that include baryonic physics. Simulations and data show considerable scatter in their β<SUB>orb</SUB>(r) and β<SUB>X</SUB>(r) profiles. We demonstrate the future feasibility and potential for directly comparing the orbital structure of clusters inferred from multiwavelength observations with high-resolution simulated clusters., Twelve EXOs (Extreme X-ray Objects) have been found in the ECDFS field, one of four fields that comprise the one-square-degree deep optical and infrared MUSYC survey (MUltiwavelength Survey by Yale-Chile). These EXOs are all X-ray bright but optically invisible at the R 27 mag (AB) limit of our optical imaging; all have bright counterparts in K-band (K&lt;22 mag, AB) and IRAC (3.6-8 microns) imaging. They are clearly redder than R-K&gt;5 (AB), and the space density is roughly consistent with that for EXOs found previously in the GOODS fields. The X-ray brightness means these are almost certainly AGN; the optical faintness means that not only must the AGN be obscured but the host galaxy light must be suppressed. Possible explanations include that the AGN are at very high redshift (z&gt;6), or sit in very dusty and/or sub-luminous host galaxies at more moderate redshifts (z 2-3). We interpret the spectral energy distributions based on the multiwavelength photometric data for all 12 EXOs, and report on recent GNIRS spectra of the three IR-brightest., Low extinction windows towards the Galactic bulge provide a good opportunity to use stellar proper motions to probe its kinematics and study the gravitational potential and mass distribution at this location. In particular, Plaut's window (A_V ∼ 0.8 mag) located at (l, b) = (0, -8), offers the opportunity to study the transition zone between the bulge and the Galactic disk. With this is mind, we performed an astrometric reduction on a set of 43 scanned photographic visual and blue plates, taken at this target with five different telescopes: the 20 arcsec Double Astrograph at the Yale Southern Observatory (Argentina), the 84 arcsec at KPNO (USA), the 100 arcsec du Pont at Las Campanas (Chile), the 4-m at CTIO (Chile), and the 200 arcsec Hale at Palomar (USA). These plates cover ∼ 30'×30' on the sky, with seeing from 1 arcsec to 3 arcsec and V_{lim} ∼ 22 so they reach below the bulge main-sequence turn off. These plates span over a 21-year baseline, adequate for a proper motion study, but the distortion introduced by each telescope and the crowded fields represent a challenge in the astrometric reduction. Centroids of the stars were initially computed by SExtractor and then refined with a Yale centering routine. A reduction scheme was adopted to maximize the ``free-of-distortion'' area on the plate, and to give more weight to the better quality plates. High order terms were required to model the distortion of the plates in most cases. Photometric calibration was done on ∼ 60,000 stars, based on 29 photoelectric standards in the field, and was used to include a color term in the astrometric reduction, when necessary. Typical photometric errors are ∼ 0.2 mag in each band. The magnitude equation was also corrected. The final catalogue covers 20'×20' and has 21660 stars, all of them with calibrated V and B-V, proper motions (μ_{l}, μ_{b}) and errors (eμ_{l}, eμ_{b}) in μas/yr (galactic coordinates). Proper motion errors are mostly around 1.0 mas and systematic errors are all below 0.2 mas/yr. With the purpose of selecting bulge red giant stars, we cross-referenced our catalogue with the 2MASS Catalogue and used the infrared photometry to cleanly identify these stars. From the color-magnitude diagram, K vs. J-K, we get a final sample of 537 stars. This sample shows the following dispersion in p.m.: (σμl, σμb) = (3.36, 2.80)+/- (0.11, 0.10) mas/yr. Assuming that the Sun-bulge distance is 8.541 kpc, then these values translate to a (ςl, ςb) = (135.37, 112.81) +/- (4.43, 4.03) km/s. Compared to previous studies, our results agree very well., The essential features of the stellar Initial Mass Function are, rather generally, (1) a peak at mass of a few tenths of a solar mass, and (2) a power-law tail toward higher masses that is similar to the original Salpeter function. Recent work suggests that the IMF peak reflects a preferred scale of fragmentation associated with the transition from a cooling phase of collapse at low densities to a nearly isothermal phase at higher densities, where the gas becomes thermally coupled to the dust. The Salpeter power law is plausibly produced, at least in part, by scale-free accretion processes that build up massive stars in dense environments. The young stars at the Galactic Center appear to have unusually high masses, possibly because of a high minimum mass resulting from the high opacity of the dense star-forming gas., The astrometric precision of Orthogonal Transfer CCDs (OTCCDs) is investigated, using the OPTIC camera at WIYN 3.5-m telescope. The precision of the positions, determined with the Yale image-centering code, was used to establish astrometric design requirements for the anticipated WIYN One Degree Imager camera that will use similar technology. <P />OTCCDs are able to electronically compensate for real-time image motion, providing tip/tilt corrections without additional optics or moving parts (Tonry et al. 1997, PASP, 109, 1154). The Orthogonal Parallel Transfer Imaging Camera (OPTIC) consists of two 2K by 4K OTCCDs arranged in a single dewar mounted adjacent to each other with a small gap between the chips. Each chip is electronically divided into two regions, and each of these is further subdivided into two parts: a guide region and a science region. When mounted on WIYN, the camera has a scale of 0.14 arcsec/pixel, and a 10 × 10 arcmin field of view. OPTIC has a read noise of &lt; 4 electrons when read at 160 kpix/sec and a nominal gain of 1.45 e^-/ADU. <P />To test the astrometric performance of OPTIC, we imaged the open cluster NGC 188, during 7 nights in october 2003, using Johnson-V and Gunn-i filters ranged from 0.6 arcsec to 3 arcsec, but only frames with &lt; 2 arsec were considered for this study. After a careful internal astrometric reduction, we estimate that OPTIC achieves a precision of 2 milliarseconds over the dynamical range of the CCDs. This precision is obviously affected by the stability of the atmosphere, so these results demonstrate that the unique charge tranfer donde by OPTIC, which tracks the motion of a guide star, is able to stabilize the field within the atmospheric isokinetic region to the level of a few milli-arcseconds., We report on high-resolution echelle spectroscopy of 20 giant stars in the Galactic old open cluster NGC 6791, obtained with Hydra at the WIYN telescope. High-precision radial velocity allows us to isolate 15 bona fide cluster members. From 10 of them we derive a global [M/H]=+0.39+/-0.05. We therefore confirm that NGC 6791 is extremely metal-rich, exhibits a few marginally subsolar abundance ratios, and within the resolution of our spectra does not show evidence of spread in metal abundance. With these new data we rederive the fundamental cluster parameters, suggesting that it is about 8 Gyr old and 4.3 kpc from the Sun. The combination of its chemical properties, age, position, and Galactic orbit hardly makes NGC 6791 a genuine Population I open cluster. We discuss possible interpretations of the cluster peculiarities, suggesting that the cluster might be what remains of a much larger system whose initial potential well could have been sufficient to produce high-metallicity stars and which has been depopulated by the tidal field of the Galaxy. Alternatively, its current properties may be explained by the perturbation of the Galactic bar on an object that originated well inside the solar ring, where the metal enrichment was very fast., The Extended Chandra Deep Field-South (ECDFS) survey consists of four Chandra X-Ray Observatory ACIS-I pointings and covers ~1100 arcmin<SUP>2</SUP> (~0.3 deg<SUP>2</SUP>) centered on the original CDF-S field to a depth of approximately 228 ks. This is the largest Chandra survey ever conducted at such depth, and only one XMM-Newton survey reaches a lower flux limit in the hard 2.0-8.0 keV band. We detect 651 unique sources: 587 using a conservative source-detection threshold and 64 using a lower source-detection threshold. These are presented as two separate catalogs. Of the 651 total sources, 561 are detected in the full 0.5-8.0 keV band, 529 in the soft 0.5-2.0 keV band, and 335 in the hard 2.0-8.0 keV band. For point sources near the aim point, the limiting fluxes are approximately 1.7×10<SUP>-16</SUP> and 3.9×10<SUP>-16</SUP>ergs cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> in the 0.5-2.0 and 2.0-8.0 keV bands, respectively. Using simulations, we determine the catalog completeness as a function of flux and assess uncertainties in the derived fluxes due to incomplete spectral information. We present the differential and cumulative flux distributions, which are in good agreement with the number counts from previous deep X-ray surveys and with the predictions from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) population synthesis model that can explain the X-ray background. In general, fainter sources have harder X-ray spectra, consistent with the hypothesis that these sources are mainly obscured AGNs., The ""Baja BC hypothesis"", which postulates that western Washington State, British Columbia and southern Alaska originated at the latitude of Mexico, has pitted paleomagnetic results against long-held interpretations about the tectonic evolution of western North America. In this paper we develop a new paleobotanical method for estimating paleolatitude and apply it to this problem. We start by showing that the modern MAT field for North America is well correlated with latitude, demonstrating the feasibility of using MAT to estimate paleolatitude. A compilation of MAT and floral data from 84 modern sites in Central and North America is used to establish a new prediction relationship, MAT = 1.32 + 28.99 P, where P is the proportion of smooth-margined species within a floral sample at a site. Our analysis also includes a more complete estimate of the uncertainties associated with estimating MAT from a measurement of P. Using modern data, we show that MAT and P can be used to estimate latitude as well. We then apply this approach to resolve the paleolatitude of Baja BC. Eleven floral sites from stable North America are used to establish the latitudinal MAT profile for North America during the Albian and Cenomanian. A floral site from the Winthrop Formation, a mid-Cretaceous (110-100 Ma) fluvial unit in the Methow basin of northern Washington State, is linked to the Baja BC block and predates its proposed northward offset. Forty-three morphospecies of dicotyledonous angiosperm leaves from the Winthrop Formation give P = 0.76, which is equivalent to a MAT of 23.4 °C, indicating a subtropical to tropical climate. We use the North American MAT profile to estimate a paleolatitude of 38.4°N for the Winthrop flora, indicating ∼ 2200 km of northward offset relative to stable North America., CCD BVI photometry is presented for seven previously unstudied star clusters projected towards the inner side of the Galaxy: Trumpler 23, Lynga 3, Collinder 307, Ruprecht 134, ESO552SC16, AL 5 and Kronberger 3. Colour-magnitude diagrams of the cluster regions allow us to conclude that Lynga 3 and ESO552SC16 are not clusters, but groups of bright stars probably located in the Carina-Sagittarius spiral arm. AL 5 and Kronberger 3 are so embedded in a dense stellar field that we cannot confirm their nature. Trumpler 23 and Ruprecht 134 are two intermediate-age open clusters located well inside the solar ring which deserve further attention. <P />Finally, Collinder 307 is an obscured younger cluster (250Myr) located in the Carina-Sagittarius spiral arm. Our results emphasize the difficulty to search for open clusters in the inner regions of the Galaxy due to the richness of the field and the patchy nature of the interstellar absorption, but at the same time significantly contribute to a better understanding of this complicated regions of the Milky Way., We selected 40 candidate Lyα-emitting galaxies (LAEs) at z~=3.1 with observed-frame equivalent widths greater than 150 Å and inferred emission-line fluxes above 2.5×10<SUP>-17</SUP> ergs cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> from deep narrowband and broadband MUSYC images of the Extended Chandra Deep Field South. Covering 992 arcmin<SUP>2</SUP>, this is the largest ``blank field'' surveyed for LAEs at z~3, allowing an improved estimate of the space density of this population of (3+/-1)×10<SUP>-4</SUP> h<SUP>3</SUP><SUB>70</SUB> Mpc<SUP>-3</SUP>. Spectroscopic follow-up of 23 candidates yielded 18 redshifts, all at z~=3.1. Over 80% of the LAEs are dimmer in continuum magnitude than the typical Lyman break galaxy (LBG) spectroscopic limit of R=25.5 (AB), with a median continuum magnitude R~=27 and very blue continuum colors, V-z~= 0. Over 80% of the LAEs have the right UVR colors to be selected as LBGs, but only 10% also have R&lt;=25.5. Stacking the UBVRIzJK fluxes reveals that LAEs have stellar masses ~=5×10<SUP>8</SUP> h<SUP>-2</SUP><SUB>70</SUB> M<SUB>solar</SUB> and minimal dust extinction, A<SUB>V</SUB>&lt;~0.1. Inferred star formation rates are ~=6 h<SUP>-2</SUP><SUB>70</SUB> M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, yielding a cosmic star formation rate density of 2×10<SUP>-3</SUP> h<SUB>70</SUB> M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-3</SUP>. None of our LAE candidates show evidence for rest-frame emission-line equivalent widths EW<SUB>rest</SUB>&gt;240 Å that might imply a nonstandard initial mass function. One candidate is detected by Chandra, implying an AGN fraction of 2%+/-2% for LAE candidate samples. In summary, LAEs at z~3 have rapid star formation, low stellar mass, little dust obscuration, and no evidence for a substantial AGN component. <P />Based on observations obtained with the Magellan telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory and at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, a division of the National Optical Astronomy Observatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation., A high-precision two-dimensional stellar evolution code has been developed for studying solar variability due to structural changes produced by varying internal magnetic fields of arbitrary configurations. Specifically, we are interested in modeling the effects of a dynamo-type field on the detailed internal structure and on the global parameters of the Sun. The high precision is required to model both very small solar changes (of the order of 10<SUP>-4</SUP>) and short timescales (of the order of 1 yr). It is accomplished by using the mass coordinate to replace the radial coordinate, by using fixed and adjustable time steps, a realistic stellar atmosphere, and element diffusion, and by adjusting the grid points. We have also built into the code the potential to subsequently include rotation and turbulence. The current code has been tested for several cases, including its ability to reproduce the one-dimensional results., N-flation is a promising embedding of inflation in string theory in which many string axions combine to drive inflation. We characterize the dynamics of a general N-flation model with nondegenerate axion masses. Although the precise mass of a single axion depends on compactification details in a complicated way, the distribution of masses can be computed with very limited knowledge of microscopics: the shape of the mass distribution is an emergent property. We use random matrix theory to show that a typical N-flation model has a spectrum of masses distributed according to the Marčenko Pastur law. This distribution depends on a single parameter, the number of axions divided by the dimension of the moduli space. We use this result to describe the inflationary dynamics and phenomenology of a general N-flation model. We produce an ensemble of models and use numerical integration to track the axions' evolution and the resulting scalar power spectrum. For realistic initial conditions, the power spectrum is considerably more red than in single-field m<SUP>2</SUP>phi<SUP>2</SUP> inflation. We conclude that random matrix models of N-flation are surprisingly tractable and have a rich phenomenology that differs in testable ways from that of single-field m<SUP>2</SUP>phi<SUP>2</SUP> inflation., On earth, phosphate has a strong biological oxygen isotope signature due to its concentration and intense cycling by living organisms as an essential nutrient. Phosphate does not undergo oxygen isotope exchange with water at low temperature without enzymatic catalysis, making the oxygen isotope ratio (18O/16O) of phosphate, δ18OP, an attractive biosignature in the search for early and extraterrestrial life. Recent laboratory and field studies have demonstrated that the δ18OP value of dissolved inorganic phosphate (PO4) records specific microbial activity and enzymatic reaction pathways in both laboratory cultures and natural waters/sediments (Blake et al., 2005; Colman et al 2005; Liang and Blake, 2005). Phosphate oxygen isotope biosignatures may be distinguished from abiotic signatures by: (1) evaluating the degree of temperature-dependent PO4-water oxygen isotope exchange in aqueous systems and deviation from equilibrium; and (2) evolution from an abiotic P reservoir signature towards a biotic P reservoir signature. Important abiotic processes potentially affecting phosphate δ18OP values include dissolution/precipitation, adsorption/desorption, recrystallization of PO4 mineral phases, diagenesis and metamorphism. For most of these processes, the recording, retention and alteration of δ18OP biosignatures have not been evaluated. Deep-sea hydrothermal vent fields are an ideal system in which to study the preservation and alteration of δ18OP biosignatures, as well as potential look-alikes produced by heat-promoted PO4 -water oxygen isotope exchange. Results from recent studies of δ18OP biosignatures in hydrothermal deposits near 9 and 21 degrees N. EPR and at Loihi seamount will be presented., Using effective field theory (EFT) methods we present a Lagrangian formalism which describes the dynamics of nonrelativistic extended objects coupled to gravity. The formalism is relevant to understanding the gravitational radiation power spectra emitted by binary star systems, an important class of candidate signals for gravitational wave observatories such as LIGO or VIRGO. The EFT allows for a clean separation of the three relevant scales: r<SUB>s</SUB>, the size of the compact objects, r, the orbital radius, and r/v, the wavelength of the physical radiation (where the velocity v is the expansion parameter). In the EFT, radiation is systematically included in the v expansion without the need to separate integrals into near zones and radiation zones. Using the EFT, we show that the renormalization of ultraviolet divergences which arise at v<SUP>6</SUP> in post-Newtonian (PN) calculations requires the presence of two nonminimal worldline gravitational couplings linear in the Ricci curvature. However, these operators can be removed by a redefinition of the metric tensor, so that the divergences arising at v<SUP>6</SUP> have no physically observable effect. Because in the EFT finite size features are encoded in the coefficients of nonminimal couplings, this implies a simple proof of the decoupling of internal structure for spinless objects to at least order v<SUP>6</SUP>. Neglecting absorptive effects, we find that the power counting rules of the EFT indicate that the next set of short distance operators, which are quadratic in the curvature and are associated with tidal deformations, does not play a role until order v<SUP>10</SUP>. These operators, which encapsulate finite size properties of the sources, have coefficients that can be fixed by a matching calculation. By including the most general set of such operators, the EFT allows one to work within a point-particle theory to arbitrary orders in v., We derive a long wavelength effective point-particle description of four-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes. In this effective theory, absorptive effects are incorporated by introducing degrees of freedom localized on the worldline that mimic the interaction between the horizon and bulk fields. The correlation functions of composite operators in this worldline theory can be obtained by standard matching calculations. For example, we obtain the low frequency two-point function of multipole worldline operators by relating them to the long wavelength graviton black hole absorptive cross section. The effective theory is then used to predict the leading effects of absorption in several astrophysically motivated examples, including the dynamics of nonrelativistic black hole binary inspirals and the motion of a small black hole in an arbitrary background geometry. Our results can be written compactly in terms of absorption cross sections, and can be easily applied to the dissipative dynamics of any compact object, e.g. neutron stars. The relation of our methodology to that developed in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence is discussed., The standard methods for quantizing relativistic strings diverge significantly from the Dirac-Wheeler-DeWitt program for quantization of generally covariant systems and one wonders whether the latter could be successfully implemented as an alternative to the former. As a first step in this direction, we consider the possibility of quantizing strings (and also relativistic membranes) via a partially gauge-fixed ADM (Arnowitt, Deser and Misner) formulation of the reduced field equations for these systems. By exploiting some (Euclidean signature) Hamilton-Jacobi techniques that Mike Ryan and I had developed previously for the quantization of Bianchi IX cosmological models, I show how to construct Diff( S <SUP>1</SUP>)-invariant (or Diff(Σ)-invariant in the case of membranes) ground state wave functionals for the cases of co-dimension one strings and membranes embedded in Minkowski spacetime. I also show that the reduced Hamiltonian density operators for these systems weakly commute when applied to physical (i.e. Diff( S <SUP>1</SUP>) or Diff(Σ)-invariant) states. While many open questions remain, these preliminary results seem to encourage further research along the same lines., We report the influence of shear deformation on the microstructure of water-saturated olivine and clinopyroxene aggregates. Prior to deformation, the aqueous fluid was isolated in pockets along grain corners in the olivine-water aggregates, while it was interconnected by a network of grain-edge tubules in the clinopyroxene-water aggregate. During deformation of both types of aggregates, the aqueous fluid phase segregates into grain boundaries at an angle of ~16° to the shear direction, inclined in a sense antithetic to the applied shear. Fluid-rich planes formed by such dynamic wetting of grain boundaries lead to the formation of high permeability paths in the matrix. In a deforming mantle, such high permeability paths will enhance the efficiency of aqueous fluid extraction from subducting slabs., This study investigates the extent of post-depositional alteration of δD values of n-alkyl lipids, isoprenoids, and kerogen isolated from a continuous 450 m core that covers the transition from thermally immature to early mature sediments in the lacustrine Kissenda Formation, Lower Cretaceous, Gabon Basin. Large variations in δD values (up to 40‰ for nC <SUB>17</SUB> and up to 30‰ for nC <SUB>29</SUB> alkanes as well as up to 10‰ for kerogen) in closely spaced samples are evident throughout the core and remain preserved even at the bottom of the section. δD values of individual n-alkanes show a slight overall D-enrichment with depth, and a general trend of increasing δD values with increasing n-alkane chain length characterizes all samples, particularly in those below 600 m depth. Hydrogen isotopic compositions of kerogen samples overlap with those of n-alkanes throughout the section. δD values of pristane and phytane are more negative than those of nC <SUB>17</SUB> alkane by as much as 120‰ at shallow depths but increase dramatically and approach δD values of nC <SUB>17</SUB> alkane in the samples closest to the oil window. Integration of analytical and computational results indicates that: (1) n-alkanes and isoprenoids have the potential to preserve the original biological signal before the onset of oil generation; (2) isomeric and structural rearrangements taking place at the beginning stages of oil generation do not influence significantly the δD values of n-alkanes and kerogen. However, these processes have a major effect on the isotopic composition of isoprenoids, causing isotopic D-enrichment up to 90‰., A Comment on the Letter by H. Esbensen, G. F. Bertsch, and K. A. Snover, Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 042502 (2005)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.94.042502. The authors of the Letter offer a Reply., In many models of inflation, the period of accelerated expansion ends with preheating, a highly non-thermal phase of evolution during which the inflaton pumps energy into a specific set of momentum modes of field(s) to which it is coupled. This necessarily induces large, transient density inhomogeneities which can source a significant spectrum of gravitational waves. In this paper, we consider the generic properties of gravitational waves produced during preheating, perform detailed calculations of the spectrum for several specific inflationary models, and identify problems that require further study. In particular, we argue that if these gravitational waves exist they will necessarily fall within the frequency range that is feasible for direct detection experiments—from laboratory through to solar system scales. We extract the gravitational wave spectrum from numerical simulations of preheating after λphi<SUP>4</SUP> and m<SUB>phi</SUB><SUP>2</SUP>phi<SUP>2</SUP> inflation, and find that they lead to a gravitational wave amplitude of around Ω<SUB>gw</SUB>h<SUP>2</SUP>~10<SUP>-10</SUP>. This is considerably higher than the amplitude of the primordial gravitational waves produced during inflation. However, the typical wavelength of these gravitational waves is considerably shorter than LIGO scales, although in extreme cases they may be visible at scales accessible to the proposed BBO mission. We survey possible experimental approaches to detecting any gravitational wave background generated during preheating., We present mid-infrared observations of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the GOODS fields, performed with the Spitzer Space Telescope. These are the deepest infrared and X-ray fields to date and cover a total area of ~0.1 deg<SUP>2</SUP>. AGNs are selected on the basis of their hard (2-8 keV) X-ray emission. The median AGN infrared luminosity is at least 10 times larger than the median for normal galaxies with the same redshift distribution, suggesting that the infrared emission is dominated by the central nucleus. The X-ray-to-infrared luminosity ratios of GOODS AGNs, most of which are at 0.5&lt;~z&lt;~1.5, are similar to the values obtained for AGNs in the local universe. The observed infrared flux distribution has an integral slope of ~1.5, and there are 1000 sources per square degree brighter than ~50 μJy at ~3-6 μm. The counts approximately match the predictions of models based on AGN unification, in which the majority of AGNs are obscured. This agreement confirms that the faintest X-ray sources, which are dominated by the host galaxy light in the optical, are obscured AGNs. Using these Spitzer data, the AGN contribution to the extragalactic infrared background light is calculated by correlating the X-ray and infrared catalogs. This is likely to be a lower limit given that the most obscured AGNs are missed in X-rays. We estimate the contribution of AGNs missed in X-rays, using a population synthesis model, to be ~45% of the observed AGN contribution, making the AGN contribution to the infrared background at most ~2%-10% in the 3-24 μm range, depending on wavelength, lower than most previous estimates. The AGN contribution to the infrared background remains roughly constant with source flux in the IRAC bands but decreases with decreasing flux in the MIPS 24 μm band, where the galaxy population becomes more important., We consider the long standing puzzle of how to obtain meaningful probabilities in eternal inflation. We demonstrate a new algorithm for computing the probability distribution of pocket universe types, given a multivacua inflationary potential. The computed probability distribution is finite and manifestly gauge independent. We argue that in some scenarios this technique can be applied to disfavour some eternally inflating potentials., Vigorous debate still surrounds the cloud electrification process and unexplained regional variations in lightning activity. Here, we show that climatological maxima in lightning activity are associated with small effective diameter D<SUB>e</SUB> of ice crystals near cumulonimbus cloud tops. This relationship, unlike lightning's more well-known relationship with cloud top height, is consistent over land and ocean. Since multiple studies indicate that D<SUB>e</SUB> is reduced by atmospheric aerosol, this relationship strengthens previous suggestions of a role for aerosols as well as dynamics in electrification. Moreover, the angular distribution of backscattered radiance shows that modest (~10%) D<SUB>e</SUB> decreases reflect large (~2×) increases in the number of small (&lt;~30 μm) particles N, a finding supported by cloud model simulations. Both relationships provide an important new test of cloud microphysics and/or electrification models., We consider the statistical properties of vacua and inflationary trajectories associated with a random multifield potential. Our underlying motivation is the string landscape, but our calculations apply to general potentials. Using random matrix theory, we analyse the Hessian matrices associated with the extrema of this potential. These potentials generically have a vast number of extrema. We show that if the cross-couplings (off-diagonal terms) are of the same order as the self-couplings (diagonal terms), essentially all extrema are saddles, and the number of minima is effectively zero. Avoiding this requires the same separation of scales as is needed to ensure that Newton's constant is stable against radiative corrections in a string landscape. Using the central limit theorem we find that even if the number of extrema is enormous, the typical distance between extrema is still substantial—with challenging implications for inflationary models that depend on the existence of a complicated path inside the landscape., We present measurements at optical wavelengths of the spectral reflectance, rotational light curve, and solar phase curve of 2003 EL61. With apparent visual magnitude 17.5 at 51 AU from the Sun, this newly discovered member of the classical Kuiper Belt is now the third brightest KBO after Pluto and 2005 FY9. Our observations reveal an unambiguous, double-peaked rotational light curve with period 3.9154+/-0.0002 hr and peak-to-peak amplitude 0.28+/-0.04 mag. This is the fastest rotation period reliably determined for any body in the solar system larger than 100 km. Assuming the body has relaxed over time to the shape taken by a homogenous fluid body, our observations tightly constrain the shape and density. Given the mass we recently determined for 2003 EL61 from the orbit of a small satellite, we also constrain the size and albedo. We find a total length of 1960-2500 km, a mean density of 2600-3340 kg m<SUP>-3</SUP>, and a visual albedo greater than 0.6. We also measure a neutral reflectance at visible wavelengths and a linear phase curve with slope varying from 0.09 mag deg<SUP>-1</SUP> in the B band to 0.13 mag deg<SUP>-1</SUP> in the I band. The absolute V-band magnitude is 0.444+/-0.021., Using extensive kinematical and morphological data on two Virgo Cluster galaxies undergoing strong nuclear star formation, we show that ram pressure stripping and gravitational interactions can act together on galaxies that have recently fallen into clusters. We present a detailed study of the peculiar H I-deficient Virgo Cluster spiral galaxies NGC 4064 and NGC 4424 using <SUP>12</SUP>CO 1-0 interferometry, optical imaging, and integral field spectroscopic observations in order to learn what type of environmental interactions have affected these galaxies. Optical imaging reveals that NGC 4424 has a strongly disturbed stellar disk, with banana-shaped isophotes and shells. NGC 4064, which lies in the cluster outskirts, possesses a relatively undisturbed outer stellar disk and a central bar. In both galaxies Hα emission is confined to the central kiloparsec and originates in barlike strings of luminous star-forming complexes surrounded by fainter filaments. Complexes of young blue stars exist beyond the present location of ongoing star formation, indicating rapidly shrinking star-forming disks. Disturbed dust lanes extend out to a radius of 2-3 kpc, much farther than the Hα and CO emission detected by us but similar to the blue stellar complexes. CO observations reveal bilobal molecular gas morphologies, with Hα emission peaking inside the CO lobes, implying a time sequence in the star formation process. Gas kinematics reveals strong barlike noncircular motions in the molecular gas in both galaxies, suggesting that the material is radially infalling. In NGC 4064 the stellar kinematics reveals strong barlike noncircular motions in the central 1 kpc and stars supported by rotation with V/σ&gt;1 beyond a radius of 15"" (1.2 kpc). On the other hand, NGC 4424 has extremely modest stellar rotation velocities (V<SUB>max</SUB>~30 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), and stars are supported by random motions as far out as we can measure, with V/σ=0.6 at r=18<SUP>''</SUP> (1.4 kpc). The ionized gas kinematics in the core are disturbed and possibly counterrotating. The observations suggest that the peculiarities of NGC 4424 are the result of an intermediate-mass merger plus ram pressure stripping. In the case of NGC 4064, the evidence suggests an already stripped ``truncated/normal'' galaxy that recently suffered a minor merger or tidal interaction with another galaxy. Observations of the present star formation rate and gas content suggest that these galaxies will become small-bulge S0s within the next 3 Gyr. We propose that galaxies with ``truncated/compact'' Hα morphologies such as these are the result of the independent effects of ram pressure stripping, which removes gas from the outer disk, and gravitational interactions such as mergers, which heat stellar disks, drive gas to the central kiloparsec, and increase the central mass concentrations. Together these effects transform the morphology of these galaxies., We present an initial look at the far-infrared-radio correlation within the star-forming disks of four nearby, nearly face-on galaxies (NGC 2403, NGC 3031, NGC 5194, and NGC 6946). Using Spitzer MIPS imaging, observed as part of the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS), and Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) radio continuum data, taken for the WSRT SINGS radio continuum survey, we are able to probe variations in the logarithmic 24 μm/22 cm (q<SUB>24</SUB>) and 70 μm/22 cm (q<SUB>70</SUB>) surface brightness ratios across each disk at subkiloparsec scales. We find general trends of decreasing q<SUB>24</SUB> and q<SUB>70</SUB> with declining surface brightness and with increasing radius. The residual dispersion around the trend of q<SUB>24</SUB> and q<SUB>70</SUB> versus surface brightness is smaller than the residual dispersion around the trend of q<SUB>24</SUB> and q<SUB>70</SUB> versus radius, on average by ~0.1 dex, indicating that the distribution of star formation sites is more important in determining the infrared/radio disk appearance than the exponential profiles of disks. We have also performed preliminary phenomenological modeling of cosmic-ray electron (CR electron) diffusion using an image-smearing technique and find that smoothing the infrared maps improves their correlation with the radio maps. We find that exponential smoothing kernels work marginally better than Gaussian kernels, independent of projection for these nearly face-on galaxies. This result suggests that additional processes besides simple random walk diffusion in three dimensions must affect the evolution of CR electrons. The best-fit smoothing kernels for the two less active star-forming galaxies (NGC 2403 and NGC 3031) have much larger scale lengths than those of the more active star-forming galaxies (NGC 5194 and NGC 6946). This difference may be due to the relative deficit of recent CR electron injection into the interstellar medium for the galaxies that have largely quiescent disks., One of the most intriguing challenges in high-energy astrophysics has been understanding the dynamics of accretion flow onto compact objects. X-ray binaries exhibit many different patterns of accretion flow, manifested as ""X- ray states"". Various states show dramatically different spectral energy distributions and temporal behavior. In particular, two canonical states are seen in most X-ray binaries---a ""soft"" state characterized by strong thermal emission and low variability in the light curve, and a ""hard"" state characterized by nonthermal power law emission and high variability. Besides these canonical states, a variety of intermediate and extreme states are also seen often. A complete understanding of these X-ray states is essential not only to understand the physical mechanisms associated with the different types of accretion flows, but also in enabling one to test physics in the regime of strong-field general relativity. <P />While it is generally known that the mass accretion rate onto the compact object influences a transition from one state to another, recent observations have shown that there are additional factors that determine the state of a source. In this dissertation, I have used X-ray spectral and temporal information from neutron star and black hole systems to explore the factors that might be contributing towards a state transition. The X-ray data were obtained using the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) satellite, triggered by our optical/near-IR monitoring of X-ray binaries using the CTIO 1.3m telescope operated by SMARTS consortium. <P />I have also used data from our long-term (~ 8 years) optical/near-IR monitoring of the neutron star system Aql X-1 to show that the outer accretion disk heats up like a simple blackbody during the course of evolution of an outburst. Optical data, along with soft-X-ray data from the All Sky Monitor aboard RXTE, demonstrated that besides the canonical ""fast-rise and exponential-decay"" (FRED) lightcurve morphology seen during outbursts, Aql X-1 frequently went through ""low intensity state"" outbursts characterized by a prolonged, somewhat variable light curve and significantly lower X-ray-to-optical flux ratio compared to the FREDs. From the optical/near-IR observations, the use colormagnitude diagram as a tool for detecting non-thermal radiation from X-ray binaries is also shown., Using the deep multiwavelength MUSYC, GOODS, and FIRES surveys we construct a stellar mass-limited sample of galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3. The sample comprises 294 galaxies with M&gt;10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> distributed over four independent fields with a total area of almost 400 arcmin<SUP>2</SUP>. The mean number density of massive galaxies in this redshift range ρ(M&gt;10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>)=(2.2+/-0.6)×10<SUP>-4</SUP> h<SUP>3</SUP><SUB>70</SUB> Mpc<SUP>-3</SUP>. We present median values and 25th and 75th percentiles for the distributions of observed R<SUB>AB</SUB> magnitudes, observed J-K<SUB>s</SUB> colors, and rest-frame ultraviolet continuum slopes, M/L<SUB>V</SUB> ratios, and U-V colors. The galaxies show a large range in all these properties. The ``median galaxy'' is faint in the observer's optical (R<SUB>AB</SUB>=25.9), red in the observed near-IR (J-K<SUB>s</SUB>=2.48), has a rest-frame UV spectrum that is relatively flat in F<SUB>λ</SUB> (β=-0.4), and rest-frame optical colors resembling those of nearby spiral galaxies (U-V=0.62). We determine which galaxies would be selected as Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) or distant red galaxies (DRGs, having J-K<SUB>s</SUB>&gt;2.3) in this mass-limited sample. By number DRGs make up 69% of the sample, and LBGs 20%, with a small amount of overlap. By mass DRGs make up 77%, and LBGs 17%. Neither technique provides a representative sample of massive galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3 as they only sample the extremes of the population. As we show here, multiwavelength surveys with high-quality photometry are essential for an unbiased census of massive galaxies in the early universe. The main uncertainty in this analysis is our reliance on photometric redshifts; confirmation of the results presented here requires extensive near-infrared spectroscopy of optically faint samples., Recent studies have shown that galaxies at 2&lt; z&lt; 3 can be selected efficiently in the rest-frame optical. As most of these K- selected galaxies are very faint in the rest-frame ultra-violet they complement samples selected by the well known Lyman break technique. Studies of these red z&gt; 2 galaxies have been hampered by the lack of deep multi-wavelength data over sufficiently large fields. We are remedying this situation in the joint Yale/Chile MUSYC near-IR project, which consists of a deep public ISPI survey of three Southern fields. Observations for two fields have been completed, while the third and final 10'×10' MUSYC field, CW1255, was partially observed in 2005A. Here we propose to complete the JHK imaging of CW1255 down to the depth of the other two fields. The CW1255 field already has fully reduced deep UBVRIz images, and shallow JHK data. Together the three MUSYC fields will provide high quality public optical and near-IR imaging over an area of eq400 arcmin^2, a factor of 6 larger than the existing VLT imaging in Chandra Deep Field South. Our aims are to 1) measure the surface density and field- to-field variation of K_s&lt; 21.5 near-IR selected galaxies at 2&lt; z$&lt; 3; 2) determine their clustering amplitude and thereby constrain their halo mass; 3) determine their luminosity function as function of their properties, such as colors and stellar mass., Be stars are a class of rapidly rotating B-type stars with circumstellar disks that cause Balmer and other line emission. There are three possibile causes for their rapid rotation: they may have been born as rapid rotators, spun up by binary mass transfer, or spun up during the main-sequence evolution of B stars. From a photometric search for Be stars in 55 open clusters and followup spectra of 11 clusters, we found that ~75% of our Be stars show evidence of having been spun up by binary mass transfer, while the other scenarios do not produce significant numbers of Be stars. However, this result does not include 86 Be star candidates in the remaining clusters whose emission status must be confirmed spectroscopically. In addition, over three years of observations of 11 clusters, we have identified 8 Be stars that have undergone disk outbursts and 7 whose disks have disappeared. The rate of variability does not seem to be constant, and we will investigate stellar and cluster properties that may affect their long term variability. New spectra of 20 open clusters will provide confirmation of most of our remaining Be star candidates as well as a 4- year time baseline to study disk appearances and disappearances in these clusters., We propose near-infrared K_s-band imaging of a unique sample of 26 X-ray selected galaxy clusters at moderate to high redshift (z=0.35- 0.90) with approved Chandra observations. We will measure their stellar masses and study their galaxy populations over the entire virial regions and into the infall regions. Both semi-analytic models and simulations incorporating radiative cooling and galaxy formation overpredict the stellar masses of clusters by a factor of 2-3. Our photometry will measure the stellar masses and hence the star formation efficiency and its dependence on both redshift and cluster mass. These data will also establish cluster scaling relations and their evolution at z=0.35-0.90, robustly quantify the ``down-sizing'' effect and its dependence on mass, study the evolution of cluster galaxies from the infall regions to their cores, measure the halo occupation function and its evolution, and provide important inputs into future cluster surveys which will probe dark energy. A large, complete sample is required to test systematics in cluster scaling relations with both mass and redshift. These data will also be used to understand the history of star formation in clusters with proposed Spitzer observations and provide efficient target selection for future spectroscopy., We present the results of detailed analysis of pointed X-ray observations by RXTE of the black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) system V4641 Sgr (SAX J1819.3-2525) during its outburst of 2003 August. Soft X-ray (3-20 keV) flux variations by factors of 10 or more on timescales of minutes or shorter were seen. The rapid and strong variability of this source sets it apart from typical XRBs. In spite of large luminosity fluctuations, the spectral state of the source did not change significantly during the dwells, which suggests that the physical emission processes did not change much during the observations. The energy spectra during the dwells were dominated by a hard Comptonized power-law component, indicative of the canonical low/hard state observed in other BHXRBs. No soft thermal component was found in three out of the four RXTE pointings. However, spectral deconvolution of the observation with the largest average luminosity suggests an obscured, hot accretion disk. During one of the observations, we detected a short-term (~100 s) soft X-ray dropout, which is apparently due to variability in the observed column density. A strong Fe Kα fluorescent emission line near 6.5 keV was detected with large equivalent widths in the range 700-1000 eV. In the temporal domain, the Fourier power spectra were dominated by red noise below a few hertz. Poisson noise dominated at higher frequencies, and no high-frequency features were detected. The strong Comptonized spectra, broad iron emission line, absence of a disk component in the spectra, absence of any timing variability above a few hertz, and occasional large changes in the column density along the line of sight all support an enshrouded black hole with occasional outflow and a very dynamic environment., We discuss the evidence gathered from helioseismology about considerable mixing below the solar convection zone. The evidence is obtained directly through inversions and also through more subtle, somewhat indirect signatures if mixing., This study utilizes optical imaging, optical spectroscopy, HI radio maps and UV imaging to study the effects of environment on the evolution of spiral galaxies in the nearby Virgo Cluster. <P />Optical, HI and radio continuum observations of NGC 4402, a highly inclined HI- deficient Virgo 0.5 L * spiral galaxy, show evidence for ram pressure stripping and dense cloud ablation. Optical images show dust curving up and out of the stellar disk at the HI truncation radius. South of the main dust disk, we have discovered two linear dust filaments aligned with each other and with the skewed radio continuum halo. We interpret these dust filaments as large, dense clouds which were initially left behind as the low-density ISM was stripped, but are now being ablated by the ICM wind. <P />We present results from 10 spiral galaxies in Virgo that have truncated star- forming disks, with normal star formation in the inner disk and little or no star formation beyond a truncation radius. Models of observed spectra from just beyond the Ha truncation radius demonstrate that stripping was recent, within the last 500 Myr. This implies that ram pressure stripping is effective in halting star formation in the outer disks of spiral galaxies and plays a role in the morphological transformation of spiral galaxies. <P />The outer disk of one of our sample, NGC 4522, shows a post-star formation K+A type spectrum, consistent with star formation being truncated ~ 100 Myr ago. &gt;From its location in the cluster, we conclude that such stripping could not have taken place in the cluster core and must have taken place near its current location, ~ 1 Mpc from the cluster center. <P />The outer disk stellar populations roughly correlate with the neutral gas distributions, as measured from HI maps. Galaxies with extraplanar HI have more recently had star formation in their outer disks truncated. In the three cases where our data overlap with ram pressure simulations of Virgo galaxies, the star formation truncation times from our data agree with the time since peak pressure in the simulations. This suggests that star formation is quickly disrupted during ISM-ICM interactions., The astrometric precision of Orthogonal Transfer CCDs (OTCCDs) is investigated by using OPTIC camera at the WIYN 3.5-m telescope. The precision of the positions, determined by the Yale image-centering code, will be used to establish astrometric design requirements for the anticipated WIYN One Degree Imager Camera that will use similar technology., We have begun an investigation at Plaut's low extinction window, located at (l,b)=(0,-8), i.e., at the interface between the bulge and the halo. We use 43 scanned photographic plates which cover around 25 arcmin× 25 arcmin. These plates were taken through five different telescopes over 21 years of time in order to get a deep and large catalog of relative proper motions of the Galactic bulge. Particular attention was paid to the correction of optical field-angle distortion and to differential atmospheric color refraction. The analysis is further complicated by the relatively poor image quality and high degree of crowding on these plates. The photometric data have been partially reduced and will be used in combination with 2MASS infrared data to photometrically segregate the bulge stars from the disk ones. Thus, relatively clean samples will be provided for the study of the bulge's kinematical properties. From the 60,000 stars measured, a subset of ∼ 3,000 stars with high precision proper motions and V &gt; 18 mag was selected as probable bulge members. This subsample yields a proper motion dispersion of 3.12 mas/yr and 2.82 mas/yr in galactic longitude and latitude, respectively., Astrometry is poised to enter an era of unparalleled growth and relevance due to the wealth of highly accurate data expected from the SIM and GAIA space missions. Innovative ground-based telescopes are planned, such as the LSST, which will provide less precise data, but for many more stars. The potential for studies of the structure, kinematics and dynamics of our Galaxy as well as for the physical nature of stars and the cosmological distance scale is without equal in the history of astronomy. It is therefore ironic that worldwide it is possible to obtain an extensive education in astrometry only in St. Petersburg and Paris and in two years not one course in astrometry will be taught in the US. Who will ensure the astrometric quality control for the JWT, SIM, GAIA, LSST, to say nothing about the current large ground-based facilities, such as the VLT, Gemini, Keck, NOAO, Magellan, LBT, etc.? <P />We propose a renewal of astrometric education in the universities to prepare qualified scientists so that the scientific returns from the investment of billions of dollars in these unique facilities will be maximized. The funding agencies are providing outstanding facilities. The universities, national and international observatories and agencies should acknowledge their responsibility to hire qualified full-time astrometric scientists to teach students and to supervise existing and planned astronomical facilities so that quality data will be obtained and analyzed. <P />A temporary solution to this problem is proposed in the form of a series of international summer schools in Astrometry. The Michelson Science Center of the SIM project will hold an astrometry summer school in 2005 to begin this process. A one-semester syllabus is suggested as a means of meeting the needs of Astronomy by educating students in astrometric techniques that might be most valuable for careers associated with modern astrophysics., In the beta-decay of the ground state of 26 Al (denoted 26g Al, t 1/2 = 7.2 × 10 5 y), a characteristic 1.809 MeV gamma-ray is emitted. This signature of the presence of 26g Al has been widely observed throughout the Galaxy. Indeed, the observation of this gamma-ray proves the ongoing nucleosynthesis of 26g Al in astrophysical environments, given its short half-life on cosmological timescales. Reproduction of the Galactic 26g Al steady-state abundance implied by the observations (~3 [Special characters omitted.] ) provides a powerful constraint on nucleosynthesis model calculations. These calculations may also be used to determine the relative contributions to the 26g Al abundance by different types of astrophysical phenomena. <P />The amount of 26g Al produced in nova explosions on oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarfs is thought to be relatively minor (~0.1-0.4 [Special characters omitted.] ). Nuclear uncertainties in the 25 Al(p,[gamma]) 26 Si and 26g Al(p, [gamma]) 27 Si reactions may change this by a factor of ~2, however. A direct study of the 25 Al (p,[gamma]) 26 Si reaction has been proposed and accepted at the TRIUMF-ISAC radioactive beams facility in Vancouver, Canada, and is awaiting the production of a sufficiently-intense 25 Al beam. To both guide this direct study, and to improve the accuracy of the current 25 Al(p,[gamma]) 26 Si calculations (based on indirect measurements), we have made a new measurement of the 26 Si mass. We find the mass excess of 26 Si to be [Delta] ( 26 Si)= -7139.5 ±1 1.0 keV; this new mass leads to a reduction in the = 25 Al(p, [gamma]) 26 Si rate by as much as ~30% at nova temperatures. We have also made new measurements of the energy and strength of a key resonance for the 26g Al (p,[gamma]) 27 Si reaction: we find E R CM = 184 ± 1 keV and [omega][gamma] = 35 ± 4 stat ± 55 sys [mu]eV. These results lead to a decrease in the 26g Al(p, [gamma]) 27 Si rate by as much as ~15% at nova temperatures. <P />Our measurements of the 26 Si mass and the resonance in 26 Al(p,[gamma]) 27 Si both imply an increase in the 26g Al yield from novae, but still confirm the secondary nature of their contribution to the Galactic abundance of 26g Al., The space telescope MOST is now providing us with extremely accurate low-frequency p-mode oscillation data for the star η Boo. We demonstrate in this paper that these data, when combined with ground-based measurements of the high-frequency p-mode spectrum, can be reproduced with stellar models that include the effects of turbulence in their outer layers. Without turbulence, the l=0 modes of our models deviate from either the ground-based or the space data by about 1.5-4 μHz. This discrepancy can be completely removed by including turbulence in the models, and we can exactly match 12 out of 13 MOST frequencies that we identified as l=0 modes, in addition to 13 out of 21 ground-based frequencies within their observational 2 σ tolerances. The better agreement between model frequencies and observed frequencies depends for the most part on the turbulent kinetic energy that was taken from a three-dimensional convection simulation for the Sun., The first charge-coupled device UBV(RI)<SUB>C</SUB> photometric study in the area of the doubtful open cluster NGC 2129 is presented. Photometry of a field offset 15 arcmin northwards is also provided, to probe the Galactic disc population towards the cluster. Using star counts, proper motions from the UCAC2 catalogue, colour-magnitude and colour-colour diagrams, we demonstrate that NGC 2129 is a young open cluster. The cluster radius is 2.5 arcmin, and across this region we find evidence of significant differential reddening, although the reddening law seems to be normal towards its direction. Updated estimates of the cluster fundamental parameters are provided. The mean reddening is found to be E(B-V) = 0.80 +/- 0.08 and the distance modulus is (m-M)<SUB>0</SUB>= 11.70 +/- 0.30. Hence, NGC 2129 is located at 2.2 +/- 0.2 kpc from the Sun inside the Local spiral arm. The age derived from 37 photometrically selected members is estimated to be approximately 10 Myr. These stars are used to provide new estimates of the cluster absolute proper-motion components., Standard stellar models for η Boo fail to reproduce the newly observed low frequency p-modes from space and the high frequency p-modes observed from the ground, simultaneously. This discrepancy can be removed by including turbulence in the modeling of the outer layers of η Boo. We include turbulence by applying the effects of turbulent pressure and turbulent kinetic energy -- extracted from a hydrodynamical 3D convection simulation for the Sun -- at the correct depth in the 1D models of η Boo., We study the color-magnitude diagram morphologies of M3 and M13 using high precision Hubble Space Telescope photometry. Asymmetric broadening above and to the red of the main sequence is apparent. We use extensive artificial star experiments to synthetically reproduce chance superposition and photometric error, and examine if a main-sequence binary population is required to account for the observed asymmetric broadening. We find that the most probable binary fraction f b in the center of M3 lies between 6% and 22%. For those stars with distances from the cluster center of M3 between one and two core radii, the most probable value of f b lies between 1% and 3%. The similar radial distributions of binaries and blue stragglers support the model that the BSs in the center of M3 are of collisional origin. A similar comparison between the color distributions of real stars and artificial stars in the CMD of M13 suggests that the real star distributions are consistently broader than the artificial ones. After corrections of real and artificial differences in color uncertainties, we find evidence for an intrinsic color dispersion among MS stars of about 0.013 to 0.014 magnitude in both the center and outer regions of M13. This is larger than the expected value resulting from the spectroscopically observed [Fe/H] dispersion, and might reflect differences in [C/Fe] and [N/Fe] that have been noted spectroscopically among upper MS stars in M13. <P />With the observations of globular cluster o Cen through the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on Hubble Space Telescope, the radial distributions of blue stragglers (BSs) and blue subdwarfs (sdBs) in the cluster are studied. No significant differences between radial distributions of BSs and the corresponding reference populations are found, which implies that no signature of mass segregation is evident in o Cen and the cluster is dynamically unrelaxed. Collisional origin should not be responsible for the majority of the BSs observed in o Cen. Radial distributions of bright and faint sdBs are studied, the hints for different models of sdBs origin are discussed., In this essay, we introduce a theoretical framework designed to describe black hole dynamics. The difficulties in understanding such dynamics stems from the proliferation of scales involved when one attempts to simultaneously describe all of the relevant dynamical degrees of freedom. These range from the modes that describe the black hole horizon, which are responsible for dissipative effects, to the long wavelength gravitational radiation that drains mechanical energy from macroscopic black hole bound states. We approach the problem from a Wilsonian point of view, by building a tower of theories of gravity each of which is valid at different scales. The methodology leads to multiple new results in diverse topics including phase transitions of Kaluza-Klein black holes and the interactions of spinning black hole in non-relativistic orbits. Moreover, our methods tie together speculative ideas regarding dualities for black hole horizons to real physical measurements in gravitational wave detectors., Grain-growth kinetics in wadsleyite was investigated using a multianvil high-pressure apparatus. Fine-grained wadsleyite aggregates were synthesized by isostatic hot-pressing and were subsequently annealed under high pressure and temperature in a controlled chemical environment. Wadsleyite samples show normal grain-growth characterized by a log-normal grain-size distribution following the relation, L-L0n=kt where n is a constant, L the grain-size at time t, L<SUB>0</SUB> the grain-size at time t = 0 and k is a rate constant that depends on temperature T and chemical environments ( f: oxygen fugacity in Pa, C<SUB>OH</SUB>: water content in H/10 <SUP>6</SUP>Si) as: k=ADfOr exp{-HD*}/{RT}+AWfOrCOHq exp{-HW*}/{RT} with AD=10 (m s Pa), r<SUB>D</SUB> = 0.12 ± 0.11(0.20 ± 0.14), HD* = 410 ± 230(500 ± 270) kJ/mol, AW=10 (m s Pa), r<SUB>W</SUB> = 0.14 ± 0.05(0.22 ± 0.06), q = 1.7 ± 0.3(2.2 ± 0.3) and HW* = 120 ± 60(160 ± 70) kJ/mol with assumed value of n = 2(3) (values in parentheses denote parameters for n = 3). Both water and oxygen fugacities significantly enhance grain-growth kinetics. The large value of the parameter describing the water fugacity dependence, q ∼ 1.5-2.5, cannot be explained solely by a simple model in which grain-growth is controlled by diffusion of atoms (defects) across the grain-boundaries The interaction of grain-boundaries with charged defects or the density of hydrated ledges may be important factors that control the grain-growth kinetics of wadsleyite. When compared at similar thermo-chemical conditions, grain-growth of wadsleyite is found to be more sluggish than grain-growth of olivine. The present results show that a small wadsleyite grain-size (&lt;1 mm) in subducting slabs can be maintained for a significant geological time (∼1 My) under ""dry"" (&lt;200 H/10 <SUP>6</SUP>Si) conditions when the temperature is lower than 1500 K, whereas when a large amount of water (&gt;100,000 H/10 <SUP>6</SUP>Si) is present, a small grain-size (&lt;1 mm) can only be maintained for a significant time at low temperatures (&lt;600 K)., We present UBVRIz' optical images taken with MOSAIC on the CTIO 4 m telescope of the 0.32 deg<SUP>2</SUP> Extended Hubble Deep Field-South. This is one of four fields comprising the MUSYC survey, which is optimized for the study of galaxies at z=3, active galactic nucleus (AGN) demographics, and Galactic structure. Our methods used for astrometric calibration, weighted image combination, and photometric calibration in AB magnitudes are described. We calculate corrected aperture photometry and its uncertainties and find through tests that these provide a significant improvement upon standard techniques. Our photometric catalog of 62,968 objects is complete to a total magnitude of R<SUB>AB</SUB>=25, with R-band counts consistent with results from the literature. We select z~=3 Lyman break galaxy (LBG) candidates from their UVR colors and find a sky surface density of 1.4 arcmin<SUP>-2</SUP> and an angular correlation function w(θ)=(2.3+/-1.0)θ<SUP>-0.8</SUP>, consistent with previous findings that high-redshift Lyman break galaxies reside in massive dark matter halos. Our images and catalogs are available online. <P />Based on observations obtained at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, a division of the National Optical Astronomy Observatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation., Black hole mass (M<SUB></SUB>) is a fundamental property of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We collect and estimate M<SUB></SUB> for a large sample of ∼ 500 AGNs to investigate the relation of AGN activity to M<SUB></SUB>. For a subsample of 39 AGNs at z&lt;0.6, we measure and collect stellar velocity dispersion to investigate the evolution of host galaxies. We compare M<SUB></SUB> estimates generated by different methods and find, for individual objects, a scatter as high as a couple of orders of magnitude. The less direct the method, the larger the discrepancy with other estimates, probably due to the large scatter in the underlying correlations assumed. In contrast to other studies, we find no significant correlation of M<SUB></SUB> with AGN luminosity, other than those induced by circular reasoning in the estimation of M<SUB></SUB>. M<SUB></SUB> of radio-loud and radio-quiet AGNs span the same large range, 10<SUP>6}-10<SUP>{10</SUP></SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, suggesting radio loudness in AGNs does not depend strongly on M<SUB></SUB>. The M<SUB></SUB> range for different BL Lac object spectral types is also similar, 10<SUP>7</SUP> ≲ M<SUB>}/M<SUB>{⊙</SUB></SUB> ≲ 4 × 10<SUP>9</SUP>. Neither X-ray or radio luminosity correlates with M<SUB></SUB>. Low-frequency-peaked BL Lac objects have higher Eddington ratios on average, because of either more beaming or larger intrinsic power. BL Lac object host galaxies and radio galaxies lie on the same fundamental plane as normal galaxies. Comparing the mass-to-light ratio evolution with our population synthesis models, we find that single burst star formation models with z<SUB>form</SUB> = 1.4<SUP>+0.9</SUP> <SUB>-0.2</SUB> are consistent with the observations. The estimated R band mass-to-light ratio evolution, Δ log (M/L)/ Δ z = -0.502, is consistent with that of normal early-type galaxies. The normality of AGN host galaxies supports the hypothesis that AGNs are a transient phase in the evolution of galaxies., Clusters play an important role in the evolution of their member galaxies. In the nearby Virgo cluster, we can observe galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-cluster interactions at a level of detail not easily accessible at higher redshift. We present results of an observational study of spiral galaxies in the Virgo Cluster, utilizing optical and UV imaging, HI observations, and optical spectroscopy. These galaxies, many of which have normal stellar distributions and truncated gas disks, are likely the result of ram-pressure stripping by hot cluster gas. Our results indicate that there is a correlation between HI morphology and the age-sensitive Balmer absorption line strength. Specifically, those galaxies with asymmetric HI distributions or extraplanar HI, indicating a recent disturbance by the intra-cluster medium, have the youngest stellar populations in the gas-free outer disk. Observations of both gas and stellar populations allow us to understand when and where galaxies are transformed by gas stripping effects in clusters. <P />One of the most striking galaxies in our sample is NGC 4522. This galaxy, with a large fraction of its neutral gas displaced to one side of the stellar disk, is one of the best examples of ongoing ram pressure stripping in Virgo. Optical spectroscopy of the outer disk of NGC 4522 (i.e. beyond the sites of active star formation), shows strong Hβ absorption, indicative of a young stellar population and consistent with a recent truncation of star formation in the outer disk. Additionally, we observe strong Hγ and Hδ absorption, similar to post-starburst k+a galaxies at higher redshift. This suggests that some k+a galaxies observed at higher redshift may be recently stripped cluster spirals., Water vapor, OH, and H2CO have been detected around the carbon-rich star IRC +10216. It has been suggested that the presence of these chemicals is evidence for the existence of a cometary system around that star. Observations have also indicated that the distribution of OH around the star is not symmetric. We previously proposed that the asymmetry in the OH can be caused by an asymmetric distribution of the comets around IRC +10216. Previous work also proposed that the asymmetric distribution of the comets around IRC +10216 might be due to the gravitational influence of a Jupiter-sized planet. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the presence of a planet can plausibly account for such a distribution of extrasolar comets. We have considered a planetary system consisting of a star and a Jupiter-sized planet, and studied the orbital stability of a large grid of comets around the planet's Lagrangian points. We have run numerical simulations of orbital stability for different masses of the central star, and also for different values of the mass and semimajor axis of the planet. The simulations indicate that stable cometary orbits can exist, and it is possible that a collection of comets be held in stable resonant orbits with the planet., The Multiwavelength Survey by Yale-Chile (MUSYC) consists of deep UBVRIzJHK+NB5000 coverage of 1.2 square degrees comprised of four fields. Satellite coverage includes Spitzer, HST-ACS, GALEX, XMM and Chandra. Multi-object spectroscopy has been obtained with Magellan+IMACS, VLT+VIMOS, and Gemini+GNIRS. MUSYC has used these data to investigate Lyman break galaxies, Lyman alpha emitters, Distant red galaxies, Damped Lyman alpha absorption systems, and AGN in the same volume of the universe in order to separate physical properties from selection effects. We will present correlation functions and dark matter halo masses for each population along with the total cosmic star formation rate and stellar mass densities at z=3. A public data release of images and catalogs is available at www.astro.yale.edu/MUSYC. <P />We gratefully acknowledge support from Fundacion Andes, FONDAP Center of Astrophysics, Sigma Xi, PSC-CUNY and the Yale Perspectives in Science program.

However, the exact number of these objects remains unknown, even though they could nearly double the space density of supermassive black holes. These Compton-thick AGN can be detected in the hard X-rays with INTEGRAL. As part of the current observing cycle, we were awarded 2 Msec to perform INTEGRAL imaging of the XMM-LSS field in order to find highly obscured AGN in the local Universe. In this paper, we present preliminary results for the ∼1 Ms of IBIS data obtained so far, including new hard X-ray detections of AGN. We also present the 20---200 keV spectra of the brightest AGN including the z&lt;0.1 Seyfert galaxies NGC 788, NGC 1068, and NGC 1142., The MUltiwavelength Survey by Yale-Chile (MUSYC) covers one square degree of the sky with deep near-infrared and optical imaging, as well as some Chandra, XMM, Hubble, and Spitzer coverage. As part of this project, we have analyzed the X-ray properties of objects in the extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDFS), including Lyman Break Galaxies (LBG) and Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAE). A fraction are detected individually due to the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGN), but most are too X-ray faint to detect as individual sources, even in very deep exposures. Subsequently, we performed X-ray stacking analysis on these remaining, optically selected, 76 LAE and 1240 LBG in order to determine their average X-ray properties. This analysis provided an effective integrated exposure time of 17 Ms for the LAE and 233 Ms for the LBG. We present the average X-ray flux of these sources and discuss their implications for star formation., The MUltiwavelength Survey by Yale-Chile (MUSYC) includes as one of its four 1/4-degree fields the Extended Chandra Deep Field-South (ECDFS), for which a recent public X-ray survey covered ∼1100 square arcminutes with 4 Chandra ACIS-I pointings centered on the original CDF-S field, to a depth of approximately 228 ks. This is the largest Chandra survey ever conducted at such depth. We detect 651 unique X-ray sources, of which 561 are detected in the full 0.5--8.0 keV band, 529 in the soft 0.5--2.0 keV band, and 335 in the hard 2.0--8.0 keV band. Seventy-three percent of the X-ray sources have optical counterparts in deep MUSYC imaging of this field while 26% have no apparent counterpart down to R=27.1 (AB). The remaining 1% have multiple optical counterparts within 1.5"" of their X-ray position. We present the magnitude distributions and colors, as well as optical spectra of selected sources, and compare them to the X-ray properties. We discuss the nature of the underlying AGN populations, and implications for obscuration in AGN., Plate tectonics is the unifying theory of geology, yet much remains to be understood about its development on Earth and absence on other planets. The generation of plate tectonics from mantle convection requires shear localization in order to form narrow, weak zones that separate the broad, strong plate interiors. Two-phase damage theory provides a theoretical framework to describe the failure and weakening that leads to shear localization. Two-phase damage theory allows for the development of damage to be manifested in two distinct ways: void generation associated with dilation of the matrix and increasing the fineness of the mixture (e.g. pulverization). This work will examine the application of two-phase damage theory to the problem of generating plate-like behavior from mantle convection. Our model will consist of a thin plate obeying a two-phase damage rheology overlaying a Newtonian mantle that is undergoing simple thermal convection in two dimensions. Our objective is to determine how successful the different manifestations of damage are at producing plate-like behavior in a more sophisticated simulation than previously examined. Time-dependent calculations were performed in a systematic investigation of parameter space to determine the regimes in which two-phase damage theory was able to generate plate-like behavior. Our results suggest that damage manifested as increasing the fineness of the mixture generates better plate tectonic behavior than damage manifested as dilation of the matrix., The arrival of next-generation, ground-based detectors such as HESS, soon to be joined by VERITAS, has ushered in a new era in TeV gamma-ray astronomy. I will review the physics issues that can be addressed by the new detectors and discuss the theoretical implications of some of the latest observations., The extent of the central convective region is one of the crucial factors that govern the structure and evolution of massive stars. It has been suggested that observations of seismic waves that penetrate the deepest layers of a star might be used to estimate the size of such convective cores. This would allow a rigorous test of the current theories of convection and stellar evolution. We investigate whether suitable diagnostics can be constructed from the frequencies of low degree modes of oscillation which are sensitive to the size and evolution of the stellar core. <P />SB and BC are partially supported in this research by grant ATM-0348837 from NSF. PD is supported by NASA grant NAG5-13299., In recent years, relativistic jets extending hundreds of kpc from the quasar nucleus have been detected with Hubble and Chandra. However, the emission mechanism(s), particularly in the X-ray, responsible for the kpc-scale jets remains unsettled. To open yet another window to observe jet emissions, we have performed infrared imaging of four quasar jets with the Spitzer Space Telescope IRAC during the first observing cycle. In this paper, we present initial results for the quasars 3C 273 and PKS 0637-752, from both of which jet emissions in the mid-infrared regime (up to the 5.8 micron band) have been clearly detected. Our infrared observations bring new clues as to the origin of the broadband emission, and put a meaningful constraint on jet composition on large scales, which demonstrating the importance of exploring the infrared portion of jet emission., Standard stellar models for η Boo fail to reproduce the observed low frequency p-modes from space and the high frequency p-modes observed from ground, simultaneously. This discrepancy can be mitigated by including turbulence in the modeling of the outer layers of η Boo. We present new results of our full 3D turbulent convection simulation of η Boo's outer layers. With these simulations we are able to answer the question whether the discrepancy between models and observations can be fully attributed to the effects of turbulence. <P />This research was supported by NASA grant NAG5-13299, and in part by the NASA EOS/IDS program., Accreting compact binary systems are excellent laboratories for studying dynamics and stability of gas flows in accretion disks and jets and also allows testing relativity in strong-field limit. Soft X-ray transients (SXTs) are an interesting sub-class of compact binary systems. Their luminosity is generally very low, however occasionally they brighten up by several orders of magnitude at all wavelengths. The increase in flux is directly associated with an increase in the inferred mass accretion rate (˙ M). A host of different states, characterized by markedly different spectral and temporal features, are seen during an outburst of an SXT as it goes through the wide range of luminosities during the outburst. <P />While it is believed that change in ˙ M is a principal factor in triggering state transitions in SXTs, we present compelling evidence from two systems, one neutron star (Aql X-1) and another black hole (V4641 Sgr), for the existence of factors other than ˙ M that can trigger state transition. We have seen that during major outbursts of Aql X-1, transition from powerlaw photon dominated state to thermal dominated state during the rise of an outburst always occurs at a higher luminosity (and hence ˙ M) than the transition back to powerlaw state during outburst decay, a clear evidence for the existence of factor(s) other than ˙ M in operation. In contrast, during a low-intensity outburst of Aql X-1, we have seen that the usual correlation between optical and X-ray flux is not obeyed and the maximum optical flux is seen during the powerlaw dominated state. In V4641 Sgr, we find flux variation by factor of 5 or more within timescales of minutes, without any change in the state of the source. For V4641 Sgr we also find evidences for an enshrouded black hole with occasional outflows and very dynamic environment., With its deep near-infrared imaging, the MUltiwavelength Survey by Yale-Chile (MUSYC) is ideal for finding EXOs, i.e., objects with Extreme X-ray to Optical flux ratios. Defining an EXO as an X-ray source with no optical counterpart down to R ∼27 but a reasonably bright K-band counterpart (K&lt;22 AB), EXOs are very red with R-K &gt;5. We describe 7 EXOs found in the Extended Chandra Deep Field-South (ECDFS), a wide-deep public survey with area ∼1100 square arcminutes ( ∼0.3 deg<SUP>2</SUP>) and depth ∼228 ks. Our X-ray catalog reaches X-ray fluxes of ∼1.7 x 10<SUP>-16</SUP> erg cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> and ∼3.9 x 10<SUP>-16</SUP> erg cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> in the 0.5--2.0 keV and 2.0--8.0 keV bands, respectively, and our optical and near-IR imaging reaches R=27 (AB) and K=23 (AB, central area; K=22 over full area). The 7 EXOs discovered in the ECDFS may be dusty galaxies at z ∼2-3, or quasars at z&gt;6, or unusually faint galaxies at low redshift. We describe fits to the multi-band SEDs and compare to EXOs found in other deep X-ray surveys., The success of the Pan-STARRS NEO discovery program, will critically depend upon the automatic tracking of millions of observations, with the full sky covered on a monthly basis. Manual analysis and tracking of millions of NEO observations is not only rate limiting, but also highly error prone. Methods for fully automatic tracking of NEOs, which is similar to the missile-tracking problem, are being actively investigated. A new adjusted Kalman filter-based linear prediction and error model, is proposed for fast Mahalanobis-distance based gating using the KD-tree data structure, multiple hypothesis track pruning, and track assignment using a tree data structure. Our results using the novel (T,I) celestial coordinate system shows over 99% accuracy in correct pair-wise track associations for the same night observations, and remarkably over the longer four-night epochs, performance does not degrade as it does using other standard celestial coordinate systems including (α ,δ ), (λ ,β ), or (x,y,z). The (T,I) coordinates have a more linear behavior and so the Kalman predictions are more accurate. However, the Kalman prediction errors are biased and skewed. A new adjusted Kalman filter model is introduced to recursively incorporate the actual prediction error statistics using the test data. The multiple hypothesis tree containing all feasible tracks at the final epoch of tracking has over a 90% success rate in finding the correct asteroid associations within the top 30 tracks as ranked in terms of the average along track Mahalanobis distance. Future work includes incorporating joint assignment to prune the tree, and the use of a non-linear elliptical orbit prediction model combined with Monte Carlo covariance estimation methods to eliminate false tracks from the final set of long associations. Both of these extensions should further improve performance towards achieving automatic multi-target tracking of millions of asteroids., The AGN unification paradigm has been able to explain the observed properties of both obscured and unobscured AGN in the local Universe. However, whether this remains true at higher redshift is still unknown. Using a modified version of the AGN unification scheme, one in which the ratio of obscured-to-unobscured AGN changes with luminosity (more obscured AGN at lower luminosities) but does not evolve with redshift, we were able to explain the multiwavelength properties, ranging from infrared to X-rays, of the X-ray sources detected in the GOODS fields, which overlap with the deepest Chandra and XMM observations. This calculation assumes an average obscured-to-unobscured AGN ratio of 3:1, consistent with the observations of AGN in the local Universe. Allowing for an additional contribution from Compton-thick sources, we were able to explain the spectral shape and intensity of the X-ray background in the 1-100 keV range, where AGN emission is expected to dominate. The AGN contribution to the infrared background constrained from Spitzer observations of the GOODS fields is ∼ 2× lower than previously expected, about 3-6% in the 3-24 microns range. The possible dependence of the obscured to unobscured ratio with redshift is examined, and we outline a test of this dependence with a highly complete sample of AGN with measured redshifts using a combination of spectroscopic and reliable photometric redshifts. <P />We gratefully acknowledge support from Fundacion Andes, FONDAP Center of Astrophysics and Sigma Xi. This work was supported by NASA grants HST-GO-09425(.01-A,.13-A,.26-A) and HST-GO-09822.09-A., The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) will be one of a suite of new, large telescopes for the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century probing fundamental physics, the origin and evolution of the Universe, the structure of the Milky Way Galaxy, and the formation and distribution of planets. <P />The epoch of reionization (EoR) sets a fundamental benchmark in cosmic structure formation, corresponding to the formation of the first luminous objects that ionize the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM). Recent observations at near-IR and radio wavelengths imply that we are finally probing into this key epoch of galaxy formation at z &gt; 6. The SKA will provide critical insight into the EoR in a number of ways (for a review, see Carilli et al. 2004, NewAR, 48, 1029). First, the ability of the SKA to image the neutral IGM in 21cm emission is a truly unique probe of the process of reionization and is recognized as the next necessary and fundamental step in our study of the evolution of large scale structure and cosmic reionization. Second, study of HI 21cm absorption toward the first radio loud objects probes small to intermediate scale structure in the neutral 'cosmic web', as well as HI in the first collapsed structures (proto-disks and mini-halos). And third, the incomparable sensitivity of the SKA allows for the study of the molecular gas, dust, and star formation activity in the first galaxies, as well as the radio continuum emission from the first accreting massive black holes. Such objects will be obscured at optical wavelengths due to absorption by the neutral IGM. <P />The National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) is operated by Associated Universities, Inc. under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation., We present a study of tidal debris associated with 126 nearby red galaxies, selected from the 1.2 deg<SUP>2</SUP> Multiwavelength Survey by Yale-Chile and the 9.3 deg<SUP>2</SUP> NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey. In the full sample, 67 galaxies (53%) show morphological signatures of tidal interactions consisting of broad fans of stars, tails, and other asymmetries at very faint surface brightness levels. When restricting the sample to the 86 bulge-dominated early-type galaxies, the fraction of tidally disturbed galaxies rises to 71%, which implies that for every ``normal'' undisturbed elliptical there are two that show clear signs of interactions. The tidal features are red and smooth and often extend over &gt;50 kpc. Of the tidally distorted galaxies, about two-thirds are remnants, and one-third are interacting with a companion galaxy. The companions are usually bright red galaxies as well; the median R-band luminosity ratio of the tidal pairs is 0.31, and the median color difference after correcting for the slope of the color-magnitude relation is -0.02 in B-R. If the ongoing mergers are representative for the progenitors of the remnants, ~35% of bulge-dominated galaxies experienced a merger with mass ratio &gt;1:4 in the recent past. With further assumptions it is estimated that the present-day mass accretion rate of galaxies on the red sequence ΔM/M=0.09+/-0.04 Gyr<SUP>-1</SUP>. For a constant or increasing mass accretion rate with redshift, we find that red mergers may lead to an evolution of a factor of &gt;~2 in the stellar mass density in luminous red galaxies over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;1, consistent with recent studies of the evolution of the luminosity density. We conclude that the majority of today's most luminous field elliptical galaxies were assembled at low redshift through mergers of gas-poor, bulge-dominated systems. These ``dry'' mergers are consistent with the high central densities of ellipticals, their old stellar populations, and the strong correlations of their properties. It will be interesting to determine whether this mode of merging only plays an important role at low redshift or is relevant for galaxies at any redshift if they exceed a critical mass scale., Using improved calculations for the possible spectra of obscured AGN and their host galaxies, we critically examine current models for the X-ray background. Given the latest Chandra and XMM X-ray survey results, we then explore the major uncertainties left in our understanding of this background, in particular in the fraction of highly obscured AGN and in the contributions from alternate source populations such as X-ray emitting blazars. We discuss how an imaging hard X-ray mission such EXIST mission will remove these ambiguities., Seismic studies of the Sun have helped us determine solar structure and dynamics to a degree of precision that is often met with disbelief. This amazing precision has allowed us to use the Sun as a laboratory to study not only different aspects of stellar evolution theory but also to study questions that involve fundamental physics such as the solar neutrino problem. In this talk I shall discuss how we are able to determine solar structure to such amazing precision and how such results let us test different inputs to stellar evolution calculations. In particular, I shall discuss the recent controversy over solar abundances. I shall also touch upon how we could study more about the physics of stars when we have stellar oscillation frequencies, Wind accretion models of the X-ray luminosity in massive X-ray binaries (MXRBs) predict a class of ""quiet"" MXRBs in which the stellar wind is too weak to power a strong X-ray source. The first two candidates systems, HD 14633 and HD 15137, were recently detected. These O star + neutron star systems were ejected from the open cluster NGC 654, but although they both show evidence of a past supernova within the binary system, neither is a known X-ray emitter. These systems provide a new opportunity to examine the ejection mechanisms responsible for the OB runaway stars, and they can also provide key information about the evolution of spun-up, rejuvenated massive stars. We present here preliminary results from a search for other such quiet MXRBs. <P />MVM is supported by an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship under award AST-0401460., We present new Raman spectra data of carbonaceous material (CM) to extend the range of the Raman spectra of CM thermometer (RSCM) to temperatures as low as 100 °C. Previous work has demonstrated that Raman spectroscopy is an excellent tool to describe the degree of graphitization of CM, a process that is independent of pressure but strongly dependent on metamorphic temperature. A linear relationship between temperature and the Raman parameter R2 (derived from the area of the defect band relative to the ordered graphite band) forms the basis of a previous thermometer. Because R2 shows little variability in low-temperature samples, 330 °C serves as a lower limit on the existing thermometer. Herein, we present Raman spectra from a suite of low-temperature (100 to 300 °C) samples from the Olympics Mountains and describe other aspects of the Raman spectra of CM that vary over this range. In particular, the Raman parameter R1 (the ratio of heights of the disordered peak to ordered peak) varies regularly between 100 and 350 °C. These data, together with published results from higher-temperature rocks, are used to calibrate a modified RSCM thermometer, applicable from 100 to 700 °C. Application to low-grade metasediments in the Otago region in the South Island of New Zealand gives temperatures consistent with previous estimates, demonstrating the reliability of the modified RSCM thermometer. We apply the modified RSCM thermometer to 53 samples from Crete to evaluate the role of the Cretan detachment fault in exhuming Miocene high pressure/low-temperature metamorphic rocks exposed there. The metamorphic rocks below the detachment (the Plattenkalk and Phyllite-Quartzite units) give metamorphic temperatures that range from 250 to 400 °C, consistent with previous petrologic estimates. We also demonstrate that the Tripolitza unit, which lies directly above the detachment, gives an average metamorphic temperature of about 260 °C. The modest break in metamorphic temperature in central Crete indicates that the Cretan detachment accounts for only 5 to 7 km of exhumation of the underlying HP-LT metamorphic rocks, which were initially accreted at ∼ 35 km. We argue that the bulk of the exhumation (∼ 28 km out of 35 km total) occurred by pervasive brittle stretching and erosion of structural units above the detachment., Black hole mass, along with mass accretion rate, is a fundamental property of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We collect and estimate black hole mass for a large sample of ~500 AGNs, and investigate the relation of AGN activity to black hole mass. For a subsample of 39 AGNs at z &lt; 0.6, we measure and collect stellar velocity dispersion, estimate black hole mass, and invesigate the evolution of host galaxies. <P />We compare black hole mass estimates generated by different methods and find, for individual objects, a scatter as high as a couple of orders of magnitude. The less direct the method, the larger the discrepancy with other estimates, probably due to the large scatter in the underlying correlations assumed. <P />In contrast to other studies, we find no significant correlation of black hole mass with AGN luminosity, other than those induced by circular reasoning in the estimation of black hole mass. For any given black hole mass, there is a range in Eddington ratio of up to 3 orders of magnitude, with the Eddington limit as an approximate upper envelope to the distribution of luminosities. The black hole mass of radio-loud and radio-quiet AGNs span the same large range, 10 6 - 10 10 M [Special characters omitted.] , suggesting radio loudness in AGNs does not depend on black hole mass. <P />The black hole mass range for different BL Lac spectral types, defined by X-ray to radio flux ratio, is similar, 10 7 [Special characters omitted.] M BH / M [Special characters omitted.] 4 x 10 9 . Neither X-ray or radio luminosity correlates with black hole mass. Low-frequency-peaked BL Lac objects have higher Eddington ratios on average, because of either more beaming or larger intrinsic power. For the black hole mass range 3 x 10 7 [Special characters omitted.] M * [Special characters omitted.] 10 9 , the radio luminosity of BL Lac objects and flat-spectrum radio quasars spans over 4 orders of magnitude, with BL Lac objects being low-power AGNs. <P />BL Lac object host galaxies and radio galaxies seem to lie on the same fundamental plane as normal galaxies. Comparing the mass-to-light ratio evolution in the observed-frame with our population synthesis models, we find that single burst star formation models with z form = [Special characters omitted.] are consistent with the observations. After K -correction using our z form = 1.4 model, we estimate the intrinsic mass-to-light ratio evolution in the Cousins R band, D log ( M / L )/D z = -0.502, consistent with that of normal early-type galaxies. The normality of AGN host galaxies supports the hypothesis that AGNs are a transient phase in the evolution of most or all galaxies., CCD BVI photometry is presented for eight previously unstudied star clusters located in the first and fourth Galactic quadrants: AL 1, BH 150, NGC 5764, Lynga 9, Czernik 37, BH 261, Berkeley 80 and King 25. Colour-magnitude diagrams of the cluster regions suggest that several of them (BH 150, Lynga 9, Czernik 37, BH 261 and King 25) are so embedded in the dense stellar population toward the galactic centre that their properties, or even their existence as physical systems, cannot be confirmed. Lynga 9, BH 261 and King 25 appear to be slight enhancements of dense star fields, BH 150 is probably just a single bright star in a dense field and Czernik 37 may be a sparse, but real cluster superimposed on the galactic bulge population. We derive preliminary estimates of the physical parameters for the remaining clusters. AL 1 appears to be an intermediate-age cluster beyond the solar circle on the far side of the galaxy and the final two clusters, NGC 5764 and Berkeley 80, are also of intermediate age but located inside the solar ring. This set of clusters highlights the difficulties inherent in studying the stellar populations toward the inner regions of the galaxy., We examine the dynamics of inflation driven by multiple, interacting scalar fields and derive a multifield version of the Hubble slow roll expansion. We show that the properties of this expansion naturally generalize those of the single field case. We present an analogous hierarchy of slow roll parameters, and derive the system of flow equations that describes their evolution, and show that when this system is truncated at finite order, it can always be solved exactly. Lastly, we express the scalar and tensor perturbation spectra in terms of the slow roll parameters., The transport of groundwater colloids (e.g., bacteria, viruses, clay particles) is governed, in part, by the rate at which the colloids strike and adhere to aquifer mineral grains. We report results of coupled flow and transport simulations that reveal how changes in mineral-grain shape and surface roughness influence the single-collector contact efficiency (η<SUB>T</SUB>) - a parameter of colloid-filtration theory that quantifies the frequency of colloid collisions with the surface of a mineral grain (collector). Our analyses indicate that the sensitivity of η<SUB>T</SUB> to variations in collector shape and roughness depends on colloid size and suggests that quantitative descriptions of colloid transport through real aquifers will, in some cases, require nontraditional approaches that are not limited by the simplifying assumptions of smooth, spherical collectors., In this Letter, we calculate the redshift distribution of gamma-ray bursts assuming that they trace (i) the globally averaged star formation rate or (ii) the average metallicity in the Universe. While at redshifts 5 and below both the star formation rate and the metallicity are observationally determined modulo some uncertainties, at higher redshifts there are few constraints. We extrapolate the star formation rate and metallicity to higher redshifts and explore models that are broadly consistent with bounds on the optical depth from WMAP results. In addition, we also include parametric descriptions of the luminosity function, and the typical spectrum for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). With these essential ingredients included in the modelling, we find that a substantial fraction (75 per cent) of GRBs are expected to originate at redshifts below 4, in variance with some previous estimates. Conversely, if we assume as expected for the collapsar model that gamma-ray bursts favour a low-metallicity environment, and therefore relate the GRB rate to a simple model of the average metallicity as a function of redshift, we find that a higher fraction of bursts, about 40 per cent, originate from z &gt; 4. We conclude with the implications of Swift GRB detections., The Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM) is expected to have a field-of-view that is several orders of magnitude larger than that of current instruments on the Hubble Space Telescope, with only slightly reduced sensitivity and resolution. This contribution gives a brief discussion of the impact that JDEM would have on studies of galaxies in clusters at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2 and of the most massive galaxies at higher redshift. Of particular importance is JDEMs unique wide-field near-IR capability, enabling the selection and morphological study of high redshift galaxies in the rest-frame optical rather than the rest-frame ultra-violet., CCD BVI photometry of the faint open clusters Berkeley 73, Berkeley 75 and Berkeley 25 are presented. The two latter are previously unstudied clusters to our knowledge. While Berkeley 73 is found to be of intermediate-age (about 1.5 Gyr old), Berkeley 75 and Berkeley 25 are old clusters, with ages greater than 3.0 Gyr. We provide also estimates of the clusters size. All these clusters lie far away from the Galactic Center, at R_GC ≥ 16 kpc, and quite high on the Galactic plane, at |Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>| ≥ 1.5 kpc. They are therefore important targets to probe the properties of the structure of the Galaxy in this direction, where the Canis Major over-density has been discovered to be located., Be stars are a class of rapidly rotating B stars with circumstellar disks that cause Balmer and other line emission. There are three possible reasons for the rapid rotation of Be stars: they may have been born as rapid rotators, spun up by binary mass transfer, or spun up during the main-sequence (MS) evolution of B stars. To test the various formation scenarios, we have conducted a photometric survey of 55 open clusters in the southern sky. Of these, five clusters are probably not physically associated groups and our results for two other clusters are not reliable, but we identify 52 definite Be stars and an additional 129 Be candidates in the remaining clusters. We use our results to examine the age and evolutionary dependence of the Be phenomenon. We find an overall increase in the fraction of Be stars with age until 100 Myr, and Be stars are most common among the brightest, most massive B-type stars above the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS). We show that a spin-up phase at the terminal-age main sequence (TAMS) cannot produce the observed distribution of Be stars, but up to 73% of the Be stars detected may have been spun-up by binary mass transfer. Most of the remaining Be stars were likely rapid rotators at birth. Previous studies have suggested that low metallicity and high cluster density may also favor Be star formation. Our results indicate a possible increase in the fraction of Be stars with increasing cluster distance from the Galactic center (in environments of decreasing metallicity). However, the trend is not significant and could be ruled out due to the intrinsic scatter in our data. We also find no relationship between the fraction of Be stars and cluster density., We present spectroscopic line-strength data for 4097 red-sequence galaxies in 93 low-redshift galaxy clusters and use these to investigate variations in average stellar populations as a function of galaxy mass. Our analysis includes an improved treatment of nebular emission contamination, which affects ~10% of the sample galaxies. Using the stellar population models of D. Thomas and collaborators, we simultaneously fit 12 observed line-strength-σ relations in terms of common underlying trends of age, [Z/H] (total metallicity), and [α/Fe] (α-element enhancement). We find that the observed line-strength-σ relations can be explained only if higher mass red-sequence galaxies are, on average, older, more metal-rich, and more α-enhanced than lower mass galaxies. Quantitatively, the scaling relations are age~σ<SUP>0.59+/-0.13</SUP>, Z/H~σ<SUP>0.53+/-0.08</SUP>, and α/Fe~σ<SUP>0.31+/-0.06</SUP>, where the errors reflect the range obtained using different subsets of indices. Our conclusions are not strongly dependent on which Balmer lines are used as age indicators. The derived age-σ relation is such that if the largest (σ~400 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) galaxies formed their stars ~13 Gyr ago, then the mean age of low-mass (σ~50 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) objects is only ~4 Gyr. The data also suggest a large spread in age at the low-mass end of the red sequence, with 68% of the galaxies having ages between 2 and 8 Gyr. We conclude that although the stars in giant red galaxies in clusters formed early, most of the galaxies at the faint end joined the red sequence only at recent epochs. This ``downsizing'' trend is in good qualitative agreement with observations of the red sequence at higher redshifts but is not predicted by semianalytic models of galaxy formation., We show in this Letter that the changes of the solar diameter in response to variations of large-scale magnetic fields and turbulence are not homologous. For the best current model, the variation at the photospheric level is over 1000 times larger than the variation at a depth of 5 Mm, which is about the level at which f-mode solar oscillations determine diameter variations. This model is supported by observations that indicate larger diameter changes for high-degree f-modes than for low-degree f-modes, since the energy of the former is concentrated at shallower layers than the latter., The black hole candidate V4641 Sgr (=SAX J1819.3-2525) went through a brief outburst during 2003 Aug 01 to Aug 08. During the outburst, activity was noted in optical, radio as well as X-rays. We report results of our X-ray spectral analysis and simultaneous X-ray and optical observations of the source during this outburst. Characteristics of the observed X-ray spectral energy distribution is discussed. The spectral results suggest occasional outflow/mass ejection and an obscured accretion disk. Simultaneous X-ray and optical R band lightcurves show strong correlation and the optical lags the X-rays, which can be explained if the origin of the optical emission is attributed to reprocessing of X-rays at the outer regions of the accretion disk., Emission from the relativistic jet located hundreds of kiloparsecs from the core of the superluminal quasar PKS 0637-752 was detected at 3.6 and 5.8 μm with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope. The unprecedented sensitivity and arcsecond resolution of IRAC allows us to explore the mid-infrared emission from kiloparsec-scale quasar jets for the first time. The mid-infrared flux from the jet knots, when combined with radio and optical fluxes, confirms the synchrotron origin of the radio-to-optical emission and constrains very well the high-energy end of the nonthermal electron distribution. Assuming that the X-rays are produced in the relativistically moving knots via inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, the infrared observation puts constraints on the matter content of the large-scale quasar jet. Specifically, pure e<SUP>+</SUP>e<SUP>-</SUP> pair jet models are unfavorable based on the lack of an infrared bump associated with the ``bulk Comptonization'' of CMB photons by an ultrarelativistic jet., We investigate the environmental dependence of star formation in cluster virial regions and infall regions as part of the Cluster and Infall Region Nearby Survey (CAIRNS), a large spectroscopic survey of the infall regions surrounding nine nearby rich clusters of galaxies. We use complete, homogeneous spectroscopic surveys of K<SUB>s</SUB>-limited samples in eight of the CAIRNS clusters. Our long-slit spectroscopy yields estimates of star formation rates in environments from cluster cores to the general large-scale structure. Galaxies in infall regions probe whether processes affecting star formation are effective over scales larger than cluster virial regions. The fraction of galaxies with current star formation in their inner disks as traced by Hα emission increases with distance from the cluster and converges to the ``field'' value only at 2-3 virial radii, in agreement with other investigations. However, among galaxies with significant current star formation (EW[Hα]&gt;=2 Å), there is no difference in the distribution of EW[Hα] inside and outside the virial radius. This surprising result, first seen by Carter and coworkers, suggests that (1) star formation is truncated either on very short timescales or only at moderate and high redshifts or (2) that projection effects contaminate the measurement. We quantify the possible impact of mechanisms that only affect the outer parts of galaxies and thus might not be detected in this survey or any fiber-based survey. The number density profiles of star-forming and non-star-forming galaxies indicate that, among galaxies projected inside the virial radius, at least half the former and 20% of the latter are ``infall interlopers,'' galaxies in the infall region but outside the virial region. We show that the kinematics of star-forming galaxies in the infall region closely match those of absorption-dominated galaxies. This result shows that the star-forming galaxies in the infall regions are not interlopers from the field and excludes one model of the backsplash scenario of galaxy transformation. Finally, we quantify systematic uncertainties in estimating the global star formation in galaxies from their inner disks., We study the fluxes of neutrinos from annihilations of dark matter particles in the Sun and the Earth. We give the spectra of all neutrino flavors for the main known annihilation channels: νν¯, bb¯, ττ¯, cc¯, light quarks, ZZ, W<SUP></SUP>W<SUP></SUP>. We present the appropriate formalism for computing the combined effect of oscillations, absorptions, ν<SUB></SUB>-regeneration. Total rates are modified by an O(0.1 10) factor, comparable to astrophysical uncertainties, that instead negligibly affect the spectra. We then calculate different signal topologies in neutrino telescopes: through-going muons, contained muons, showers, and study their capabilities to discriminate a dark matter signal from backgrounds. We finally discuss how measuring the neutrino spectra can allow to reconstruct the fundamental properties of the dark matter: its mass and its annihilation branching ratios., We report stellar velocity dispersion measurements for a sample of 28 active galactic nucleus (AGN) host galaxies, including our previous work. Using the mass-dispersion (M<SUB>•</SUB>-σ) and the fundamental plane relations, we estimate the black hole mass for a sample of 66 BL Lac objects and investigate the role of black hole mass in the energetics of BL Lac objects. The black hole mass range for different BL Lac spectral types is similar, 10<SUP>7</SUP>&lt;M<SUB>•</SUB>&lt;4×10<SUP>9</SUP>. Neither X-ray nor radio luminosity correlates with black hole mass. Low-frequency-peaked BL Lac objects have higher Eddington ratios on average, because of either more beaming or higher intrinsic power. For the black hole mass range 3×10<SUP>7</SUP>&lt;M<SUB>•</SUB>&lt;10<SUP>9</SUP>, the radio luminosity of BL Lac objects and flat-spectrum radio quasars spans over 4 orders of magnitude, with BL Lac objects being low-power AGNs. We also investigate the evolution of host galaxies for 39 AGNs out to z~0.5 with measured stellar velocity dispersions. Comparing the mass-to-light ratio evolution in the observed frame with population synthesis models, we find that single-burst star formation models with z<SUB>form</SUB>=1.4<SUP>+0.9</SUP><SUB>-0.2</SUB> are consistent with the observations. From our z<SUB>form</SUB>=1.4 model, we estimated the intrinsic mass-to-light ratio evolution in the Cousins R band, Δlog(M/L)/Δz=-0.502+/-0.08, consistent with that of normal early-type galaxies., Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) unification, which implies a large number of obscured AGNs, can explain the optical, infrared, and X-ray content of deep multiwavelength surveys. Here we show that the same model also successfully explains the spectral shape and intensity of the X-ray background. The simplest possible unified model assumes a constant ratio of obscured to unobscured AGNs, independent of redshift or luminosity. With almost no free parameters, the predicted X-ray background agrees remarkably well with observations. Both the observed properties of deep AGN samples and the X-ray background can be explained by the same model without invoking a different evolution for obscured and unobscured AGNs. Recent observational evidence shows that the ratio of obscured to unobscured AGNs may depend on luminosity. An AGN unification model that allows for such a dependence also fits the X-ray background spectrum, and the predicted number counts in the 2-10 keV X-ray band are in good agreement with observations. We present predictions for the source counts in hard X-rays (10-100 keV), which indicate that future missions such as the Black Hole Finder probe will observe thousands of heavily obscured AGNs., We have determined the total numbers and specific frequencies of blue, metal-poor globular clusters (GCs) in eight spiral and early-type galaxies. These data, along with five measurements from the literature, show a trend of increasing blue GC specific frequency with increasing mass of the host galaxy. The increase is not accounted for in a simple galaxy formation model in which elliptical galaxies and their GC systems are formed by the merger of typical spiral galaxies. The data appear broadly consistent with hierarchical formation scenarios in which metal-poor GCs are formed over a finite period in the early universe during the initial stages of galaxy assembly. In this picture, the observed trend is related to biasing, in the sense that the more massive galaxies of today began assembling earlier and therefore formed relatively more GCs during this early epoch of metal-poor GC formation. We discuss how comparisons of the observed specific frequency of metal-poor GCs with model calculations can constrain the formation redshift of these objects., We have measured the absolute proper motion of the candidate Canis Major dwarf galaxy (CMa), at (l,b)=(240°,-8°). Likely main-sequence stars in CMa have been selected from a region in the color-magnitude diagram that has very little contamination from known Milky Way components. We obtain μ<SUB>l</SUB>cosb=-1.47+/-0.37 and μ<SUB>b</SUB>=-1.07+/-0.38 mas yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, on the International Celestial Reference System by means of Hipparcos stars. Together with the radial velocity of 109 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and the assumed distance of 8 kpc, these results imply a space motion of (Π,Θ,W)=(-5+/-12, 188+/-10, -49+/-15) km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. While CMa has in-plane rotation similar to the mean of thick-disk stars, it shows significant (3 σ) motion perpendicular to the disk and differs even more (7 σ) from that expected for the Galactic warp. The W-velocity lends support to the argument that the CMa overdensity is part of a satellite-galaxy remnant., We present the first BVI CCD photometry to V= 22.0 of four fields centred on the region of the southern Galactic star clusters Ruprecht 61, Czernik 32, NGC 2225 and 2262 and of four displaced control fields. These clusters have never been studied before, and we provide for the first time estimates of their fundamental parameters, specifically radial extent, age, distance and reddening. We find that the four clusters are all of intermediate age (around 1Gyr), close to the Sun and possess lower than solar metal abundance., Using high-resolution SPH numerical simulations, we investigate the effects of gas on the in-spiral and merger of a massive black hole binary. This study is motivated by the very massive nuclear gas disks observed in the central regions of merging galaxies. Here we present results that expand on the treatment in a previous work by studying models in which the gas is in a disk. We run a variety of models, ranging from simulations with a relatively smooth gas disk to cases in which the gas has a more clumpy spatial distribution. We also vary the inclination angle between the plane of the binary and the plane of the disk, and the mass ratio between the MBHs and the gaseous disk. We find that, as in our previous work, in the early evolution of the system the binary separation diminishes mainly due to dynamical friction exerted by the background gas, and in the later stages the gaseous medium responds by forming an ellipsoidal density enhancement whose axis lags behind the binary axis. This offset produces a gravitational torque on the binary that causes continuing loss of angular momentum and is able to reduce the separation to distances at which gravitational radiation is efficient. The main difference is that between these two regimes we now find a new transition regime that was not apparent in our previous paper, in which the evolution is temporarily slowed down when neither of these mechanisms is fully effective. In the variety of simulations that we perform, we find that the coalescence timescale for the MBH binary varies between 5×10<SUP>6</SUP> and 2.5×10<SUP>7</SUP> yr for typical ULIRGs. For MBHs that satisfy the observed ``m-σ<SUB>c</SUB>'' relation, our simulations suggest that in a merger of galaxies that have at least 1% of their total mass in gas, the MBHs will coalesce soon after the galaxies merge., We compare a new 3D radiative hydrodynamical simulation of the surface layers of Procyon A to a similar 3D simulation of the surface layers of the Sun. Both simulations include realistic input physics and are performed using the same numerical techniques and computer codes. <P />Convection in the surface layers of Procyon A is very different from the Sun. Compared with the Sun, the atmospheric structure and convective flow in Procyon A exhibit the following characteristics. (i) The highly superadiabatic transition layer (SAL) is located at a much shallower optical depth; it is in a dynamically active region and its outer region is sometimes located in the optically thin atmosphere. (ii) The outer region of the SAL moves from an optically thin region to a thick region and back again over a time of 20-30 min. This motion, which is driven by the granulation, takes place in a time approximately half the turnover time of the largest granules. (iii) The peak rms velocity in the vertical direction is much larger in Procyon A. The main reason for the radically different radiative-convective behaviour in Procyon A compared with the Sun is the role played by turbulent eddies in determining the overall flow/thermal structure. The turbulent pressure and turbulent kinetic energy can exceed 50 per cent of the local gas pressure (compared with about 10-20 per cent in the Sun). In such regions, the mixing lengthy theory is a poor approximation. <P />The Procyon A simulation thus reveals two distinct time-scales: the autocorrelation time of the vertical velocity and the characteristic time-scale of the SAL, which is tied to granulation. Just below the surface, the autocorrelation decay time is about 5 min in Procyon A and the SAL motion time-scale is 20-30 min. In the simulations, the peak value of the superadiabaticity varies between 0.5 and 3. When the SAL penetrates the optically thin region, there are efficient radiative losses and the peak of the SAL is low. We speculate that these losses damp out the relative amplitudes in luminosity (temperature fluctuations) compared with velocity (Doppler). Although this will not affect the frequencies of the peaks in the power spectrum, it will probably lower the average amplitude of the peaks relative to the noise background., Mountain building depends on the disequilibrium between boundary stresses, either at the base of the deforming lithosphere or its lateral boundaries, and buoyancy stresses arising form lateral density variations within the lithosphere itself. On the basis of the thin viscous sheet approximation, we propose a model which accounts for both crustal and lithospheric thickness variations. The deformation is controlled by the sum of the moments of density anomalies (i.e. density anomalies times depth) of compositional and thermal origins. The transport of the compositional moment is obtained from the continuity equation while the transport of the thermal moment is obtained from the heat equation. The resulting set of equations controls the coupled behavior of the crust and lithosphere. It shows that various type of solutions can exist: unstable, stable and propagating. When propagation occurs, the crustal and the lithospheric thickness variations are out of phase. The tectonic waves propagate with velocities around 5 mm yr<SUP>-1</SUP> that increase with the crustal thickness and decrease with the lithospheric viscosity. We discuss these solutions and argue that continents may in large part be in a domain of propagating tectonic waves., We describe an approach to detecting ionizing radiation that combines the special properties of superfluid helium with the sensitivity of quantum optics techniques. Ionization in liquid helium results in the copious production of metastable He<SUB>2</SUB> molecules, which can be detected by laser-induced fluorescence. Each molecule can be probed many times using a cycling transition, resulting in the detection of individual molecules with high signal to noise. This technique could be used to detect neutrinos, weakly interacting massive particles, and ultracold neutrons, and to image superfluid flow in liquid He4., I present some selected parts of a recent analysis <SUP>1</SUP> in which we explore (and combine together) all possible effects due to sterile neutrinos; I focus here on cosmology (BBN, CMB, LSS) and supernovæ., Presented at a memorial symposium in honor of Dr. Janet A. Mattei, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA, October 29, 2004; received November 15, 2004; accepted December 28, 2004, A magnetic flux tube can be considered both as a separate body and as a confined field. As a field, it is affected by both differential rotation (Ω-effect) and cyclonic convection (α-effect). As a body, the tube experiences not only a buoyant force, but also a dynamic pressure due to downflows above the tube. These two competing dynamic effects are incorporated into the α-Ω dynamo equations through the total magnetic turbulent diffusivity, leading to a flux tube dynamo operating in the convection zone. We analyze and solve the extended dynamo equations in the linear approximation by adopting the observed solar internal rotation and assuming a downflow effect derived from numerical simulations of a solar convection zone. The model reproduces the 22 yr cycle period; the extended butterfly diagram with the confinement of strong activity to low heliographic latitudes |Φ|&lt;=35<SUP>deg</SUP> the evidence that at low latitudes the radial field is in an approximately π phase lag compared to the toroidal field at the same latitude; the evidence that the poleward branch is in a π/2 phase lag with respect to the equatorward branch; and the evidence that most of the magnetic flux is present in an intermittent form, concentrated into strong flux tubes., Wind accretion models of the X-ray luminosity in massive X-ray binaries (MXRBs) predict a class of ``quiet'' MXRBs in which the stellar wind is too weak to power a strong X-ray source. The first two candidates systems, HD 14633 and HD 15137, were recently detected. These O star + neutron star systems were ejected from the open cluster NGC 654, but although they both show evidence of a past supernova within the binary system, neither is a known X-ray emitter. These systems provide a new opportunity to examine the ejection mechanisms responsible for the OB runaway stars, and they can also provide key information about the evolution of spun-up, rejuvenated massive stars., We have been monitoring bright Trans-Neptunian objects with the SMARTS 1.3m telescope at CTIO to determine colors, solar phase curves, and rotation periods[1]. Here we present the first photometric observations of K40506A[2], currently the brightest and perhaps largest TNO, recently found with the Palomar Quest camera during our ongoing search for such objects[3]. The average V-band magnitude is 17.5 and the mean absolute magnitude is 0.44, about 1.5 magnitudes fainter than absolute magnitude of Pluto. We measure a neutral reflectance at visible wavelengths and a linear phase curve with slope varying from 0.11 mag/deg in the B band to 0.15 mag/deg in the I band. Our observations also reveal an unambiguous, double-peaked rotational lightcurve with period of 3.9152 hours and peak to peak amplitude 0.35 mag. Given the object's large size, this lightcurve is extraordinary. The double peaks in the lightcurve indicate an elongated object with large to small axis ratio of 1.4. We discuss the constraints these observations place on the body's size, strength, and density. [1] B. Schaefer, D. Rabinowitz, and S. Tourtellote, this proceedings. [2] K40506A is our own internal catalog name. [3] M. Brown, C. Trujillo, and D. Rabinowitz, 2004, Ap J 617. 546-649., We contrast two approaches to calculating trans-Planckian corrections to the inflationary perturbation spectrum: the new physics hypersurface (NPH) model, in which modes are normalized when their physical wavelength first exceeds a critical value, and the boundary effective field theory (BEFT) approach, where the initial conditions for all modes are set at the same time, and modified by higher-dimensional operators enumerated via an effective field theory calculation. We show that these two approaches—as currently implemented—lead to radically different expectations for the trans-Planckian corrections to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and emphasize that in the BEFT formalism we expect the perturbation spectrum to be dominated by quantum gravity corrections for all scales shorter than some critical value. Conversely, in the NPH case the quantum effects only dominate the longest modes that are typically much larger than the present horizon size. Furthermore, the onset of the breakdown in the standard inflationary perturbation calculation predicted by the BEFT formalism is likely to be associated with a feature in the perturbation spectrum, and we discuss the observational signatures of this feature in both CMB and large-scale structure observations. Finally, we discuss possible modifications to both calculational frameworks that would resolve the contradictions identified here., Wide-field BVI photometry and <SUP>12</SUP>CO(1--&gt;0) observations are presented in the region of the open cluster NGC 6520 and the dark molecular cloud Barnard 86. From the analysis of the optical data we find that the cluster is rather compact, with a radius of 1.0 arcmin +/-0.5 arcmin, smaller than previous estimates. The cluster age is 150+/-50 Myr, and the reddening E<SUB>B-V</SUB>=0.42+/-0.10. The distance from the Sun is estimated to be 1900+/-100 pc, which is larger than previous estimates. We finally derive basic properties of the dark nebula Barnard 86 on the assumption that it lies at the same distance as the cluster., We propose to study the morphologies and environments of 482 X-ray selected AGN host galaxies and a comparison sample of thousands of normal galaxies in the GEMS field, also known as the Extended Chandra Deep Field South {ECDFS}, a 30' x 30' field centered on the much smaller GOODS field. The AGN are selected from a recent deep Chandra survey of the ECDFS. The combination of HST, Chandra, Spitzer, and multi-band ground-based data in this field is unique apart from GOODS, and because the ECDFS is larger and shallower, it samples luminous quasars rather than the lower luminosity AGN found in GOODS. The HST data are critical for determining the AGN host morphologies, host galaxy evolution, and obscuration, up to z 1. We will compare the results for luminous quasars in the GEMS area to those obtained for low-luminosity AGN in the GOODS area, using identical measurement techniques. This study, combined with our ongoing work in the GOODS area, will determine whether AGN hosts are identical to normal galaxies or are significantly influenced by the nuclear activity., The results of a theoretical isotope mass balance model are presented for the time dependence of burial and weathering-plus-degassing fluxes within the combined long-term carbon and sulfur cycles. Averaged data for oceanic δ <SUP>13</SUP>C and δ <SUP>34</SUP>S were entered for every million years from 270 to 240 Ma (middle Permian to middle Triassic) to study general trends across the Permian-Triassic boundary. Results show a drop in the rate of global organic matter burial during the late Permian and a predominance of low values during the early-to-middle Triassic. This overall decrease with time is ascribed mainly to epochs of conversion of high biomass forests to low biomass herbaceous vegetation resulting in a decrease in the production of terrestrially derived organic debris. Additional contributions to lessened terrestrial carbon burial were increased aridity and a drop in sea level during the late Permian which led to smaller areas of low-lying coastal wetlands suitable for coal and peat deposition. Mirroring the drop in organic matter deposition was an increase in the burial of sedimentary pyrite, and a dramatic increase in the calculated global mean ratio of pyrite-S to organic-C. High S/C values resulted from an increase of deposition in marine euxinic basins combined with a decrease in the burial of low-pyrite associated terrestrial organic matter. The prediction of increased oceanic anoxia during the late Permian and early Triassic agrees with independent studies of the composition of sedimentary rocks. Weathering plus burial fluxes for organic carbon and pyrite sulfur were used to calculate changes in atmospheric oxygen. The striking result is a continuous drop in O <SUB>2</SUB> concentration from ∼30% to ∼13% over a twenty million year period. This drop was brought about mainly by a decrease in the burial of terrestrially derived organic matter. but with a possible contribution from the weathering of older organic matter on land. It must have exerted a considerable influence on animal evolution because of the role of O <SUB>2</SUB> in respiration. Some examples are the extinction of many vertebrates, loss of giant insects and amphibians, and the restriction of animals to low elevations. It is concluded that the extinction of plants may have contributed to the extinction of animals., We propose to make observations that directly test the proposition that globular clusters contain massive black holes. Our targets are the bulge globular clusters NGC 6388 and NGC 6441. These are probably among the most massive in the galaxy, but are understudied compared to more familiar objects such as M15. Our analysis suggests that these two clusters are the most likely to show unambiguous evidence for a central massive black hole if such things exist in globular clusters. The observations proposed will give us the first thorough kinematic and photometric studies of these two clusters. The combination of the two epochs will give us proper motions good to of order 6 km/s. In addition, they will provide us with the first good, deep, color-magnitude diagrams for these clusters. These diagrams will be used to investigate the make up of the stellar population in the clusters, to more firmly establish their distances, ages, and metallicities, and to search for a binary sequence., We propose to image in BVI with HST ACS the highly inclined Virgo cluster spiral galaxy NGC 4402, which is an outstanding example of a galaxy undergoing stripping of its ISM by an ICM-ISM interaction. Ground-based images at 0.5"" resolution appear to show active dust stripping, triggered star formation, and ablation of dense molecular clouds by the ICM wind. The near side of NGC 4402 contains the leading edge of interaction, giving us a relatively unobscured view of the processes which occur as the ICM wind impacts the ISM. High resolution HST B-I images of dust in NGC 4402 can reveal the fate of giant molecular clouds during a stripping event, including whether clouds above some size get left behind as the rest of the ISM is stripped from around them, how decoupled clouds become ablated by the ICM wind, and how the survival time varies with cloud mass. We will identify and estimate the ages of stars and star clusters in the stripped outer disk and halo, and from the spatial distributions of the younger objects, constrain the stripping history of the galaxy. Its proximity, orientation, stage of evolution, and direction of travel through the ICM make NGC 4402 an outstanding subject for a detailed HST study of ICM-ISM stripping. An in-depth study of this galaxy will provide new insight into the physical processes of ISM-ICM interactions and give us greater understanding of cluster galaxy evolution, both in Virgo and at higher redshifts., We present optical, H I, and radio continuum observations of the highly inclined Virgo Cluster Sc galaxy NGC 4402, which show evidence for ram pressure stripping and dense cloud ablation. Very Large Array H I and radio continuum maps show a truncated gas disk and emission to the northwest of the main disk emission. In particular, the radio continuum emission is asymmetrically extended to the north and skewed to the west. The Hα image shows numerous H II complexes along the southern edge of the gas disk, possibly indicating star formation triggered by the intracluster medium (ICM) pressure. Our BVR images at 0.5"" resolution obtained with the WIYN Tip-Tilt Imager show a remarkable dust lane morphology: at half the optical radius, the dust lane of the galaxy curves up and out of the disk, matching the H I morphology. Large dust plumes extend upward for ~1.5 kpc from luminous young star clusters at the southeast edge of the truncated gas disk. These star clusters are very blue, indicating very little dust reddening, which suggests dust blown away by an ICM wind at the leading edge of the interaction. To the south of the main ridge of interstellar material, where the galaxy is relatively clean of gas and dust, we have discovered 1 kpc long linear dust filaments with a position angle that matches the extraplanar radio continuum tail; we interpret this angle as the projected ICM wind direction. One of the observed dust filaments has an H II region at its head. We interpret these dust filaments as large, dense clouds that were initially left behind as the low-density interstellar medium was stripped but were then ablated by the ICM wind. These results provide striking new evidence on the fate of molecular clouds in stripped cluster galaxies., In this work we study the phenomenological consequences of the dependence of mass varying neutrinos on the neutrino density in the Sun, which we precisely compute in each point along the neutrino trajectory. We find that a generic characteristic of these scenarios is that they establish a connection between the effective Δm<SUP></SUP> in the Sun and the absolute neutrino mass scale. This does not lead to any new allowed region in the oscillation parameter space. On the contrary, due to this effect, the description of solar neutrino data worsens for large absolute mass. As a consequence a lower bound on the level of degeneracy can be derived from the combined analysis of the solar and KamLAND data. In particular this implies that the analysis favours normal over inverted mass orderings. These results, in combination with a positive independent determination of the absolute neutrino mass, can be used as a test of these scenarios together with a precise determination of the energy dependence of the survival probability of solar neutrinos, in particular for low energies., Both theoretical and empirical evidence shows that intracrystalline U-Th heterogeneity in zircon can lead to biases in (U-Th)/He ages if not accurately accounted for in α-ejection corrections. We present a model for age correction for U-Th zoned crystals. We apply this to spherical and prismatic grains with bipyramidal terminations. The spherical calculation is simplistic but allows rapid calculation of the approximate effects of a wide variety of U-Th zoning patterns. The bipyramidal calculation is computationally intensive but permits an more complete estimate of the combined effects of crystal morphology and source zoning as relevant to zircon. Our principle findings are: (1) the assumption of U-Th homogeneity can result in errors of up to ∼30% (in rare cases, higher) for ejection-corrected ages for typical grain sizes and realistic zonation. (2) Tetragonal prisms with bipyramidal terminations, which are typical of most zircons, exhibit bulk retentivities that can differ by several percent from models considering crystals with pinacoidal terminations. When extreme cases, such as dipyramids, are considered, the bias can exceed 10% or more. (3) Morphologic effects can be accounted for to better than 1% precision by using new second-order polynomial parameters that describe retentivity as a function of surface-area-to-volume ratio calculated through more complete analysis of crystal dimensions including the height of pyramidal crystal sections. We illustrate application of our model using U-Th concentration profiles determined from single zircons by laser ablation ICP-MS from zoned Tardree Rhyolite zircons., The dilute nature and compositional complexity of rainwater organic carbon (OC) has made it difficult to determine the role of rainwater OC in regional and global carbon budgets. Here I present the δ<SUP>13</SUP>C and Δ<SUP>14</SUP>C signatures of OC in rainfall, including two hurricanes, which indicate that OC in rain originates from multiple sources including a significant fraction from fossil fuels and marine OC. These samples demonstrate that atmospheric wet deposition of OC from fossil fuels can supply significant quantities of relic carbon to ecosystems. In addition, rainfall events that originate over the ocean can be dominated by marine OC, arguing for a significant transfer of marine OC to the continents and a large recycled marine OC component to marine rain. A conceptual model of the direct transfers of OC in rainfall concludes that the net transfer of continental OC to the ocean could be close to zero due to a significant marine to continental flux., A recent drilling leg on the Ontong Java Plateau and subsequent studies have consolidated the following observation for this gigantic oceanic plateau: The bulk of the plateau was formed at ∼ 120 Ma in a submarine environment. This rapid construction of a massive igneous body below sea level is impossible to explain with the popular plume head hypothesis. Though the bolide impact hypothesis for oceanic plateaus has recently been resurrected to offer an alternative, it is shown here that it fails to explain submarine eruption for exactly the same reason why the plume hypothesis fails. As a more dynamically promising model, the entrainment of dense fertile mantle by rapid seafloor spreading is proposed to account for voluminous magmatism in the submarine environment. It is also suggested that this chemically dense source mantle may naturally explain the anomalous subsidence history of this plateau as well as minor magmatism observed at ∼ 90 Ma. Modeling the dynamics of compositionally heterogeneous mantle and its geochemical consequences remains as a challenging yet rewarding problem in mantle dynamics and igneous petrology., The beta-decay of <SUP>85</SUP>Kr is a significant radioactive background for experiments that use liquified noble gases to search for dark matter and measure the low-energy solar neutrino flux. While there are several proposed methods for reducing Kr levels in these experiments, an independent technique is needed for measuring very low Kr levels. By selectively exciting Kr atoms to a metastable state, capturing them in a magneto-optical trap (MOT), and detecting fluorescence from the trapped atoms, individual Kr atoms can be counted with a high signal-to-noise ratio. This approach could be used to ascertain Kr impurity levels in other noble gases, with an estimated sensitivity of 3×10<SUP></SUP>., The concept of spectrum generating superalgebras and associated dynamic supersymmetries is introduced and placed within the general context of symmetry in physics. The discovery of dynamic supersymmetry in nuclei and its recent confirmation in <SUP>l96</SUP>Au is presented., We present wide-field deep {UBVI} photometry for the previously unstudied open cluster NGC 4852 down to a limiting magnitude I∼24, obtained from observations taken with the Wide Field Imager camera on-board the MPG/ESO 2.2 m telescope at La Silla (ESO, Chile). These data are used to obtain the first estimate of the cluster basic parameters, to study the cluster spatial extension by means of star counts, and to derive the Luminosity (LF) and Mass Function (MF). The cluster radius turns out to be 5.0±1.0 arcmin. The cluster emerges clearly from the field down to V=20 mag. At fainter magnitudes, it is completely confused with the general Galactic disk field. The stars inside this region define a young open cluster (200 million years old) 1.1 kpc far from the Sun (m-M = 11.60, E(B-V) = 0.45). The Present Day Mass Functions (PDMF) from the V photometry is one of the most extended in mass obtained to date, and can be represented as a power-law with a slope α = 2.3±0.3 and (the Salpeter MF in this notation has a slope α = 2.35), in the mass range 3.2 ≤ {m}/{m<SUB>⊙</SUB>} ≤ 0.6. Below this mass, the MF cannot be considered as representative of the cluster MF, as the cluster merges with the field and therefore the MF is the result of the combined effect of strong irregularities in the stellar background and interaction of the cluster with the dense Galactic field. The cluster total mass at the limiting magnitude results to be 2570±210 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>., We report on BVI CCD photometry to V= 22.0 for three fields centred on the region of the Galactic star clusters Ruprecht 4, Ruprecht 7 and Pismis 15 and on three displaced control fields. Ruprecht 4 and Pismis 15 have never been studied before, and we provide, for the first time, estimates of their fundamental parameters, namely, radial extent, age, distance and reddening. Ruprecht 7 (Berkeley 33), however, was studied by Mazur, Kaluzny &amp; Krzeminski. We find that the three clusters are all of intermediate age (0.8-1.3 Gyr), and with a metallicity close to or lower than solar., We have modeled the effect of changes in the shape of the spectral line used for the GONG and MDI observations, and we investigate the consequences for measurements of properties of oscillations and flares. We find that magnetic field measurements are not very sensitive to line shape changes, but velocity estimates do strongly depend on line variations. Using simulated observations of a flare we find that recently observed associated magnetic field changes are not due to line shape changes. On the other hand, a simulation of an oscillation indicates that at least part of the observed amplitude suppression in an active region is due to variations in the line shape. We also report preliminary results of the effect of vertical phase variations across the line profile on the helioseismic observations. This work is carried out through the National Solar Observatory Research Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) site program, which is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the National Science Foundation REU Program. This work utilizes data obtained by the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) project, managed by the National Solar Observatory, which is operated by AURA, Inc. under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation. The data were acquired by instruments operated by the Big Bear Solar Observatory, High Altitude Observatory, Learmonth Solar Observatory, Udaipur Solar Observatory, Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias, and Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory., Using a 33 MeV proton beam with our Enge split-pole spectrograph, we measured the Q<SUB>0</SUB> values of the <SUP>24</SUP>Mg(p,t)<SUP>22</SUP>Mg and <SUP>28</SUP>Si(p,t)<SUP>26</SUP>Si reactions relative to that of the <SUP>16</SUP>O(p,t)<SUP>14</SUP>O reaction. Data were obtained at scattering angles of 15<SUP>°</SUP> and 25<SUP>°</SUP>. Based on the masses of <SUP>24</SUP>Mg, <SUP>28</SUP>Si, <SUP>16</SUP>O, <SUP>14</SUP>O,p, and t, we determined the mass excesses of <SUP>22</SUP>Mg and <SUP>26</SUP>Si to be -400.5(1.0) and -7139.5(1.0) keV, respectively. Our result for the mass of <SUP>22</SUP>Mg is in excellent agreement with recent high-precision measurements., We present Hubble Space Telescope ACS images of the Virgo cluster spiral galaxy NGC 4522, one of the nearest and clearest cases for ongoing ram pressure stripping of a galaxy's ISM by an interaction with the gas in the intracluster medium. The images show extraplanar star clusters which formed from stripped gas, large-scale dust lanes leaving the plane of the stellar disk, and small-scale head-tail dust features, which we propose are dense gas clouds being ablated by the ICM wind after the low density ISM has been stripped., We take advantage of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field data to study the rest-frame optical and UV morphologies of the novel population of distant red galaxies (DRGs). Six galaxies with J-K<SUB>s</SUB>&gt;2.3 are found to K<SUB>s</SUB>=21.5, five of which have photometric redshifts z<SUB>phot</SUB>&gt;~2, corresponding to a surface density of 0.9 arcmin<SUP>-2</SUP>. The surface brightness distributions of the z<SUB>phot</SUB>&gt;~2 galaxies are better represented by exponential disks than R<SUP>1/4</SUP> laws. Two of the z<SUB>phot</SUB>&gt;~2 galaxies are extended, while three have compact morphologies. The rest-frame optical morphology of the z<SUB>phot</SUB>&gt;~2 galaxies is quite different from the rest-frame UV morphology: All the galaxies have red central components that dominate in the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) H<SUB>160</SUB>-band images, as well as distinct off-center blue features that show up in (and often dominate) the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) images. The mean measured effective radius of the z<SUB>phot</SUB>&gt;~2 galaxies is &lt;r<SUB>e</SUB>&gt;=1.9+/-1.4 kpc, similar (within the errors) to the mean size of Lyman break galaxies at similar redshifts. All the DRGs are resolved in the ACS images, while four are resolved in the NICMOS images. Two of the z<SUB>phot</SUB>&gt;~2 galaxies are bright X-ray sources and hence host active galactic nuclei (AGNs). One of these galaxies is resolved in the ACS and NICMOS images, which means that the AGN does not dominate its rest-frame UV/optical spectral energy distribution (SED), while the other is unresolved in the NICMOS images and hence could have an AGN-dominated SED. The diverse rest-frame optical and UV morphological properties of DRGs derived here suggest that they have complex stellar populations consisting of both evolved populations, which dominate the mass and the rest-frame optical light, and younger populations that show up as patches of star formation in the rest-frame UV light, in many ways resembling the properties of normal local galaxies. This interpretation is supported by fits to the broadband SEDs, which for all five z<SUB>phot</SUB>&gt;~2 galaxies are best represented by models with extended star formation histories and substantial amounts of dust. <P />Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc, under NASA contract NAS 5-26555., We examine the constraints cosmological observations can place on any trans-Planckian corrections to the primordial spectrum of perturbations underlying the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background. We focus on models of trans-Planckian physics which lead to a modulated primordial spectrum. Rather than looking at a generic modulated spectrum, we base our calculations on a specific model, and they are intended as a case study for the sort of constraints one could hope to apply to a well-motivated model of trans-Planckian physics. We present results for three different approaches—a grid search in a subset of the overall parameter space, a Fisher matrix estimation of the likely error ellipses, and a Monte Carlo Markov chain fit to a simulated CMB sky. As was seen in previous analyses, the likelihood space has multiple peaks, and we show that their distribution can be reproduced via a simple semi-analytic argument. All three methods lead to broadly similar results. We vary ten cosmological parameters (including two related to the trans-Planckian terms) and show that the amplitude of the tensor perturbations is directly correlated with the detectability of any trans-Planckian modulation. We argue that this is likely to be true for any trans-Planckian modulation in the paradigm of slow roll inflation. For the specific case we consider, we conclude that if the tensor to scalar ratio r~0.15, the ratio between the inflationary Hubble scale H and the scale of new physics M has to be of the order of 0.004 if the modulation is detectable at the 2σ level. For a lower value of r, the bound on H/M becomes looser., We present results on the structure of the near-surface layers of the Sun. These results were obtained by inverting frequencies of high-degree solar modes obtained by using ""ring diagrams"". We have results for seven epochs from June 1996 to March 2002. The frequencies of each epoch were obtained from ring diagrams constructed from MDI Dopplergrams spanning one complete Carrington rotation. We find that there is a substantial latitudinal variation of both sound speed and the adiabatic index Γ1 in the outer 2% of the Sun. In addition, it appears that both the sound-speed and Γ1 profiles change with change in the level of solar activity., We present a 3D radiative-hydrodynamical simulation of the surface layers of Procyon A, and compare it to a similar simulation for the Sun. Procyon has a thin outer convection zone, and its atmosphere, like the solar atmosphere, is characterized by granulation. Procyon granules are much larger than in the Sun, with a mean diameter near 10,000 km, in comparison with 1,200 km for a solar granule. The dynamics of the Procyon atmosphere differ from the solar atmosphere dynamics in fundamental ways: (1) the ratio of turbulent to gas pressure is larger in the Procyon atmosphere (2) the highly superadiabatic transition layer (SAL) is located at much shallower optical depth (3) the location of the SAL maximum moves back and forth in the atmosphere, from an optically thin to optically thick region in a quasi-periodic manner. This motion is driven by the penetration of granules into the outermost atmospheric layers while they overturn. The timescale of this phenomenon is roughly half the full granule lifetime (which is typically in the range of 40 to 60 minutes); (3) the maximum temperature contrast at a given optical depth varies rapidly on a short timescale resulting in locally large radiative losses and strong intensity contrasts (hot spots). The simulation also shows that the autocorrelation timescale in Procyon's atmosphere is favorable to the stochastic excitation of p-modes by turbulence. However highly efficient radiative damping in Procyon's atmosphere is likely to result in much shorter p-mode coherence lifetimes than in the Sun. <P />This research was supported in part by NASA grant NAG5-13299 (PD), the NASA EOS/IDS Program (FJR), NSERC of Canada (DBG) and the Korea Research Foundation grant KRF-2003-015-C00249 (YCK)., We describe a technique to identify Be stars in open clusters using Strömgren b, y, and narrowband Hα photometry. We first identify the B-type stars of the cluster using a theoretical isochrone fit to the (b-y, y) color-magnitude diagram. The strongest Be stars are easily identified in a (b-y, y-Hα) color-color diagram, but those with weaker Hα emission (classified as possible Be star detections) may be confused with evolved or foreground stars. Here we present such photometry plus Hα spectroscopy of members of the cluster NGC 3766 to demonstrate the accuracy of our technique. Statistical results on the relative numbers of Be and B-type stars in additional clusters will be presented in a future paper., We study the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) morphologies of M3 and M13 using high-precision Hubble Space Telescope photometry. Asymmetric broadening above and to the red of the main sequence is apparent. We use extensive artificial star experiments to synthetically reproduce chance superposition and photometric error and examine whether a main-sequence binary population is required to account for the observed asymmetric broadening. We find that the most probable binary fraction f<SUB>b</SUB> in the center of M3 lies between 6% and 22%. For those stars of M3 with distances from the cluster center between 1 and 2 core radii, the most probable value of f<SUB>b</SUB> lies between 1% and 3%. The similar radial distributions of binaries and blue stragglers (BSs) support the model that the BSs in the center of M3 are of collisional origin. A similar comparison between the color distributions of real stars and artificial stars in the CMD of M13 suggests that the real star distributions are consistently broader than the artificial ones. After corrections of real and artificial differences in color uncertainties, we find evidence for an intrinsic color dispersion among main-sequence stars of about 0.013-0.014 mag in both the center and outer regions of M13. This is larger than the expected value resulting from the spectroscopically observed [Fe/H] dispersion and might reflect differences in [C/Fe] and [N/Fe] that have been noted spectroscopically among upper main-sequence stars in M13. <P />Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555. These observations are associated with programs GO-6805 and GO-8278., We discuss the nature of eleven Possible Open Cluster Remnants (POCRs) by using absolute proper motions from the Southern Proper Motion (SPM) Program 3 (Girard et al. [CITE], AJ, 127, 3060) combined with near infrared photometry from 2MASS. The analysis is done by considering the distribution of stars in the Color-Magnitude and the Vector Point diagrams. We successfully probed the capabilities of the SPM catalog to detect a physical group by looking at the open cluster Blanco 1. However, within the uncertainties of the SPM3 catalog and basing on 2MASS photometry we conclude that only one - ESO 282SC26 - out of eleven objects turns out to be a probable physical group. We suggest it is an open cluster 1.3 Gyr old and located 1.4 kpc from the Sun., Recent tomographic imaging of thick plume conduits in the lower mantle, when combined with plume buoyancy flux based on hotspot swell topography, indicates a very high plume viscosity of 10 <SUP>21</SUP>-10 <SUP>23</SUP> Pa s. This estimated plume viscosity is comparable or may even be greater than the viscosity of the bulk lower mantle, the estimate of which ranges from 2×10 <SUP>21</SUP> to 10 <SUP>22</SUP> Pa s. Here I show that both very high viscosity and large radii of lower-mantle plumes can be simultaneously explained if the temperature dependency of lower-mantle rheology is dominated by the grain size-dependent part of diffusion creep, i.e., hotter mantle has higher viscosity. Fluid-dynamical scaling laws of a thermal boundary layer suggest that the thickness and topography of the D″ discontinuity are consistent with such mantle rheology. This new kind of plume dynamics may also explain why plumes appear to be fixed in space despite background mantle flow and why plume excess temperature is only up to 200-300 K whereas the temperature difference at the core-mantle boundary is likely to exceed 1000 K., Recent studies have shown that K-luminous galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;2.5 have high Hα line widths and high [N II] λ6583/Hα ratios. If these lines arise from photoionization by massive stars in H II regions, these results imply that massive, metal-rich galaxies exist at high redshift. Here we investigate the ionization mechanism in a galaxy with K<SUB>s</SUB>=19.1 and z=2.225 in the Chandra Deep Field-South, using the new Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS). GNIRS's cross-dispersed mode gives simultaneous access to the entire 1-2.5 μm wavelength range, allowing accurate measurements of line ratios of distant galaxies. From the ratio of Hα/Hβ, we infer that the line-emitting gas is heavily obscured, with E(B-V)=0.8<SUP>+0.3</SUP><SUB>-0.2</SUB>. The reddening is higher than that inferred previously from the UV-optical continuum emission, consistent with findings for nearby starburst galaxies. We find that the galaxy has Seyfert-like line ratios, [N II]/Hα~0.6 and [O III] λ5007/Hβ~6, which can be caused by photoionization by an active galactic nucleus (AGN) or shock ionization due to a strong galactic wind. Although we cannot exclude the presence of an AGN, the lack of AGN spectral features in the rest-frame ultraviolet, the consistency of radio, X-ray, and rest-frame UV star formation indicators, the fact that the [O III]/Hβ ratio remains high out to ~10 kpc from the nucleus, and the observed gas kinematics all argue for the wind hypothesis. Similar shock-induced ionization is seen in nearby starburst galaxies with strong winds, such as NGC 1482 and NGC 3079. The evidence for shock ionization implies that measurements of metallicities and dynamical masses of star-forming z&gt;2 galaxies should be regarded with caution, especially since the existence of strong galactic winds in these objects is well established. Based on Sloan Digital Sky Survey data for nearby galaxies and the limited data available at high redshift, we speculate that the effects of shocks may correlate with dust content. The results presented here demonstrate the importance of measuring the full rest-frame optical spectra of high-redshift galaxies and showcase the potential of GNIRS for such studies. <P />Based on observations obtained at the Gemini Observatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under a cooperative agreement with the NSF on behalf of the Gemini partnership., , We present new experimental results on the mechanisms through which steady two-dimensional density currents lead to the formation of a stratification in a closed basin. A motivation for this work is to test the underlying assumptions in a diffusive “filling box” model that describes the oceanic thermohaline circulation (Hughes, G.O. and Griffiths, R.W., A simple convective model of the global overturning circulation, including effects of entrainment into sinking regions, Ocean Modeling, 2005, submitted.). In particular, they hypothesized that a non-uniform upwelling velocity is due to weak along-slope entrainment in density currents associated with a large horizontal entrainment ratio of Eeq?~?0.1. We experimentally measure the relationship between the along-slope entrainment ratio, E, of a density current to the horizontal entrainment ratio, Eeq, of an equivalent vertical plume. The along-slope entrainment ratios show the same quantitative decrease with slope as observed by Ellison and Turner (Ellison, T.H. and Turner, J.S., Turbulent entrainment in stratified flows, J. Fluid Mech., 1959, 6, 423-448.), whereas the horizontal entrainment ratio Eeq appears to asymptote to a value of Eeq?=?0.08 at low slopes. Using the measured values of Eeq we show that two-dimensional density currents drive circulations that are in good agreement with the two-dimensional filling box model of Baines and Turner (Baines, W.D. and Turner, J.S., Turbulent buoyant convection from a source in a confined region, J. Fluid. Mech., 1969, 37, 51-80.). We find that the vertical velocities of density fronts collapse onto their theoretical prediction that U =-2-2/3B1/3Eeq2/3 (H/R) ?, where U is the velocity, H the depth, B the buoyancy flux, R the basin width, Eeq the horizontal entrainment ratio and???= z/H the dimensionless depth. The density profiles are well fitted with???= 2-1/3B2/3Eeq-2/3H-1 [ln(? )?+?t ], where?t?is the dimensionless time. Finally, we provide a simple example of a diffusive filling box model, where we show how the density stratification of the deep Caribbean waters (below 1850?m depth) can be described by a balance between a steady two-dimensional entraining density current and vertical diffusion in a triangular basin., We present a study of the spectroscopic and photometric properties of galaxies in six nearby clusters. We perform a partial correlation analysis on our data set to investigate whether the correlation between star formation rates in galaxies and their environment is merely another aspect of correlations of morphology, stellar mass, or mean stellar age with environment, or whether star formation rates vary independently of these other correlations. We find a residual correlation of ongoing star formation with environment, indicating that even galaxies with similar morphologies, stellar masses, and mean stellar ages have lower star formation rates in denser environments. Thus, the current star formation gradient in clusters is not just another aspect of the morphology-density, stellar mass-density, or mean stellar age-density relations. Furthermore, the star formation gradient cannot be solely the result of initial conditions, but must partly be due to subsequent evolution through a mechanism (or mechanisms) sensitive to environment. Our results constitute a true ``smoking gun'' pointing to the effect of environment on the later evolution of galaxies., We present the first results from the Calán-Yale Deep Extragalactic Research (CYDER) survey. The main goal of this survey is to study serendipitous X-ray sources detected by Chandra in an intermediate flux range (10<SUP>-15</SUP> to 10<SUP>-12</SUP> ergs s<SUP>-1</SUP>) that comprises most of the X-ray background. A total of 267 X-ray sources spread over five archived fields were detected. The logN-logS distribution obtained for this sample is consistent with the results of other surveys. Deep V and I images were taken of these fields in order to calculate X-ray-to-optical flux ratios. Identifications and redshifts were obtained for 106 sources using optical spectroscopy from 8 m class telescopes to reach the optically faintest sources, to the same level as deeper X-ray fields like the Chandra Deep Fields, showing that the nature of sources detected depends mostly on the optical limit for spectroscopy. In general, sources optically classified as obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have redder optical colors than unobscured AGNs. A rough correlation between f<SUB>X</SUB>/fopt and hard X-ray luminosity was found for obscured AGNs, confirming the prediction by existing models that in obscured AGNs the optical light is completely dominated by the host galaxy. The previously claimed decrease of the obscured-to-unobscured AGN ratio with increasing X-ray luminosity is observed. However, this correlation can be explained as a selection effect caused by the lower optical flux of obscured AGNs. Comparison between the observed N<SUB>H</SUB> distribution and predictions by existing models shows that the sample appears complete up to N<SUB>H</SUB>&lt;3×10<SUP>22</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, while for more obscured sources incompleteness plays an important role in the observed obscured-to-unobscured AGN ratio. <P />Partly based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile, under programs 68.A-0459 and 72.A-0509., The structure of the oceanic crust conforms in general to a very simple model. However, fine-scale variations of this structure in anomalous regions (such as beneath oceanic islands) remain poorly resolved. Here we examine teleseismic receiver functions (RFs) computed at four permanent broadband seismic stations on islands in the Pacific region. The RF method is ideal for examining the fine structure of the crust because it is sensitive to the interfaces between layers, though less sensitive to average wave speed. RFs at these oceanic island stations are characterized by a train of Ps conversions from shallow depths, rather than the isolated Moho conversion typically seen at continental stations. We find that a simple three-layer structure (the old oceanic crust sandwiched between an extruded volcanic layer and an underplated layer) explains the main features of the RFs. Our data indicate that oceanic islands share a common structure, a principal feature of which is crustal underplating, with a total crustal thickness of 11-20 km., We study string dynamics in the early universe. Our motivation is the proposal of Brandenberger and Vafa that string winding modes may play a key role in decompactifying three spatial dimensions. We model the universe as a homogeneous but anisotropic nine-torus filled with a gas of excited strings. We adopt initial conditions which fix the dilaton and the volume of the torus, but otherwise assume all states are equally likely. We study the evolution of the system both analytically and numerically to determine the late-time behaviour. We find that, although dynamical evolution can indeed lead to three large spatial dimensions, such an outcome is not statistically favoured., We perform a thorough analysis of oscillation signals generated by one extra sterile neutrino, extending previous analyses done in simple limiting cases and including the effects of established oscillations among active neutrinos. We consider the following probes: solar, atmospheric, reactor and beam neutrinos, big-bang nucleosynthesis (helium-4, deuterium), cosmic microwave background, large scale structure, supernovæ, neutrinos from other astrophysical sources. We find no evidence for a sterile neutrino in present data, identify the still allowed regions, and study which future experiments can best probe them: sub-MeV solar experiments, more precise studies of CMB or BBN, future supernova explosions, etc. We discuss how the LSND hint is strongly disfavoured by the constraints of (standard) cosmology., The recent X-ray and CO observations of RX J1713.7-3946 show that a significant fraction of the nonthermal X-ray emission of this unique supernova remnant associates, in one way or another, with a molecular cloud interacting with the west part of the shell. This adds a new puzzle in the origin of X-ray emission which cannot be easily explained within the standard model in accordance of which X-rays are result of synchrotron radiation of multi-TeV electrons accelerated by strong shock waves. We explore an alternative origin of the X-ray emission assuming that it is produced by secondary-e<SUP>+/-</SUP> resulting from high energy hadronic interactions in the molecular gas. Such a scenario could explain in a quite natural way the apparent correlation between the X-ray and CO morphologies. However, the TeV γ-ray emission recently reported by H.E.S.S. significantly constraints the parameter space of this model. Namely, this mechanism cannot reproduce the bulk of the observed X-ray flux unless one postulates existence of a PeV cosmic-ray component penetrating with an unusually hard spectrum into the dense cloud., The boron isotope- pH technique is founded on a theoretical model of carbonate δ <SUP>11</SUP>B variation with pH that assumes that the boron isotopic composition of carbonates mirrors the boron isotopic composition of borate in solution (δ <SUP>11</SUP>B <SUB>carb</SUB> = δ <SUP>11</SUP>B <SUB>borate</SUB>). Knowledge of the fractionation factor for isotope exchange between boric acid and borate in solution (α <SUB>4-3</SUB>), the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of boric acid ( pK <SUB>B</SUB>*), as well as the isotopic composition of boron in seawater (δ <SUP>11</SUP>B <SUB>sw</SUB>) are required parameters of the model. The available data suggests that both the value of α <SUB>4-3</SUB> and the history of δ <SUP>11</SUP>B <SUB>sw</SUB> are poorly constrained. However, if one assumes that δ <SUP>11</SUP>B <SUB>carb</SUB> = δ <SUP>11</SUP>B <SUB>borate</SUB>, an empirical value for α <SUB>4-3</SUB> can be estimated from the results of inorganic carbonate precipitation experiments. This exercise yields an α <SUB>4-3</SUB> value of ∼0.974 in accordance with recent theoretical estimates, but substantially deviates from the theoretical value of 0.981 often used to estimate paleo-ocean pH. Re-evaluation of ocean pH using an α <SUB>4-3</SUB> value of 0.974 and published foraminiferal δ <SUP>11</SUP>B values for the Cenozoic yield pH estimates that are relatively invariant, but unrealistically high (∼8.4-8.6). Uncertainty increases as foraminiferal 'vital effects' are considered and different models for secular changes in seawater δ <SUP>11</SUP>B are applied. The inability to capture realistic ocean pH possibly reflects on our understanding of the isotopic relationship between carbonate and borate, as well as the mechanism of boron incorporation in carbonates. Given the current understanding of boron systematics, pH values estimated using this technique have considerable uncertainty, particularly when reconstructions exceed the residence time of boron in the ocean., This article describes CLEAN, an approach to the detection of low-energy solar neutrinos and neutrinos released from supernovae. The CLEAN concept is based on the detection of elastic scattering events (neutrino-electron scattering and neutrino-nuclear scattering) in liquified noble gases such as liquid helium, liquid neon, and liquid xenon, all of which scintillate brightly in the ultraviolet. Key to the CLEAN technique is the use of a thin film of wavelength-shifting fluor to convert the ultraviolet scintillation light to the visible, thereby allowing detection by conventional photomultipliers. <P />Liquid neon is a particularly promising medium for CLEAN. Because liquid neon has a high scintillation yield, has no long-lived radioactive isotopes, and can be easily purified by use of cold traps, it is an ideal medium for the detection of rare nuclear events. In addition, neon is inexpensive, dense, and transparent to its own scintillation light, making it practical for use in a large self-shielding apparatus. The central region of a full-sized detector would be a stainless steel tank holding approximately 135 metric tons of liquid neon. Inside the tank and suspended in the liquid neon would be several thousand photomultipliers. <P />Monte Carlo simulations of gamma ray backgrounds have been performed assuming liquid neon as both shielding and detection medium. Gamma ray events occur with high probability in the outer parts of the detector. In contrast, neutrino scattering events occur uniformly throughout the detector. We discriminate background gamma ray events from events of interest based on a spatial maximum likelihood method estimate of event location. Background estimates for CLEAN are presented, as well as an evaluation of the sensitivity of the detector for p-p neutrinos. Given these simulations, the physics potential of the CLEAN approach is evaluated., 26 Al is the source of the first gamma-ray line observed in the Galaxy. It provides evidence of ongoing nucleosynthesis, and can potentially serve as a probe of nucleosynthesis in novae, supernovae, and massive stars. A better knowledge of the reaction rates involved in its creation and destruction will improve models of stellar production of 26 Al and make it possible to compare the predictions of those models to observations, improving our knowledge of stellar evolution. The fate of 26 A1 is complicated by its structure: the first excited state is an isomer (J p = 0 + , t 1/2 = 6.345 s) with a very much shorter beta-decay half-life than the ground state (J p = 5 + , t 1/2 = <P />7.4 x 10 5 y). Because the two states do not come into true thermal equilibrium, even at the high temperatures of astrophysical plasmas, it is necessary to treat the reactions involving the isomer separately from those involving the ground state. Up until now, however, there has been no experimental information on reactions involving the metastable state. This experiment represents the first data on the 26 Al m (p,g) 27 Si reaction. We populated excited states in 27 Si by means of the 27 Al( 3 He,t) 27 Si reaction, and observed the subsequent proton decays using a pair of position-sensitive silicon strip detectors which together covered 40% of the solid angle of the outgoing particles. <P />Decays to the ground, isomeric, and second excited states of 26 Al were measured, and levels in 27 Si that are resonances for 26 Al g (p,g) 27 Si, 26 Al m (p,g) 27 Si, and 26 Al * (p,g) 27 Si were identified. The consequences for reaction rates in astrophysical environments are discussed., The solar interior contains a variable magnetic field produced by the dynamo effect. This field contributes to the internal pressure and energy, and modifies the convective flows, thus affecting convective and turbulent energy transport. As a consequence, it modifies the structure of the solar interior, and thus all the global (stellar) parameters. Although these variations are inevitable, the amplitude of the changes depend critically on largely unknown properties of the fields, such as location, strength, configuration, etc. Thus, the field properties must be inferred from the observed changes of the global parameters, and they can be tested by helioseismological observations. We will describe the current codes that model these features of the solar interior, the current status of the observations, and the work both in the models and in the observations necessary to provide a robust understanding of the solar variability produced by internal processes., We have determined the absolute proper motion of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr) from the Southern Proper Motion Catalog 3, by selecting red giant candidates from the Two Micron All Sky Survey. We obtain μ<SUB>l</SUB>cosb=-2.35+/-0.20 and μ<SUB>b</SUB>=2.07+/-0.20 mas yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Using the same procedure, we also determine the absolute proper motion of the bulge in the region of the sky that overlaps with Sgr. For the bulge, we obtain μ<SUB>l</SUB>cosb=-5.86+/-0.14 and μ<SUB>b</SUB>=-0.59+/-0.14 mas yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, at l=7.6d and b=-21.2d. The absolute proper motions are on the International Celestial Reference System via Hipparcos Catalog stars., Using a simple unification model for AGN, with a fixed ratio of obscured to unobscured AGN of 3:1, we explain the X-ray, optical and infrared properties of the X-ray sources in the GOODS fields. That is, the GOODS data are consistent with the existence of a large population of obscured AGN out to high redshifts. About half of these are so obscured that they are missed even by hard X-ray observations, and are detected only in deep infrared observations. The previously reported decreasing trend of obscured to total AGN ratio with increasing X-ray luminosity can be explained entirely as a selection effect., It is suggested that the thermal physics of star-forming clouds may play a more important role than has usually been recognized in the origin of the stellar IMF and in determining a characteristic mass scale. The importance of the thermal physics has been clearly demonstrated for the formation of the first stars in the universe, where it is well understood and results in cooling to a characteristic minimum temperature at a preferred density, and hence in a characteristic scale for fragmentation. In present-day star-forming clouds, an analogous situation may exist in that at low densities the temperature is expected to decrease with increasing density, reaching a minimum when the gas becomes thermally coupled to the dust and then rising slowly at higher densities. A minimum temperature of about 5 K is predicted to occur at a density of the order of 10^(-18) g cm^(-3), and at this point the Jeans mass is about 0.3 solar masses, similar to the mass at which the IMF peaks. If most of the fragmentation in star-forming clouds occurs in filaments, as is suggested by many simulations as well as by observations, fragmentation seems likely to occur preferentially at the density where the temperature reaches a minimum, and the Jeans mass at this point may then determine a characteristic scale for fragmentation and hence a preferred stellar mass., We analysed the optical and infrared properties of X-ray sources in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS), a deep, multiwavelength survey covering 0.1 square degrees in two fields. The HST ACS data <P />Based on observations obtained with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555., CLEAN is an approach to the detection of weakly interacting particles of astrophysical significance, combining large mass and low energy threshold. Preliminary measurements have been made of the time response of the scintillation light due to β energy deposition. We have measured two distinct time constants corresponding to the singlet and triplet states of liquid neon., Using high-resolution SPH numerical simulations, we investigate the effects of gas on the inspiral and merger of a massive black hole binary. This study is motivated by the very massive nuclear gas disks observed in the central regions of merging galaxies. Here we present results that expand on the treatment in a previous work [1], by studying more realistic models in which the gas is in a disk with significant clumpiness. In the variety of simulations that we perform, we find that gravitational drag is able to reduce the separation to distances where gravitational radiation is efficient in a timescale that varies between 5× 10<SUP>6</SUP> yr and 2.5× 10<SUP>7</SUP> yr., Elastic light scattering from a single non-spherical particle of various morphologies has been measured simultaneously with a large angular range (90° &lt; θ &lt; 165° and 0° &lt; phi &lt; 360°) and with high angular resolution (1024 pixels in θ and 512 pixels in phi). Because the single-shot laser pulse is short (pulse duration of 70 ns), the tumbling and flowing particle can be treated as frozen in space. The large angle two-dimensional angular optical scattering (hereafter referred to as LA TAOS) intensity pattern, I(θ,phi), has been measured for a variety of particle morphology, such as the following: (1) single polystyrene latex (PSL) sphere; (2) cluster of PSL spheres; (3) single Bacillus subtilis (BG) spore; (4) cluster of BG spores; (5) dried aggregates of bio-aerosols as well as background clutter aerosols. All these measurements were made using the second harmonic of a Nd:YAG laser (0.532 μm). Islands structures in the LA TAOS patterns seem to be the prominent feature. Efforts are being made to extract metrics from these islands and compare them to theoretical results based on the T-matrix method., A variable (dynamo) magnetic field in the solar interior induces structural changes that result in variations of the global solar parameters (luminosity, radius, and temperature). Of course, as the luminosity changes, so does the basic level of the TSI, which is additionally modulated by surface magnetic activity (spots, faculae, and network). Since the energy reservoir for this internal process is very large, the mechanism can produce TSI modulation over very long timescales, depending only on the properties of the driving magnetic field. In other words, if the dynamo field undergoes secular changes (e.g. Gleissberg cycle or Maunder-type minima), the TSI will also undergo modulation having the same timescales. This paper will describe the current evidence in support of the operation of this mechanism, and how it is currently modeled. In addition, it will describe what observational and theoretical improvements need to be made to produce a model sufficiently robust to explain past change, and to forecast its future effect on climate., We model the X-ray, optical, and mid-infrared flux distributions of AGN in the GOODS fields, starting from hard X-ray luminosity functions and spectral energy distributions appropriate to the unified scheme for AGN. Assuming roughly 3 times as many obscured as unobscured AGN, this model is able to reproduce the observed distributions and statistical properties of the X-ray sources in the GOODS fields and at the same time is consistent with both the spectral shape and normalization of the X-ray background. This model also predicts that only half of the AGN in the GOODS fields have been detected in X-rays with Chandra 1--2 Msec exposures. The remaining obscured/low-luminosity AGN are predicted to appear as luminous infrared sources and as normal early-type galaxies in the optical, which will be identified as AGN using the Spitzer observations of the GOODS fields and with surveys at higher energies (10-100 keV). <P />Based on observations obtained with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc, under NASA contract NAS5-26555. This work was supported by NASA grants HST-GO-09425(.01-A,.13-A,.26-A); NSF CAREER award AST 99-83783; NASA contract number 1224666 issued by JPL/Caltech under NASA contract 1407; ASI grant I/R/088/02; and a Royal Society University Research Fellowship., Black hole mass, along with mass accretion rate, is a fundamental property of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We investigate black hole mass and its correlations with other AGN properties for a large sample of ∼ 450 AGNs. For a subsample of ∼ 30 AGNs at z&lt;0.5, we measured the stellar velocity dispersion, estimated black hole mass, and studied the evolution of host galaxies. In contrast to other studies, we find no significant correlation of black hole mass with AGN luminosity or radio loudness. There is a range in Eddington ratio of up to 3 orders of magnitude for any given black hole mass, and the black hole mass of radio-loud and radio-quiet AGNs span the same large range, 10<SUP>6}-10<SUP>{10</SUP></SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, suggesting radio loudness in AGNs does not depend strongly on black hole mass. BL Lac hosts and radio galaxies seem to lie on the same Fundamental Plane as normal galaxies. The M/L evolution of host galaxies is similar to that of normal galaxies. The normality of AGN host galaxies indicates that AGNs are a transient phase in the evolution of most or all galaxies., We present infrared through X-ray spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the 198 hard X-ray selected, z-band identified, active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the GOODS multiwavelength survey. These SEDs include photometry from Spitzer/IRAC observations. Fits to the optical/IR SEDs with local empirical SED templates of both normal and active galaxies identify 36 Type 1 AGN, 89 Type 2 AGN, 64 early-type galaxies and 9 late-type spiral galaxies. Because the majority of the ``early-type galaxies'' are strong X-ray sources with high X-ray hardness ratios and strong infrared emission, they likely harbor fully obscured nuclear activity. Assuming a 15% contamination factor of starbursts in the Type 2 classification, the ratio of obscured to unobscured AGN in our sample is ∼ 3.7:1 for the full redshift range of 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 3.7, and ∼ 4.1:1 for 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2, which contains 62% of the sample and is relatively complete. We observe a decline in this ratio at z &gt; 2, but these values are suspect due to low number statistics and reliance on photometric redshifts due to the R &lt; 24 spectroscopic cutoff. <P />We compare N<SUB>H</SUB> column densities as obtained from model SED fits with predicted distributions (Treister et al. 2004), as well as comparing optical morphology classifications to the observed SEDs. Color-color diagrams of IRAC bands and bolometric luminosity estimates demonstrate the utility of using Spitzer to identify high redshift, moderate luminosity, highly-obscured AGN. Due to the breadth of wavelength coverage, the depth of the images, and precision of source positions, the present sample constitiues one of the largest, least-biased AGN samples to date, representative of the true AGN population., The Rosette Molecular Cloud is an active region of star formation in the Milky Way. We present a study of the cloud using a large scale <SUP>12</SUP>CO and <SUP>13</SUP>CO map of the cloud obtained at the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory. The map covers 6 square degrees at a resolution of 50'' (0.3 pc). Using a clump deconvolution algorithm, we divided the cloud into discrete regions of emission and calculated their physical properties including mass, size, linewidth, temperature, aspect ratio and degree of virialization. Clumps with embedded IRAS sources tend to be hotter and somewhat denser than average. The HII region at the cloud's edge produces a pronounced temperature gradient in the cloud (temperature decreasing as the inverse square root of distance) but does not significantly affect other clump properties. We also smoothed the data set to lower resolutions to study the dependence of the derived clump properties on size scale. The cloud structure was found to be self-similar but clump densities and their virialization parameter decreased with smoothing scale. <P />This research was funded by the National Science Foundation's Research Experiences for Undergraduates program., The Apennines mountains in Italy are associated with subduction by many researchers, motivated by uplift beside thick accretions of sediments in the Po River valley and the Adriatic Sea; deep earthquakes and volcanism in southern Italy, and a long tabular high-wavespeed feature that is observed in mantle tomography from the base of the Apennines to the transition zone. The objective of the RETREAT seismic array is to resolve the pattern of mantle flow associated with the inferred rollback of the Adriatic slab. Because both sides of the active orogen are continental, the Apennines differ from typical oceanic subduction zones. The descent of lithosphere has not, in the historical record, been accompanied by great thrust earthquakes. GPS estimates of convergence are small, no more than a few mm/year. It is not known how much of the crust of the downgoing plate descends with the mantle lithosphere, and how much accretes to the upper crust of the overriding plate. Our seismic results will allow us to resolve the Moho beneath the Apennines and the transition into the actively flowing asthenospheric mantle. Many researchers have argued that subduction of the Adriatic slab has induced a corner flow in the asthenosphere above the slab. Geodynamic modelling suggests that a complex double-cell corner flow is necessary to generate the observed extension of the overriding plate. RETREAT includes broadband seismometers in both 2-D- and linear-arrays that straddle the Apennines and its mantle high-velocity features. In several subduction zones (Kamchatka, Cascadia, Alaska) receiver functions detect P-to-S converted waves from both top and bottom of the subducted oceanic crust. Anisotropy near the top of the slab enhances the P-to-S conversion and suggests the presence of hydrous minerals. If subduction of the full lithosphere is occurring beneath Italy, we expect to observe P-to-S converted phases, with an anisotropic signature, from crust within the subducted lithosphere. Weak or absent P-to-S slab conversions will favor a scenario in which the upper crust does not subduct. The latter scenario would bolster the Rudnick model for continental composition, i.e., that detached lower crust recycles back into the mantle., Through the tools and technology made available via the Virtual Observatory, we have explored the multiwavelength properties, survey coverage, and environments of a sample of 71 steep (-1.0 &lt; α &lt; 0.5) spectrum radio sources taken from the Texas Interferometer Radio catalog (Douglas et al. 1996). Through the VLA proposal by Lucas &amp; Chambers (1989), these radio sources were observed with the A-array configuration at 20 cm and 1485 MHz and with 1 full Schmidt SRC-J, high-latitude sky survey plate ( ∼ 6 sq deg) down to J ∼ 22 with the purpose of finding optical counterparts of mid-to-high z galaxy clusters. With the knowledge that this field had been imaged via the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR2, r=22.2), we submitted the coordinates of the Lucas &amp; Chambers survey sources to the VO image access protocol (SIAP) to quickly and efficiently explore the SDSS ugriz 5-band color images of these sources, specifically looking for u-band drop-outs. Additionally, we used this same technique to explore the multiwavelength coverage of this field with all surveys registered with the VO (2MASS, ROSAT, VLA FIRST/NVSS, Chandra, XMM) via ∼ 1 arcminute snapshots. This revealed a multitude of interesting objects, such as double-lobed radio galaxies with bent jets, implying intercluster medium interactions, extremely faint optical sources with point source 2MASS/J-band detections, and the re-discovery of 3C 273. <P />Finally, as a proof of concept, we utilized the VO tool Topcat to cross-correlate the radio and X-ray positions of known galaxy clusters via the RBSC-NVSS Sample (Bauer et al. 2000) and ROSAT Brightest Cluster Sample (Ebeling et al. 1998), resulting in 17 clusters matched at &lt; 15 arcsec separation. These results demonstrate the simple, yet highly effective utility of the Virtual Observatory on a sample data set to reveal scientifically interesting objects on a short timescale. <P />We would like to acknowledge the National Virtual Observatory Summer School for supplying the opportunity and technical expertise in making this project possible, as well as the support of the National Science Foundation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration., Using the latest Chandra and XMM survey results, we estimate the uncertainties left in models for the X-ray background, in particular in the fraction of highly obscured AGN. We discuss how an EXIST-type mission will remove these ambiguities., Two-dimensional morphological analysis of large samples of galaxies can give us a great deal of information about the way galaxies form and evolve. In order to understand the results, however, we must understand the strengths and limitations of our analysis procedures. We have performed extensive simulations to test the robustness of the two-dimensional fitting algorithm GALFIT on the GOODS-ACS data. We simulate more than 3,000 galaxies, both inactive ""normal"" galaxies and AGN host galaxies. The range of galaxy parameters occupied by our simulations includes galaxies with light profiles that are pure exponential disk and pure deVaucouleur bulge, as well as multi-component galaxies that have a wide range of bulge-to-disk ratios. The AGN host galaxies include central point sources with a large range of contrast ratios compared to the extended host galaxies. We have tested the ability of GALFIT to recover the simulated parameters of these galaxies at redshifts out to z = 1.5. The results of these simulations enable us to better understand and constrain the results of our fitting of real galaxies in the GOODS fields. <P />This work is supported by NASA., The Small and Moderate Aperture Research Telescope System (SMARTS) consortium currently operates four 1m-class telescopes at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory (CTIO) in Chile. Consortium members contribute money, effort, and instrumentation, including most of the operating expenses of the facility - the community retains at least 25% of the time, allocated through NOAO. This special session presents the range of scientific activities being conducted at SMARTS. This talk will set the scene by briefly introducing the facilities involved, the operational philosophy of the consortium, and our plans for the future., We measured the stellar velocity dispersions of 15 active galactic nucleus (AGN) host galaxies at redshifts as high as ~0.34. Combining these with published velocity dispersion measurements from the literature, we study the fundamental plane of AGN host galaxies and its evolution. BL Lac object hosts and radio galaxies seem to lie on the same fundamental plane as normal early-type galaxies. The evolution of the mass-to-light ratio of AGN host galaxies shows a similar trend to that observed in normal early-type galaxies, consistent with single-burst passive evolution models with formation redshifts z&gt;~1. The lack of a significant difference between normal and AGN host galaxies in the fundamental plane supports the ``grand unification'' picture wherein AGNs are a transient phase in the evolution of normal galaxies. The black hole masses of BL Lac objects and radio galaxies, derived using the mass dispersion relation, are similar. The black hole mass is independent of BL Lac object type. The local black hole mass-host galaxy luminosity relation of our subsample at z&lt;0.1 is similar to that of local normal and radio galaxies, but is less well defined at higher redshift owing to the luminosity evolution of the host galaxies., We present evidence that solar structure changes with changes in solar activity. We find that the adiabatic index, Γ<SUB>1</SUB>, changes near the second helium ionization, i.e., at a depth of about 0.98 R<SUB>solar</SUB>. We believe that this change is a result of the change in the effective equation of state caused by magnetic fields. Inversions should be able to detect the changes in Γ<SUB>1</SUB> if mode sets with reliable and precise high-degree modes are available., It is widely recognized that cold dark matter (CDM) models predict abundant dark matter substructure in halos of all sizes. Galaxy-galaxy lensing provides a unique opportunity to directly measure the presence and the mass of such substructures in clusters of galaxies. Here we present the mass function of substructures obtained from lensing in massive Hubble Space Telescope cluster lenses and compare it with that obtained from high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations. We find excellent agreement in the slope and amplitude in the mass range 10<SUP>11</SUP>-10<SUP>12.5</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> probed by the observations, highlighting a significant success of the CDM theory. At lower mass scales, the simulations predict a large abundance of small substructures below our detection threshold with galaxy-galaxy lensing, with many of them being plausibly associated with faint cluster galaxies. Our results suggest that the CDM substructure abundance on the scale of clusters is in good agreement with present observational data., We describe the MUSYC (Multiwavelength Survey by Yale-Chile) project, a 1-square-degree optical-infrared survey to AB limiting depths of U,B,V,R=26.5 and K=22 (K=23.5 in the central 10'x10' region of each field), with extensive follow-up spectroscopy. The project comprises four fields of 30'x30' each, two equatorial and two in the South, chosen for low background and to leverage existing ground- and space-based multiwavelength data, including HST, Chandra, XMM, and mid-infrared (Spitzer). Ground-based imaging has been completed and deep follow-up spectroscopy (up to R ∼ 25) with VLT+VIMOS, Magellan+IMACS and Gemini+GNIRS (up to K ∼ 20) is currently underway. The survey fields will be a natural choice for future observations with ALMA. <P />The broad science goals of this survey range from studies of Brown and White dwarfs in the halo of the Milky Way using proper motions, to a census of accreting supermassive black holes at 0&lt;z&lt;7 using a combination of multi-color selection techniques and X-ray observations, and the study of color-selected Lyman-alpha emitters, Lyman break galaxies, and quasars at redshift ∼ 3. The very deep near-IR coverage in our fields is ideal for studying evolved galaxies and obscured AGN at 1&lt;z&lt;4 through J-K selection criteria. <P />We gratefully acknowledge support from Fundacion Andes, FONDAP Center of Astrophysics, Sigma Xi, and the Yale Perspectives in Science program. This project is supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. AST-0201667., We present an initial look at the far-infrared (FIR) to radio correlation within the spiral disks of M51 and NGC 7331 using Spitzer and radio (18 &amp; 22cm) continuum data taken for the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS) Legacy science team. To measure the scatter within the disks over the large wavelength range of Spitzer, various types of q<SUB>λ </SUB>≡ F<SUB>λ }/F<SUB>{radio</SUB></SUB> maps were made for IR fluxes F<SUB>λ </SUB> = F<SUB>TIR</SUB>, F<SUB>FIR</SUB>, F<SUB>160},F<SUB>{70</SUB></SUB> and F<SUB>24</SUB>. To quantify the variations about the disk of the galaxies, we compare aperture photometry for nuclear, arm, inter-arm, disk, inner-disk, outer-disk, and ring environments from the registered and PSF matched images over various projected, physical apertures. We attempt to explain the IR/radio maps in the context of models for the propagation of cosmic ray electrons, the emission from very small and large grains, and quiescent and active star formation. We also compare our matched aperture results to global measurements for star-forming galaxies assembled from the literature. <P />E. J.

The <SUP>187</SUP>Os/ <SUP>188</SUP>Os value of sediment leaches varies as a function of climate, consistent with a more radiogenic Os signal during interglacial times and less radiogenic Os values more typical of glacial times. The signal is confounded by contributions from a high Os detrital component with a variable <SUP>187</SUP>Os/ <SUP>188</SUP>Os value, but generally agrees with prior result from deposits from other marine environments., The Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) is a multiwavelength study, ranging from hard X-rays to the mid-infrared, designed in part to find obscured AGN in the early Universe, particularly at the ``quasar epoch,"" at z ∼ 2. The unprecedented area and depth of GOODS, with its 4-band HST ACS imaging, megasecond Chandra pointings, and Spitzer IRAC and MIPS observations, provides a unique probe of faint, reddened AGN at high redshift. We show that extending the local ratio of roughly 3 times as many obscured AGN as unobscured to higher redshift fits very well the optical, infrared, and X-ray source counts in the GOODS fields, with essentially no free parameters (once the unification geometry is set). This model also reproduces the spectrum and intensity of the X-ray background. Some reported ``evolution"" in the ratio of obscured to unobscured AGN --- for example with luminosity, redshift, or flux --- can be explained easily by selection bias against the fainter obscured AGN. Based on observations obtained with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc, under NASA contract NAS5-26555. This work was supported in part by NASA grant HST-GO-09425.13-A., The ultimate source of the magnetic fields that drive the Sun-Weather is located in the solar interior, where the dynamo mechanism (or mechanisms) operate. To model these processes, it is necessary to combine the tools of plasma physics (MHD) together with those of stellar structure and evolution, and large eddy simulations (LES) of the convective envelope. Because of the differences in methodologies and space and time scales, it has not been possible, until now, to produce models that incorporate all aspects of the problem. However, the modeling of each separate component has been progressing with ever increasing sophistication, and the first attempts are being made to combine several approaches at once. This presentation will describe where these efforts are at the present time, what the next steps are likely to be, and what should ultimately be done in order to produce a dynamo model capable of explaining (and forecasting) the most significant aspects of Sun-Weather., Since 1998 we have monitored approximately 10 low-mass X-ray binaries (most being black-hole candidates) at optical and infrared (OIR) wavelengths on a near-daily basis. Our data has been obtained using the ANDICAM camera, first on the CTIO 1.0m telescope under the YALO consortium, and more recently (since 2003) on the CTIO 1.3m telescope under the SMARTS consortium. We have accumulated a dataset that provides unprecedented sampling in the OIR during the various outburst states of these objects. Upon combining our results with those at other wavelengths, we are able to shed more light on the physical conditions present in the X-ray binary during the different outburst states. This talk will focus on our OIR light curves and the information we have gathered from them, in particular on the possible contribution of jet synchrotron radiation to the OIR. <P />This research has been made possible by the support from the National Science Foundation through grant AST 00-98421., Convective core overshoot affects stellar evolution rates and the dating of stellar populations. In this paper, we provide a patch to the Y<SUP>2</SUP> isochrones with an improved treatment of convective core overshoot. The new tracks cover the transition mass range from no convective core to a fully developed convective core. We compare the improved isochrones to CMDs of a few well-observed open star clusters in the Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud. Finally, we discuss future prospects for improving the treatment of core overshoot with the help of asteroseismology., We obtained simultaneous optical and near-infrared observations of 4U 1543-47 during its 2002 outburst. The most striking feature of the outburst light curve is the secondary maximum, which appears after the object transitions into the low-hard state. This secondary maximum is much stronger in the infrared bands than in the optical. We suggest that the origin of the secondary maximum flux may be synchrotron radiation associated with a jet. Close infrared monitoring may lead to reliable triggers for simultaneous multiwavelength campaigns to study jet formation processes., We are monitoring the B-, V-, and I-band light curves of Centaurs and trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) to determine the wavelength dependence of their solar phase curves. Since February 2003 we have used the SMARTS 1.3m telescope at Cerro Tololo to make 1800 photometric measurements of 15 bodies. The observations span the observable phase-angle range of each target and average 34 nights per target. Our preliminary analysis show that the phase curves are nearly all linear, but with slopes varying from 0.048 to 0.287 mag/deg depending on the target. Most of these phase curves also show no significant wavelength dependence, with the notable exception of a few that steepen with increasing wavelength. This wavelength dependence occurs only for the reddest targets in our sample with V-I &gt; 1.1 mag. Two of these are (50000) Quaoar and 2002 AW197, large bodies known to have modest albedos ( 0.1). Our results may indicate that both coherent backscatter and shadow hiding influence the phase brightening of such TNOs. Since the influence of coherent backscatter increases with surface reflectance, the wavelength dependence of the phase curves for the bodies with very red colors would result from an increase in the magnitude of the coherent backscatter at longer wavelengths relative to the contribution from shadow hiding., The deep X-ray, optical, and far-infrared fields that constitute the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) are sensitive to obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs; N<SUB>H</SUB>&gt;~10<SUP>22</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) at the quasar epoch (z~2-3), as well as to unobscured AGNs as distant as z~7. Luminous X-ray emission is a sign of accretion onto a supermassive black hole and thus reveals all but the most heavily obscured AGNs. We combine X-ray luminosity functions with appropriate spectral energy distributions for AGNs to model the X-ray, optical, and far-infrared flux distributions of the X-ray sources in the GOODS fields. A simple model based on the unified paradigm for AGNs, with ~3 times as many obscured AGNs as unobscured, successfully reproduces the z-band flux distributions measured in the deep Hubble Space Telescope ACS observations of the GOODS-North and GOODS-South fields. This model is also consistent with the observed spectroscopic and photometric redshift distributions once selection effects are considered. The previously reported discrepancy between observed spectroscopic redshift distributions and the predictions of population synthesis models for the X-ray background can be explained by a bias against the most heavily obscured AGNs generated by both X-ray observations and the identification of sources via optical spectroscopy. We predict the AGN number counts for Spitzer MIPS 24 μm and IRAC 3.6-8 μm observations in the GOODS fields, which will verify whether most AGNs in the early universe are obscured in the optical. Such AGNs should be very bright far-infrared sources and include some obscured AGNs missed even by X-ray observations., We combine X-ray luminosity functions with appropiate spectral energy distributions (SED) to model the X-ray and optical flux distributions of the X-ray sources in the GOODS fields. A simple model based on the unified paradigm for AGN successfully reproduces the X-ray and optical number counts and is consistent with the observed spectroscopic and photometric redshift distributions. A significant population of obscured AGN are missing in the X-ray samples, but should be visible in deep far infrared observations., We present predictions of AGN number counts for the upcoming Spitzer MIPS 24 μm and IRAC 3.6-8 μm observations in the GOODS fields. Our model predicts that AGN will be bright far-infrared sources and will be easily detected in the Spitzer GOODS fields. The observed sample will probe whether large numbers of obscured sources are present in the early Universe., A new influx of sea-rafted pumice reached the eastern coast of Australia in October 2002, approximately 1 year after a felsic, shallow-marine explosive eruption at a previously unknown volcano (0403-091) along the Tofua volcanic arc (Tonga). The eruption produced floating pumice rafts that first became stranded in Fiji in November 2001, approximately 1 month after the eruption. Strandings of sea-rafted pumice along shorelines have been the only record of products from this submarine explosive eruption at the remote, submerged volcano. Computed drift trajectories of the sea-rafted pumice using numerical models of southwest Pacific surface wind fields and ocean currents indicate two cyclonic systems disturbed the drift of pumice to eastern Australia, as well as the importance of the combined wave and direct wind effect on pumice trajectory. Pumice became stranded along at least two-thirds (&gt;2000 km) of the coastline of eastern Australia being deposited on beaches during a sustained period of fresh onshore winds. Typical amounts of pumice initially stranded on beaches were 500-4000 individual clasts per m <SUP>2</SUP>, and a minimum volume estimate of pumice that arrived to eastern Australia is 1.25×10 <SUP>5</SUP> m <SUP>3</SUP>. Pumice was beached below maximum tidal/storm surge levels and was quickly reworked back into the ocean, such that the concentration of beached pumice rapidly dissipated within weeks of the initial stranding, and little record of this stranding event now exists. Most stranded pumice clasts ranged in size from 2 to 5 cm in diameter; the largest measured clasts were 10 cm in Australia and 20 cm in Fiji. The pumice has a low phenocryst content (&lt;5% modal), containing the assemblage of calcic plagioclase (An <SUB>88-74</SUB>), augite (En <SUB>35</SUB>Fs <SUB>29</SUB>Wo <SUB>36</SUB>), pigeonite (En <SUB>45</SUB>Fs <SUB>46</SUB>Wo <SUB>9</SUB>), and titanomagnetite. Examined pumice clasts are compositionally homogenous, although there is considerable variation in clast vesicularity, both within and between clasts. The pumice composition is low-K dacite (65-68 wt.% SiO <SUB>2</SUB>) and similar to other pumice-forming eruptions from the Tonga region. Most clasts stranded along eastern Australia were fouled by a variety of organisms, whereas pumice stranded on beaches in Fiji ∼1 month after the eruption was free of binding organisms. The dominant rafted organisms in order of abundance were algae, goose barnacles ( Lepas sp.), serpulid worms, calcareous algae, bryozoans, corals ( Pocillopora sp., Porites sp., Cyphastrea sp.), oysters ( Saccostrea sp.), and gastropods ( Janthina sp.). The size of some rafted corals implied growth of at least 12 months in viable water. The abundance and variety of fouling taxa, coupled with the long dispersal trajectory (&gt;3500 km) and period of pumice floatation (≥1 year), confirm the importance of sea-rafted pumice as a long-distance dispersal mechanism for marine organisms including marine pests and harmful invasive species. Billions of individual rafting pumice clasts can be generated in a single small-volume eruption, such as observed here, and the geological implications for the transport of sessile taxa over large distances are significant. An avenue for future research is to examine whether speciation events and volcanicity are linked; the periodic development of globalism for some taxa (e.g., corals, gastropods, bryozoa) may correlate in time and/or space with voluminous silicic igneous events capable of producing &gt;10 <SUP>6</SUP> km <SUP>3</SUP> of silicic pumice-rich pyroclastic material and emplaced into ocean basins., CAIRNS (Cluster and Infall Region Nearby Survey) is a spectroscopic survey of the infall regions surrounding nine nearby rich clusters of galaxies. In our previous paper, we used redshifts within ~10 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc of the centers of the clusters to determine the mass profiles of the clusters based on the phase-space distribution of the galaxies. Here, we use Two Micron All Sky Survey photometry and an additional 515 redshifts to investigate the environmental dependence of near-infrared mass-to-light ratios. In the virial regions, the halo occupation function is nonlinear; the number of bright galaxies per halo increases more slowly than the mass of the halo. On larger scales, the light contained in galaxies is less clustered than the mass in rich clusters. Specifically, the mass-to-light ratio inside the virial radius is a factor of 1.8+/-0.3 larger than that outside the virial radius. This difference could result from changing fractions of baryonic to total matter or from variations in the efficiency of galaxy formation or disruption with environment. The average mass-to-light ratio M/L<SUB>K</SUB>=53+/-5h implies Ω<SUB>m</SUB>=0.18+/-0.03 (statistical) using the luminosity density based on Two Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey data. These results are difficult to reconcile with independent methods that suggest higher Ω<SUB>m</SUB>. Reconciling these values by invoking bias requires that the typical value of M/L<SUB>K</SUB> changes significantly at densities of &lt;~3ρ<SUB>c</SUB>., Very deep near-infrared observations in the Faint InfraRed Extragalactic Survey (FIRES) have recently uncovered a significant population of red galaxies at redshifts z&gt;2. These distant red galaxies (DRGs) are efficiently selected by the criterion J<SUB>s</SUB>-K<SUB>s</SUB>&gt;2.3. We use Chandra data to examine the X-ray emission from DRGs in the 5<SUP>'</SUP>×5<SUP>'</SUP> FIRES MS 1054-03 field. Two of 40 DRGs with K<SUB>s</SUB>&lt;22 are detected by Chandra, and we infer that 5<SUP>+3</SUP><SUB>-2</SUB>% of DRGs host active nuclei with L<SUB>X</SUB>&gt;1.2×10<SUP>43</SUP> ergs s<SUP>-1</SUP>. This fraction is smaller than that inferred from optical and near-IR spectroscopy, probably largely owing to strong spectroscopic selection biases. By stacking all undetected DRGs, we find that their average X-ray flux in the 0.5-8 keV band is ~4.6×10<SUP>-17</SUP> ergs s<SUP>-1</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. The detection is only significant in the soft (0.5-2 keV; 3.4 σ) and full (0.5-8 keV; 3.2 σ) energy bands. The mean detection may result from star formation, the presence of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs), or a combination of both. Assuming the detection is due exclusively to star formation, we find an average instantaneous star formation rate of 214+/-68(random)+/-73(systematic) M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, in excellent agreement with previous results from spectral energy distribution fitting when constant star formation histories are assumed. These results may imply that DRGs contribute significantly to the cosmic star formation rate at z~2.5. However, the mean X-ray flux strictly provides only an upper limit to the star formation rate owing to the uncertain contribution of low-luminosity, possibly obscured AGNs. Observations at other wavelengths are needed to provide independent estimates of the star formation rate of DRGs., We have measured the absolute proper motion of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy from a combination of photographic plate material and Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 data that provide a time baseline of up to 50 yr. The extragalactic reference frame consists of eight QSO images and 48 galaxies. The absolute proper motion is μ<SUB>α</SUB>cosδ=0.59+/-0.16 mas yr<SUP>-1</SUP> and μ<SUB>δ</SUB>=-0.15+/-0.16 mas yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The corresponding orbit of Fornax is polar, with an eccentricity of 0.27 and a radial period of 4.5 Gyr. Fornax's current location is near pericenter. The direction of the motion of Fornax supports the notion that Fornax belongs to the Fornax-Leo I-Leo II-Sculptor-Sextans stream as hypothesized by both Lynden-Bell and Majewski. According to our orbit determination, Fornax crossed the Magellanic plane ~190 Myr ago, a time that coincides with the termination of the star formation process in Fornax. We propose that ram pressure stripping due to the passage of Fornax through a gaseous medium denser than the typical intragalactic medium left behind from the LMC may have caused the end of star formation in Fornax. The excess, anomalous clouds within the south Galactic pole region of the Magellanic Stream, whose origin has long been debated in the literature as constituents of either the Magellanic Stream or of the extragalactic Sculptor group, are found to lie along the orbit of Fornax. We speculate that these clouds are stripped material from Fornax as the dwarf crossed the orbit of the Magellanic Clouds., We present the results of deep optical imaging and spectroscopy of archival Chandra sources with intermediate fluxes (&gt;1e-15 erg/cm2/sec). 267 Chandra sources were detected in 5 archival fields, with 106 spectroscopic IDs obtained using Magellan and the VLT. The survey is designed to fill the gap between deep, narrow surveys like CDF-N/S and broad, shallow surveys like CHAMP. We discuss the fraction of obscured sources, their redshift distribution, and their overall optical properties. Two high redshift, x-ray selected AGN with z&gt; 4 were found., A program of follow-up observations of HIPPARCOS Double Stars has been started using the WIYN 3.5-m Telescope at Kitt Peak, Arizona. Observations are made with the recently-completed RYTSI speckle camera, which is capable of determining reliable magnitude differences at various wavelengths down to the diffraction limit of the telescope. Thus in addition to precise relative astrometry, component magnitudes and colors can be obtained in a survey mode for all systems observed. Preliminary results and system capabilities are described. The benefits of a sustained program of observations of the HIPPARCOS Double Stars include populating the mass-luminosity relation with many more points (once the orbital status of these stars is known and orbital parameters are determined in sufficient detail for gravitationally bound pairs), robust tests of stellar evolution calculations in cases where at least one component has evolved off the main sequence, and a more complete picture of the nearby field binary population., We recently identified a substantial population of galaxies at z&gt;2 with comparatively red rest-frame optical colors. These distant red galaxies (DRGs) are efficiently selected by the simple observed color criterion J<SUB>s</SUB>-K<SUB>s</SUB>&gt;2.3. In this paper we present near-infrared spectroscopy with Keck NIRSPEC of six DRGs with previously measured redshifts 2.4&lt;z&lt;3.2, two of which were known to host an active nucleus. We detect continuum emission and emission lines of all observed galaxies. Equivalent widths of Hα in the nonactive galaxies are 20-30 Å, smaller than measured for Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and nearby luminous infrared galaxies and comparable to normal nearby galaxies. The modest equivalent widths imply that the galaxies either have a decreasing star formation rate or are very dusty. Fitting both the photometry and the Hα lines, we find continuum extinction A<SUB>V</SUB>=1-2 mag, ages 1-2.5 Gyr, star formation rates 200-400 M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, and stellar masses (1-5)×10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> for models with constant star formation rates. Models with a declining star formation lead to significantly lower extinction, star formation rates, and ages but similar stellar masses. From [N II]/Hα ratios we infer that the metallicities are high, 1-1.5 times solar. For four galaxies we can determine line widths from the optical emission lines. The widths are high, ranging from 130 to 240 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, and by combining data for LBGs and DRGs, we find significant correlations between line width and rest-frame U-V color and between line width and stellar mass. The latter correlation has a similar slope and offset as the ``baryonic Tully-Fisher relation'' for nearby galaxies. From the line widths and effective radii we infer dynamical masses and mass-to-light (M/L) ratios. The median dynamical mass is ~2×10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>, supporting the high stellar masses inferred from the photometry. We find that the median M/L<SUB>V</SUB>~0.8(M/L)<SUB>solar</SUB>, a factor of ~5 higher than measured for LBGs. We infer from our small sample that DRGs are dustier, more metal-rich, and more massive and have higher ages than z~3 LBGs of the same rest-frame V-band luminosity. Although their volume density is still uncertain, their high M/L ratios imply that they contribute significantly to the stellar mass density at z~2.5. As their stellar masses are comparable to those of early-type galaxies, they may have already assembled most of their final mass. <P />Based on observations obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated jointly by the California Institute of Technology and the University of California, and on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Paranal, Chile (ESO LP 164.O-0612)., , We measure differences in structure between active and quiet regions of the Sun using the frequencies of high-degree modes determined from ring-diagram analyses. We find that both the speed of sound and the adiabatic index Γ<SUB>1</SUB> differ in active regions as compared with quiet regions. In the immediate subsurface layers, the sound speed is lower in active regions, but below a depth of about 7 Mm the opposite is true. A comparison of sound-speed inversion results with those for Γ<SUB>1</SUB> indicates that at least a part of the differences between active and quiet regions is likely to be due to the structural and thermal perturbations caused by magnetic fields in the active region., HST observations of globular cluster cores have resulted in many radial-velocity and proper-motion data sets, with the potential for many more. These have led to various claims for the existence of intermediate-mass black holes in some globular clusters. The theoretical underpinning of these claims is very weak, however. We propose to produce new models of globular cluster cores, both with and without black holes, in order to redress this lack and allow us to make the most effective use of the HST data., We report simultaneous optical and X-ray observations of the black hole X-ray binary system V4641 Sgr during early August 2003 when the source was in a state of violent, rapid outburst., We have taken optical and infrared observations during the 2002 outburst of the soft X-ray transient, 4U 1543-47. A secondary maximum occurs in the lightcurves during the outburst decline. This feature is much stronger at infrared wavelengths than optical. We have applied single blackbody, multicolor blackbody and broken-power law models to the optical/infrared spectral energy distribution of the secondary maximum and find that the broken power-law provides the best fit. We therefore conclude that the secondary maximum emission originates from a jet. We also show the most recent lightcurves of the 2002/2003 outburst of GX 339-4 in which a secondary maximum appears. This leads us to the conclusion that secondary maxima may be a common occurrence in soft X-ray transients during outburst decline which appear after the object transitions into the low-hard state. Infrared observations of such phenomena will give reliable triggers for multiwavelength observations, allowing us to greatly improve our knowledge of jet formation and behavior, and how this relates to the accretion geometry., Temporal gaps in the stratigraphic record have important implications for the interpretation of stratigraphically rapid geochemical and paleobiologic changes, for the development of high-resolution time scales (e.g., orbital time scales), and for deciphering the response of depositional systems to climatic change and basin evolution (e.g., accommodation space vs. sediment supply). In ancient pelagic and hemipelagic strata, the identification of relatively short hiatus (10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>6</SUP> years) is commonly challenged by the resolution limits of geochronologic techniques. In this study, a quantitative method is developed to identify and quantify hiatuses in strata where Milankovitch orbital cycles are documented. The new method is based on the interpretation of evolutive harmonic analysis (EHA) results and permits estimation of minimum durations for the temporal gaps. Application of this technique to an optical densitometry data series derived from the Cenomanian/Turonian (C/T) Bridge Creek Limestone Member permits quantification of hiatus within the unit and addresses important questions about abrupt changes in biogeochemical proxy records across the boundary interval. Integration of the new method with stratigraphic data and geochemical burial flux estimates permits a detailed reconstruction of the controls on sediment delivery and hiatus generation, including a refined analysis of the orbital-scale linkages between climate and sedimentation., I review the main theoretical conclusions from high-energy spectral observations of Galactic Black Hole Candidate systems. With an eye towards future missions, I show how the ability to reach such conclusions depends critically on the type of spectral coverage one has available. Perhaps the most important factor in determining how well a set of observations constrains theoretical models is the range of energies that can be observed in a simultaneous manner, the wider the better. High spectral resolution observations over a narrow energy band, e.g., as provided by Chandra and eventually ASTRO E-2, are potentially extremely interesting but not as useful as one might first think without an understanding of the underlying broad-band continuum. A snapshot, time-integrated spectrum that has very wide energy coverage, however, is still not sufficient to break all the current model degeneracies. The tightest model constraints instead come from combining spectral with timing information. The RXTE satellite excelled in this regard, enabling unprecedented spectral variability studies on both short and long timescales by virtue of its large collection area, broad energy response, and flexible scheduling. Future instruments, or combinations of instruments, must strive for a similar balance of timing and broad-band spectral capabilities if they are to prove as effective as RXTE., NGC 6752 is one of the best-studied dense globular clusters, and a wide variety of intriguing and anomalous results have been obtained. We propose ACS imaging of the core of this cluster. This will increase the accuracy of our previous internal proper motion measurements by almost an order of magnitude, providing an unprecedented probe of the central potential. The data will also greatly increase the radial extent of previous work on the binary frequency and luminosity function of this cluster. Together, the data will provide a new level of constraints on the dynamics of a dense globular cluster., The detection of gravitational lensing of distant galaxies by foreground galaxies has been used in recent years to set constraints on the masses and sizes of the galaxy halos. The same technique has been successfully applied to galaxies in the dense environments of massive X-ray clusters. These studies point to a smaller spatial extent for the dark matter halos of cluster galaxies compared to equivalent luminosity field galaxies due to tidal truncation inside a cluster . The size distribution of these tidally truncated radii can be used to probe the nature of dark matter composing these halos by making assumptions about the dynamics and detailed shape of the gravitational potential of the cluster. The use of simplifying theoretical assumptions have enabled placing conservative upper limits on the cross-section for fluid-like dark matter {FDM}. The goal of this project is to develop a more robust theoretical framework utilizing cluster models derived from cosmological N-body simulations that will provide stronger constraints on the nature and interaction cross-section of dark matter. This technique when bolstered with numerical models of clusters offers a unique and complementary way to constrain the equation of state of DM, and constrain the parameter space of viable candidates., Using deep VLT/ISAAC near-infrared imaging data, we derive the K<SUB>s</SUB>-band luminosity function (LF) of the z=1.237 massive X-ray luminous cluster of galaxies <ASTROBJ>RDCS J1252.9-2927</ASTROBJ>. Photometric redshifts, derived from deep multi-wavelength BVRIzJK<SUB>s</SUB> data, and calibrated using a large subset of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, are used to separate the cluster galaxy population from the foreground and background field galaxy population. This allows for a simultaneous determination of the characteristic magnitude K<SUP>*</SUP><SUB>s</SUB> and faint end slope α of the LF without having to make an uncertain statistical background subtraction. The derived LF is well represented by the Schechter function with K<SUB>s</SUB><SUP>*</SUP>=18.54<SUP>+0.45</SUP><SUB>-0.55</SUB> and α=-0.64<SUP>+0.27</SUP><SUB>-0.25</SUB>. The shape of the bright end of the derived LF is similar to that measured at similar restframe wavelengths (in the z-band) in local clusters, but the characteristic magnitude is brighter by Δ M<SUB>z</SUB><SUP>*</SUP>=-1.40<SUP>+0.49</SUP><SUB>-0.58</SUB> mag. The derived α is similar to the value derived in the K<SUB>s</SUB>-band in the z=1 cluster of galaxies <ASTROBJ>MG2016+112</ASTROBJ> but is shallower (at the 2.2σ level) than the value measured at similar restframe wavelength (in the z-band) in clusters in the local universe. The brightening of the characteristic magnitude and lack of evolution in the shape of the bright end of the LF suggests that the massive cluster ellipticals that dominate the bright end of the LF were already in place at z=1.237, while the flattening of the faint end slope suggest that clusters at z∼ 1 contains relatively smaller fractions of low mass galaxies than clusters in the local universe. <P />The results presented in this paper are a challenge for semi analytical hierarchical models of galaxy formation which predict the characteristic magnitude to grow fainter and the faint end slope to steepen with redshift as the massive galaxies break up into their progenitors. The observed evolution is consistent with a scenario in which clusters are composed of a population of massive galaxies which formed at high redshift (z≫1) and subsequently evolved passively, and a population of lower mass galaxies which are gradually accreted from the field, primarily at lower redshift (z&lt;1). <P />Based on observations obtained at the European Southern Observatory using the ESO Very Large Telescope on Cerro Paranal (ESO program 166.A-0101)., Using high-resolution smoothed particle hydrodynamics numerical simulations, we investigate the effects of gas on the in-spiral and merger of a massive black hole binary. This study is motivated by both observational and theoretical work that indicate the presence of large amounts of gas in the central regions of merging galaxies. N-body simulations have shown that the coalescence of a massive black hole binary eventually stalls in a stellar background. However, our simulations suggest that the massive black hole binary will finally merge if it is embedded in a gaseous background. Here we present results in which the gas is assumed to be initially spherical with a relatively smooth distribution. In the early evolution of the binary, the separation decreases as a result of the gravitational drag exerted by the background gas. In the later stages, when the binary dominates the gravitational potential in its vicinity, the medium responds by forming an ellipsoidal density enhancement whose axis lags behind the binary axis, and this offset produces a torque on the binary that causes continuing loss of angular momentum and is able to reduce the binary separation to distances where gravitational radiation is efficient. Assuming typical parameters from observations of ultraluminous infrared galaxies, we predict that a black hole binary will merge within 10<SUP>7</SUP> yr; therefore, these results imply that in a merger of gas-rich galaxies, any massive central black holes will coalesce soon after the galaxies merge. Our work thus supports scenarios of massive black hole evolution and growth in which hierarchical merging plays an important role. The final coalescence of the black holes leads to gravitational radiation emission that would be detectable out to high redshift by LISA. We show that similar physical effects, which we simulate with higher resolution than in previous work, can also be important for the formation of close binary stars., Optical and infrared monitoring of the afterglow site of gamma-ray burst GRB 031203 has revealed a brightening source embedded in the host galaxy, which we attribute to the presence of a supernova (SN) related to the GRB (``SN 2003lw''). We present details of the discovery and evolution of SN 2003lw from 0.2 to 92 days after the GRB, derived from SMARTS consortium photometry in I and J bands. GRB 031203 was an intrinsically faint GRB, and the optical light curve is dominated by the SN after the first few days. A template Type Ic light curve, constructed from SN 1998bw photometry, is consistent with the peak brightness of SN 2003lw, although the light curves are not identical. Differential astrometry reveals that the SN, and hence the GRB, occurred less than 300 h<SUP>-1</SUP><SUB>71</SUB> pc (3 σ) from the apparent galaxy center., We present the results of detailed analysis of X-ray data in the 3-20 keV range from a ~70 day outburst of the neutron star transient Aquila X-1 during 2000 September-November. Optical monitoring with the Yale 1 m telescope was used to trigger X-ray observations with Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) in order to follow the outburst from a very early stage. In this paper we discuss the correlated evolution in time of features in the spectral and temporal domains for the entire outburst. The state transition from the low/hard state to the high/soft state during the rise of the outburst occurs at higher luminosity than the transition back to the low/hard state during the decay, as has also been observed in other outbursts. Fourier power spectra at low frequencies show a broken power law continuum during the rising phase, with the break frequency increasing with time. During the decline from maximum, the source evolves to a position in the hardness-intensity plane, as well as in the color-color diagram, that is similar to, but distinct from, the canonical high/soft state. High-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations from 636 to 870 Hz were seen only during this transitional state., An anaylsis was done of the maxima of Mira, Chi Cygni, R Leonis, and R Hydrae, four Mira-type variable stars chosen from among those studied by Argelander in 1839. A negative correlation between the luminosity of consecuitve maxima was found, except for R Hya, M(i+1) - M(i) vs. M(i) yields a correlation index of r<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.6 for Mira and Chi Cyg, r<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.44 for R Leo, and r<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.25 for R Hya. Data analyzed range from the discovery of Mira (1596) to the present time; they include AAVSO data, and there are from 90( RHya) to 179 (Mira Ceti) pairs of consecutive maxima., We present VLA H I observations at ~20""~=1.5 kpc resolution of the highly inclined, H I-deficient Virgo Cluster spiral galaxy NGC 4522, which is one of the clearest and nearest cases of ongoing intracluster medium-interstellar medium (ICM-ISM) stripping. H I is abundant and spatially coincident with the stellar disk in the center, but beyond R=3 kpc the H I distribution in the disk is sharply truncated, and the only H I is extraplanar and all on the northwest side. Forty percent of the total H I, corresponding to 1.5×10<SUP>8</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>, is extraplanar and has likely been removed from the galaxy disk by an ICM-ISM interaction. The kinematics and the morphology of the H I appear more consistent with ongoing stripping and less consistent with gas fall-back, which may occur long after peak pressure. Some of the extraplanar gas has line widths (FWZI) of 150 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, including a blueshifted tail of weaker emission, and much of the extraplanar gas exhibits a modest net blueshift with respect to the galaxy's disk rotational velocities, consistent with gas accelerated toward the mean cluster velocity. The southwest side of the galaxy has less H I in the disk but more H I in the halo, suggesting more effective gas removal on the side of the galaxy that is rotating into the ICM wind. In recent simulations of ICM-ISM interactions large surface densities of extraplanar gas like that in NGC 4522 are seen at relatively early stages of active stripping and not during later gas fall-back stages. The galaxy is 3.3d~=800 kpc from M87, somewhat outside the region of strongest cluster X-ray emission. The ram pressure at this location, assuming a static smooth ICM and standard values for ICM density and galaxy velocity, appears inadequate to cause the observed stripping. We consider the possibility that the ram pressure is significantly stronger than standard values, because of large bulk motions and local density enhancements of the ICM gas, which may occur in a dynamic, shock-filled ICM experiencing subcluster merging. The H I and Hα distributions are similar, with both truncated in the disk at the same radius and H II regions located throughout much of the extraplanar H I. This implies that the star-forming molecular ISM has been effectively stripped from the outer disk of the galaxy along with the H I. The inferred peak stripping rate of ~10 M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> is much larger than the galaxy's total star formation rate of ~0.1 M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, implying that the rate of triggered star formation due to ICM pressure is presently minor compared with the rate of gas lost as a result of stripping., We analyse the cosmological consequences of locked inflation, a model recently proposed by Dvali and Kachru that can produce significant amounts of inflation without requiring slow-roll. We pay particular attention to the end of inflation in this model, showing that a secondary phase of saddle inflation can follow the locked inflationary era. However, this subsequent period of inflation results in a strongly scale dependent spectrum that can lead to massive black hole formation in the primordial universe. Avoiding this disastrous outcome puts strong constraints on the parameter space open to models of locked inflation., We model the X-ray, optical, and far-infrared flux distributions of AGN in the GOODS fields, starting from hard X-ray luminosity functions and spectral energy distributions appropriate to the unified scheme for AGN. The deep optical counts measured from HST ACS images can be well explained by a unified scheme that postulates roughly 3 times as many obscured as unobscured AGN. This scenario is consistent with the observed spectroscopic and photometric redshift distributions of the GOODS AGN once selection effects are considered. The previously reported discrepancy between observed spectroscopic redshift distributions and the predictions of population synthesis models for the X-ray background (which include a similarly large number of obscured AGN) is explained by bias against the most heavily obscured AGN in both X-ray surveys and optical spectroscopic samples. We present the model predictions for the number counts of AGN in the Spitzer MIPS 24 micron and IRAC 3.6-8 micron bands. The GOODS Spitzer observations will verify whether large numbers of obscured AGN are indeed present in the early Universe; these will be very bright far-infrared sources, including some, missed by X-ray observations, that look like ultraluminous infrared galaxies. <P />Based on observations obtained with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc, under NASA contract NAS5-26555.

We investigate if solar models constructed with lower oxygen and other heavy element abundances are consistent with helioseismic results. We find that lowered abundances along with the current OPAL opacity tables are not consistent with seismic data. A significant upward revision of the opacity tables is required to make solar models with lower heavy element abundances that are consistent with seismic constraints. <P />This work is supported by a grant from the NSF., A tall, dielectric-lined rectangular wakefield microstructure is analyzed as a possible element of an advanced linear wakefield accelerator. This accelerator would be driven by a train of fs electron microbunches that would be chopped out of a longer bunch using a powerful CO<SUB>2</SUB> laser and then formed into a train of rectangular-profile bunches using a quadrupole. The bunches set up a periodic wakefield in the microstructure that can be built up to 400 600 MV/m, for example, using a train of ten 3-fs 1-pC bunches. Two major issues are examined. First, interference is studied using the particle-in-cell code KARAT between transition radiation and Cerenkov wakefield radiation, both set up by the passage of a charge bunch through a dielectric structure of finite length. Of significance is the difference in propagation speeds of transition radiation and Cerenkov radiation (which travels almost at the vacuum light speed c) and the magnitude of the respective fields. Second, stability is examined for drive and accelerated bunches using computations of test particle orbits in the longitudinal and transverse wakefields excited by the drive bunches. It is found that nearly all test electrons in the drive bunches are confined within the structure for a travel distance of 30cm or more, while test electrons located in an accelerated bunch can have stable motion over greater than 30cm without passing through the structure walls., We measured the stellar velocity dispersions of 15 AGN host galaxies at redshift as high as ∼ 0.34. Combined with previous velocity dispersion measurements from the literature, we study the Fundamental Plane of AGN host galaxies. BL Lac hosts and radio galaxies seem to lie on the same Fundamental Plane as normal early-type galaxies. The evolution of the mass-to-light ratio of AGN host galaxies shows the same trend as normal early-types in the field or in clusters. The lack of a significant difference between normal and AGN host galaxies supports the ``Grand Unification"" picture wherein AGNs are a transient phase in the evolution of normal galaxies., Several observations of a five-quark bound system, pentaquarks, from various experiments in photon-nucleus, kaon-nucleus, and proton-proton reactions have been reported*. The presence of these states was predicted by Diakonov at al. using chiral soliton models of baryons in 1997. ** The high energies and particle densities resulting from collisions at RHIC are expected to favor pentaquark production. The large acceptance of STAR's Time Projection Chamber is ideal for such rare particle searches. The short lifetimes predicted for pentaquarks require that a mixing technique be used to reconstruct the pentaquarks via their decay products. This technique has already been used successfully by STAR to reconstruct and study short-lived resonances. We report on the progress of the pentaquark search by the STAR collaboration in pp, dAu, and AuAu collisions through one of the decay modes, Θ^+arrow p+K^0. *T.Nakano et al.

Petrov and M. Polakov Z.Phys. A359 (1997) 305-314, We report the discovery of two new gravitationally lensed quasars, WFI J2026-4536 and WFI J2033-4723, at respective source redshifts of z=2.23 and z=1.66. Both systems are quadruply imaged and have similar PG 1115-like image configurations. WFI J2026-4536 has a maximum image separation of 1.4"", a total brightness of g=16.5, and a relatively simple lensing environment, while WFI J2033-4723 has a maximum image separation of 2.5"", an estimated total brightness of g~17.9, and a more complicated environment of at least six galaxies within 20"". The primary lensing galaxies are detected for both systems after point-spread function subtraction. Several of the broadband flux ratios in these systems show a strong (0.1-0.4 mag) trend with wavelength, suggesting either microlensing or differential extinction through the lensing galaxy. For WFI J2026-4536, the total quasar flux has dimmed by 0.1 mag in the blue but only half as much in the red over 3 months, suggestive of microlensing-induced variations. For WFI J2033-4723, resolved spectra of some of the quasar components reveal emission-line flux ratios that agree better with the macromodel predictions than either the broadband or continuum ratios, also indicative of microlensing. The predicted differential time delays for WFI J2026-4536 are short, ranging from 1 to 2 weeks for the long delay, but are longer for WFI J2033-4723, ranging from 1 to 2 months. Both systems hold promise for future monitoring campaigns aimed at microlensing or time delay studies. <P />Based on observations obtained with the MPG/ESO 2.2 m telescope, the CTIO 1.5 m telescope, and the Clay and Baade 6.5 m telescopes at the Las Campanas Magellan Observatories. Also based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Rsearch in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with HST program 9744., Theoretical models are presented for the envelope of Procyon A. Procyon A is known to have a shallow convection zone. We investigate the depth of the convection zone, the efficiency of convection in the convection region, convective velocities and uncertainties in the efficiency of diffusion from the convection zone into the adjacent radiative layers. The effects of turbulent pressure and turbulent kinetic energy are included in the models, based on a parameterization of 3D simulations of radiative hydrodynamics. The conditions for the stochastic excitation of acoustic non-radial oscillations are investigated. <P />This work is supported in part by grants from NASA (PD, SB, FJR), NSF (SB, LHL) and NSERC (DBG)., CLEAN is an approach to the detection of weakly interacting particles of astrophysical significance, combining large mass and low energy threshold. CLEAN is capable of detecting low energy solar neutrinos, weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), and neutrinos released from supernovas. Because liquid neon has a high scintillation yield, has no long-lived radioactive isotopes, and can be easily purified using cold traps, it is an ideal medium for the detection of rare nuclear events. In addition, neon is inexpensive, dense, and transparent to its own scintillation light, making it practical for use in a large self-shielding apparatus. The center of the full-sized CLEAN detector would be a stainless steel tank holding approximately 100 metric tons of liquid neon. Inside the tank and suspended in the liquid neon would be several thousand photomultipliers. The scientific promise and technical challenges of CLEAN will be discussed., We present optical, HI and radio continuum observations of ongoing ram-pressure stripping and dense cloud ablation in the Virgo edge-on Sc galaxy NGC 4402. VLA HI and radio continuum maps show a truncated gas disk and extraplanar emission to the NW of the plane of the galaxy. The Hα image shows many HII complexes along the SE edge of the disk, presumably star formation triggered by the ICM pressure. Optical B, V, and R images at 0.5"" resolution taken with the WIYN telescope show a remarkable dust lane morphology: the dust lane of the galaxy curves up and out of the disk, matching the HI morphology. To the south of the main ridge of interstellar material, where the galaxy is relatively clean of gas and dust, we have discovered remarkable linear dust filaments with a position angle of 40<SUP>o</SUP>. This position angle matches extraplanar radio continuum emission edges; we interpret this angle as the projected ICM wind direction. One of the observed dust filaments has an HII region at its head. We interpret these dust filaments as dense clouds which were initially left behind as the low-density ISM is stripped, but then are ablated by the ICM. These results provide striking new evidence on the fate of molecular clouds of cluster galaxies as they are stripped of their ISM., Cosmological observations show that dark energy dominates the current energy density of the universe. The equation of state relating the pressure and energy density of this dark energy, p = w ρ, appears to have w ≃ -1, with most analyses preferring w&lt;-1. Dark energy with w&lt;-1 causes the universe to undergo superexponential expansion in which the scale factor, expansion rate, and energy density of the universe diverge in a finite time. I will present the recent hypothesis (Gawiser 2003, astro-ph/0312440) that w&gt;-1 is restored due to a phase transition at high energy density and show that this produces conditions observationally indistinguishable from the Hot Big Bang. Hence the current dark energy can serve as initial conditions for an apparent Big Bang without a spacetime singularity. This process of rejuvenation may have occurred in our past, making our universe much older than it appears., The foremost answer to the above question is that high-precision global biostratigraphy extends only to Early Cambrian time. A more challenging issue concerns paleomagnetic data from the Ediacaran (proposed terminal Proterozoic period) and earliest Cambrian intervals: each paleocontinent's apparent polar wander path shows a large spread in poles, intriguingly distributed around a great circle (excepting Baltica, see below), and implying rates of paleolatitude translation or rotation far exceeding typical values from the Cenozoic. Oscillatory true polar wander (TPW) has been proposed to explain these great-circle distributions, but as more data are gathered the number of required episodes increases steadily. Another mechanism to explain such jumpy datasets is a persistently nonaxial geomagnetic field, with greatly amplified paleosecular variation; however, such an interpretation is unattractive to many geodynamicists. A third approach to explain the anomalous data is to discount them altogether; this is unsatisfactory because some of the most reliable results (e.g., Grenville dykes B component and Bunyeroo Formation pole) must be discarded in order to simplify the paths. We propose a new technique for Ediacaran-Cambrian continental reconstruction, which uses these intriguing great circle pole paths regardless of how they were generated. Each paleocontinent's path yields a best-fit great circle and corresponding pole. In the TPW interpretation, that pole describes the long-lived, common (equatorial) axis to the oscillatory rotations. Given that age constraints on the poles is generally so poor, we may reconstruct each continent to this axis with azimuthal freedom. This is topologically identical to the longitudinal degeneracy of standard paleomagnetic reconstructions, but in the case of TPW uncertainties in positions along the great circle represent uncertainties in paleolatitudes, hence climate zones. Analysis of the global Ediacaran-Cambrian paleomagnetic database indicates that all reconstructed Gondwanaland fragments share the same great circle except Arabia, whose circle is offset slightly indicating late rotations during Pan-African accretion. Iapetus can be made wide or narrow, but the latter paleogeography is preferred according to the age of Appalachian rift successions. Siberia remains on the equator, near the pole to its great circle of paleomagnetic results. Baltica is the poorest constrained of any Ediacaran-Cambrian continent: no existing paleogeographic model, with or without TPW, can readily explain its highly divergent paleomagnetic poles., We present the third installment of the Yale/San Juan Southern Proper Motion Catalog, SPM3. Absolute proper motions, positions, and photographic BV photometry are given for roughly 10.7 million objects, primarily stars, down to a magnitude of V=17.5. The catalog covers an irregular area of 3700 deg<SUP>2</SUP>, between the declinations of -20° and -45°, excluding the Galactic plane. The proper-motion precision for well-measured stars is estimated to be 4.0 mas yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Unlike previous releases of the SPM Catalog, the proper motions are on the International Celestial Reference System by way of Hipparcos catalog stars and have an estimated systematic uncertainty of 0.4 mas yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The SPM3 Catalog is available via electronic transfer. As an example of the potential of the SPM3 proper motions, we examine the Galactocentric velocities of a group of metal-poor, main-sequence A stars. The majority of these exhibit thick-disk kinematics, lending support to their interpretation as thick-disk blue stragglers, as opposed to being an accreted component., Recent analyses of solar photospheric abundances suggest that the oxygen abundance in the solar atmosphere needs to be revised downward. In this study, we investigate the consequence of this revision on helioseismic analyses of the depth of the solar convection zone and the helium abundance in the solar envelope and find no significant effect. We also find that the revised abundances along with the current OPAL opacity tables are not consistent with seismic data. A significant upward revision of the opacity tables is required to make solar models with lower oxygen abundance consistent with seismic observations., Intermediate degree modes of the solar oscillations have previously been used to determine the solar helium abundance to a high degree of precision. However, we cannot expect to observe such modes in other stars. In this work we investigate whether low degree modes that should be available from space-based asteroseismology missions can be used to determine the helium abundance, Y, in stellar envelopes with sufficient precision. We find that the oscillatory signal in the frequencies caused by the depression in Γ<SUB>1</SUB> in the second helium ionization zone can be used to determine the envelope helium abundance of low-mass main-sequence stars. For frequency errors of one part in 10<SUP>4</SUP>, we expect errors σ<SUB>Y</SUB> in the estimated helium abundance to range from 0.03 for 0.8-M<SUB>solar</SUB> stars to 0.01 for 1.2-M<SUB>solar</SUB> stars. The task is more complicated in evolved stars, such as subgiants, but is still feasible if the relative errors in the frequencies are less than 10<SUP>-4</SUP>., We have searched the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters (FIRST) and the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) 1.4 GHz radio surveys for sources that are coincident with emission-line galaxy (ELG) candidates from the KPNO International Spectroscopic Survey (KISS). A total of 207 of the 2157 KISS ELGs (~10%) in the first two Hα-selected survey lists were found to possess radio detections in FIRST, NVSS, or both. Follow-up spectra exist for all of the radio detections, allowing us to determine the activity type (star-forming vs. active nucleus) for the entire sample. We explore the properties of the radio-detected KISS galaxies in order to gain a better insight into the nature of radio-emitting galaxies in the local universe (z&lt;0.1). No dwarf galaxies were detected, despite the large numbers of low-luminosity galaxies present in KISS, suggesting that lower mass, lower luminosity objects do not possess strong galaxian-scale magnetic fields. Because of the selection technique used for KISS, our radio ELGs represent a quasi-volume-limited sample, which allows us to develop a clearer picture of the radio galaxy population at low redshift. Nearly two-thirds of the KISS radio galaxies are starburst or star-forming galaxies, which is in stark contrast to the results of flux-limited radio surveys, which are dominated by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and elliptical galaxies (i.e., classical radio galaxies). While there are many AGNs among the KISS radio galaxies, there are no objects with large radio powers in our local volume. We derive a radio luminosity function (RLF) for the KISS ELGs that agrees very well with previous RLFs that adequately sample the lower luminosity radio population., We present a preliminary theoretical seismic study of the astronomically famous star 51 Peg. This is done by first performing a detailed analysis within the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD). Using the Yale stellar evolution code (YREC), a grid of stellar evolutionary tracks has been constructed for the masses 1.00, 1.05, and 1.10 M<SUB>solar</SUB>, in the metallicity range Z=0.024-0.044, and for values of the Galactic helium enrichment ratio (ΔY/ΔZ) in the range 0-2.5. Along these evolutionary tracks, we select 75 stellar model candidates that fall within the 51 Peg observational error box in the HRD (all turn out to have masses of 1.05 and 1.10M<SUB>solar</SUB>). The corresponding allowable age range for these models, which depends sensitively on the parameters of the model, is relatively large, ~2.5-5.5 Gyr. For each of the 75 models, a nonradial pulsation analysis is carried out and the large- and small-frequency spacings are calculated. The results show that just measuring the large- and small-frequency spacings will greatly reduce the present uncertainties in the derived physical parameters and in the age of 51 Peg. Finally, we briefly discuss refinements in the physics of the models and in the method of analysis, which will have to be included in future models to make the best of the precise frequency determinations expected from space observations., We have measured proton and α -particle branching ratios of states formed using the <SUP>19 </SUP><SUB> </SUB>F ( <SUP>3</SUP>He ,t ) <SUP>19 </SUP><SUB> </SUB>Ne<SUP>*</SUP> reaction at a beam energy of 25 MeV . These ratios have a large impact on the astrophysical reaction rates of <SUP>15 </SUP><SUB> </SUB>O ( α,γ ) <SUP>19 </SUP><SUB> </SUB>Ne , <SUP>18 </SUP><SUB> </SUB>F ( p,γ ) <SUP>19 </SUP><SUB> </SUB>Ne , and <SUP>18 </SUP><SUB> </SUB>F ( p,α ) <SUP>15 </SUP><SUB> </SUB>O , which are of interest in understanding energy generation in x-ray bursts and in interpreting anticipated γ -ray observations of novae. We detected decay protons and α particles using a silicon detector array in coincidence with tritons measured in the focal plane detector of our Enge split-pole spectrograph. The silicon array consists of five strip detectors of the type used in the Louvain-Edinburgh Detector Array, subtending angles from 130° to 165° with ≈14% lab efficiency. The correlation angular distributions give additional confidence in some prior spin-parity assignments that were based on γ branchings. We measure Γ<SUB>p</SUB> /Γ=0.387±0.016 for the 665 keV proton resonance, which agrees well with the direct measurement of Bardayan et al., (U-Th)/He chronometry of zircon has a wide range of potential applications including thermochronometry, provided the temperature sensitivity (e.g., closure temperature) of the system be accurately constrained. We have examined the characteristics of He loss from zircon in a series of step-heating diffusion experiments, and compared zircon (U-Th)/He ages with other thermochronometric constraints from plutonic rocks. Diffusion experiments on zircons with varying ages and U-Th contents yield Arrhenius relationships which, after about 5% He release, indicate E <SUB>a</SUB> = 163-173 kJ/mol (39-41 kcal/mol), and D <SUB>0</SUB> = 0.09-1.5 cm <SUP>2</SUP>/s, with an average E <SUB>a</SUB> of 169 ± 3.8 kJ/mol (40.4 ± 0.9 kcal/mol) and average D <SUB>0</SUB> of 0.46 <SUP>+0.87</SUP><SUB>-0.30</SUB> cm <SUP>2</SUP>/s. The experiments also suggest a correspondence between diffusion domain size and grain size. For effective grain radius of 60 μm and cooling rate of 10°C/myr, the diffusion data yield closure temperatures, T <SUB>c</SUB>, of 171-196°C, with an average of 183°C. The early stages of step heating experiments show complications in the form of decreasing apparent diffusivity with successive heating steps, but these are essentially absent in later stages, after about 5-10% He release. These effects are independent of radiation dosage and are also unlikely to be due to intracrystalline He zonation. Regardless of the physical origin, this non-Arrhenius behavior is similar to predictions based on degassing of multiple diffusion domains, with only a small proportion (&lt;2-4%) of gas residing in domains with a lower diffusivity than the bulk zircon crystal. Thus the features of zircon responsible for these non-Arrhenius trends in the early stages of diffusion experiments would have a negligible effect on the bulk thermal sensitivity and closure temperature of a zircon crystal. We have also measured single-grain zircon (U-Th)/He ages and obtained <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar ages for several minerals, including K-feldspar, for a suite of slowly cooled samples with other thermochronologic constraints. Zircon He ages from most samples have 1 σ reproducibilities of about 1-5%, and agree well with K-feldspar <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar multidomain cooling models for sample-specific closure temperatures (170-189°C). One sample has a relatively poor reproducibility of ∼24%, however, and a mean that falls to older ages than predicted by the K-feldspar model. Microimaging shows that trace element zonation of a variety of styles is most pronounced in this sample, which probably leads to poor reproducibility via inaccurate α-ejection corrections. We present preliminary results of a new method for characterizing U-Th zonation in dated grains by laser-ablation, which significantly improves zircon He age accuracy. In summary, the zircon (U-Th)/He thermochronometer has a closure temperature of 170-190°C for typical plutonic cooling rates and crystal sizes, it is not significantly affected by radiation damage except in relatively rare cases of high radiation dosage with long-term low-temperature histories, and most ages agree well with constraints provided by K-spar <SUP>40</SUP>Ar/ <SUP>39</SUP>Ar cooling models. In some cases, intracrystalline U-Th zonation can result in inaccurate ages, but depth-profiling characterization of zonation in dated grains can significantly improve accuracy and precision of single-grain ages., We present the discovery of a high-redshift, X-ray-selected active galactic nucleus (AGN) by the Calan-Yale Deep Extragalactic Research (CYDER) survey: CXOCY J033716.7-050153, located at z=4.61, the second high-redshift AGN discovered by this survey. Here we present its optical, near-IR, and X-ray properties and compare it with other optical and X-ray-selected high-redshift AGNs. The optical luminosity of this object is significantly lower than most optically selected high-redshift quasars. It also has a lower rest-frame UV to X-ray emission ratio than most known quasars at this redshift. This mild deviation can be explained either by dust obscuring the UV radiation of a normal radio-quiet AGN emitting at 10% of its Eddington luminosity or because this is intrinsically a low-luminosity radio-loud AGN with a supermassive black hole of ~10<SUP>8</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> emitting at 1% of its Eddington luminosity. Deep radio observations can discriminate between these two hypotheses. <P />Partly based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile, under program 72.A-0509., Oxygen isotope exchange between H <SUB>2</SUB>O and H <SUB>4</SUB>SiO <SUB>4</SUB> was modeled with ab initio calculations on H <SUB>4</SUB>SiO <SUB>4</SUB> + 7H <SUB>2</SUB>O. Constrained optimizations were performed with the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) method to determine reactants, transition states, and intermediates. Long-range solvation was accounted for using self-consistent reaction field calculations. The mechanism for exchange involves two steps, a concerted proton transfer from H <SUB>4</SUB>SiO <SUB>4</SUB> forming a 5-coordinated Si followed by a concerted proton transfer from the 5-coordinated Si forming another H <SUB>4</SUB>SiO <SUB>4</SUB>. The 5-coordinated Si intermediate is C2 symmetric. At 298K and with implicit solvation included, the Gibbs free energy of activation from transition state theory is 66 kJ/mol and the predicted rate constant is 16 s <SUP>-1</SUP>. Equilibrium calculations between 298K and 673K yield α <SUB>H4SiO4-H2O</SUB> that are uniformly less than, but similar to, α <SUB>qtz-H2O</SUB>, and therefore α <SUB>qtz-H4SiO4</SUB> is expected to be relatively small in this temperature range., The frequent formation of large igneous provinces during the opening of the Atlantic Ocean is a surface manifestation of the thermal and chemical state of convecting mantle beneath the supercontinent Pangea. Recent geochemical and geophysical findings from the North Atlantic igneous province all point to the significant role of incomplete mantle mixing in igneous petrogenesis. On the basis of a whole-mantle convection model with chemical tracers, I demonstrate that sublithospheric convection driven by surface cooling can bring up dense fertile mantle without a thermal anomaly. When small-scale convection in the upper mantle breaks down into the lower mantle, strong counter upwelling takes place, entraining a large amount of dense crustal fragments accumulated at the base of the mantle transition zone. This multi-scale mantle mixing could potentially explain a variety of hotspot phenomenology as well as the formation of both volcanic and non-volcanic rifted margins, with a spatially and temporally varying distribution of fertile mantle., With the 1 m Schmidt telescope of the Llano del Hato Observatory and the QUEST CCD camera, 380 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of the sky have been surveyed for RR Lyrae variables in a band 2.3d wide in declination (centered at δ=-1°) and covering right ascensions from 4h1 to 6h1 and from 8h0 to 17h0. The bright limit (due to CCD saturation) and the faint limit are V~13.5 and ~19.7, respectively, which correspond to ~4 and ~60 kpc from the Sun. We present a catalog of the positions, amplitudes, mean magnitudes, periods, and light curves of the 498 RR Lyrae variables that have been identified in this region of the sky. The majority of these stars (86%) are new discoveries. The completeness of the survey has been estimated from simulations that model the periods and light curves of real RR Lyrae variables and take into account the pattern of epochs of observation. While the completeness of the survey varies with apparent magnitude and with position, almost everywhere in the surveyed region it is quite high (&gt;80%) for the type ab RR Lyrae variables and between 30% and 90% for the low-amplitude type c variables. <P />Based on observations collected at the 1 m Schmidt Telescope of the Llano del Hato Observatory, Venezuela., This paper describes three-dimensional (3D) large eddy simulations of stellar surface convection using realistic model physics. The simulations include the present Sun, a subgiant of one solar mass and a lower-gravity subgiant, also of one solar mass. We examine the thermal structure (superadiabaticity) after modification by 3D turbulence, the overshoot of convective motions into the radiative atmosphere and the range of convection cell sizes. Differences between models based on the mixing length theory (MLT) and the simulations are found to increase significantly in the more evolved stages as the surface gravity decreases. We find that the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the turbulent vertical velocity correlation provides a good objective measure of the vertical size of the convective cells. Just below the convection surface, the FWHM is close to the mean vertical size of the granules and 2 × FWHM is close to the mean horizontal diameter of the granules. For the Sun, 2 × FWHM = 1200 km, a value close to the observed mean granule size. For all the simulations, the mean horizontal diameter is close to 10 times the pressure scaleheight at the photospheric surface, in agreement with previous work., Astronomy in the next decade will be dominated by multi-wavelength surveys which address a wide variety of scientific issues including galaxy formation and evolution, AGN structure and demographics and galactic structure. The great observatories origins deep survey (GOODS) is a deep multi-wavelength public survey of two of the deepest fields ever studied, HDF-N and CDF-S, covering approximately 330 arcmin <SUP>2</SUP>. It comprises a SIRTF legacy program, an HST treasury program and the deepest X-ray observations with Chandra and XMM-Newton. Furthermore, GOODS includes extensive follow-up studies with several ground-based facilities. It is thus clear that GOODS will generate the deepest, largest and most uniform panchromatic data-set to study the distant universe. In this paper I give a short review of the current status of the GOODS survey, concentrating on issues related to the AGN research., A long-standing problem in astrophysics is whether galaxy mergers necessarily lead to massive black hole mergers in their centers. Over the past 20 years this problem has been studied in context of the long-term evolution of a black hole binary at the center of a dense stellar system. However, the fate of a binary in the stellar system is unclear and the coalescence possibly stalls unless some additional mechanism is able to extract angular momentum from the binary. The possible additional mechanism is very likely to be gas dynamical in origin, because observational and theoretical work both indicate that large amounts of gas can be present in the central regions of merging galaxies. Using high-resolution SPH numerical simulations, we investigate the effects of gas on the inspiral and merger of a massive black hole binary. We run a variety of models, ranging from simulations with a relatively smooth gas and nearly spherical cloud to cases in which the gas is in a disk and has a more clumpy spatial distribution. <P />We find that in the early evolution of the system the binary separation diminishes due to gravitational drag, and in the later stages the medium responds by forming an ellipsoidal density enhancement whose axis lags behind the binary axis; this offset produces a torque on the binary that causes continuing loss of angular momentum and is able to reduce the separation to distances where gravitational radiation is efficient. Between these two regimes, we find a transition regime in which the evolution is temporarily slowed down when neither of these mechanisms is fully effective. In the variety of simulations that we perform, we find that a MBH binary will merge within few times 10 7 yrs after the galaxies merge. For MBHs that satisfy the observed' m - s c ' relation, we predict that in a merger of galaxies that have at least 1% of their total mass in gas, the MBHs will coalesce soon after the galaxies merge. We also predict that if the MBHs depart considerably from the ' m - s c ' relation, strong tidal and/or resonant forces from the MBH binary can create a circumbinary gap in the disk that stalls the coalescence, but this gap formation can act as a self-regulatory mechanism on MBH growth that can help to explain the existence of the ' m - s c ' relation. <P />Finally, we study accretion onto a MBH binary in a massive spherical gas cloud. We find that when the MBHs are close enough so that orbital effects become important, the Bondi-Hoyle theory overestimates the mass accretion rate by a factor of ten. In the cases that we study, we find accretion rates that are well above the Eddington accretion rate. The implications of accretion for the coalescence of the binary is that accretion tends to accelerate the process., We consider spherically symmetric spacetimes with matter whose timelike flow is assumed to be shear-free. A number of results on the formation and visibility of spacetime singularities is proven, with the main one being that shear-free collapse cannot admit locally naked singularities (which implies the absence of globally naked singularities). We conjecture that shear is a necessary condition for the occurrence of locally naked singularities in generic gravitational collapse., We present a numerical study of the dynamics of supermassive black holes (SMBH) in a gaseous medium. The importance of the study relies on its implications for the fate of SMBH in mergers of protogalaxies with large amounts of gas and in the accretion history of SMBH. We investigate the evolution of a binary SMBH in a gaseous sphere for different M<SUB>gas</SUB> / M<SUB>binary</SUB> ratios and for different equations of state (adiabatic, isothermal), in particular focusing on the merging timescales of the SMBH's leaving the role of accretion for future work., We have investigated the global properties of the globular cluster (GC) systems of three early-type galaxies: the Virgo Cluster elliptical NGC 4406, the field elliptical NGC 3379, and the field S0 galaxy NGC 4594. These galaxies were observed as part of a wide-field CCD survey of the GC populations of a large sample of normal galaxies beyond the Local Group. Images obtained with the Mosaic detector on the Kitt Peak 4 m telescope provide radial coverage to at least 24', or ~70-100 kpc. We use BVR photometry and image classification to select GC candidates and thereby reduce contamination from non-GCs, as well as Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 data to help quantify the contamination that remains. The GC systems of all three galaxies have color distributions with at least two peaks and show modest negative color gradients. The proportions of blue GCs range from 60% to 70% of the total populations. The GC specific frequency (S<SUB>N</SUB>) of NGC 4406 is 3.5+/-0.5, ~20% lower than past estimates and nearly identical to S<SUB>N</SUB> for the other Virgo Cluster elliptical included in our survey, NGC 4472. S<SUB>N</SUB> for NGC 3379 and NGC 4594 are 1.2+/-0.3 and 2.1+/-0.3, respectively; these are similar to past values, but the errors have been reduced by a factor of 2-3. We compare our results for the early-type sample (including NGC 4472) to models for the formation of massive galaxies and their GC systems. Of the scenarios we consider, a hierarchical merging picture, in which metal-poor GCs form at high redshift in protogalactic building blocks and metal-rich GC populations are built up over time during subsequent gas-rich mergers, appears most consistent with the data., Data collected by the Mars Odyssey Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) and Mars Exploration Rover Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometers (MER-APXS) will allow for unprecedented chemical information to be obtained from the Martian surface. Phosphorous and iron are two elements that should be measured with some accuracy by MER-APXS (as opposed to MPF). The well-known affinity of iron oxide/hydroxides for sorption of phosphate in oceans, lakes, rivers, and soils will be used to assess the utility of P/Fe (in conjunction with other elements and element ratios measurable by MER-APXS) as an indicator of aqueous activity at the two 2004 MER landing sites. Iron oxide/hydroxides are also an effective sink for Th in terrestrial waters; thus, GRS data may also be valuable in evaluating the nature of aqueous alteration (or lack thereof) at the MER landing sites. For example, the hematite-bearing deposit in Sinus Meridiani (2S, 4W) has a high Th concentration and low K/Th, suggesting that sorption of Th by specular hematite in aqueous solution may have occurred at some point in the geologic history of this region of Mars. Experiments on the sorptive properties of specular hematite and palagonite for PO4 and Th will be used to develop a model for the role of water in formation of deposits at the two MER landing sites., The current status of the Yale/San Juan SPM program is presented. The recently released SPM3 Catalog is a near-complete catalog to V=17.5, providing absolute proper motions for 10.7 million objects. The proper-motion precision, for well-measured stars, is 4 mas/yr and the estimated systematic uncertainty is 0.4 mas/yr. In addition to our photographic B and V magnitudes, a cross-identification with the 2MASS all sky survey provides high-quality infrared photometry for virtually all SPM3 objects. As an example of the Catalog's scientific value, we present two simple applications of the SPM3 data: 1) a measure of the velocity shear, as a function of z, at the South Galactic Pole, and 2) a kinematic classification of Rodgers' metal-poor, main-sequence A stars. <P />The second-epoch of the SPM is currently being completed with CCD observations, using the same 51-cm double astrograph at El Leoncito, Argentina that was employed in the first-epoch photography. The camera system is described and, as a test case, the CCD data are used to measure the absolute proper motion of the bulge globular cluster, NGC5927. <P />The primary motivation of the SPM program is to provide fundamental data for kinematic studies of the various components of the Milky Way. Recent objective-prism surveys in the southern hemisphere have produced thousands of radial velocities and metallicity estimates for stars of the thick-disk and halo populations. In the near future, the RAVE-II survey will obtain similar information for tens of millions of stars. When combined with accurate proper motions from SPM, we will have the opportunity for unprecedented analysis of the kinematic and dynamical properties of the thick-disk and halo populations. <P />This work has received partial support from NSF grants AST-0098508, AST-0098549, AST-0098548, and AST-0098687., The underlying goal of studies of the phenomenology of AGN characteristics is to relate correlations among properties to physical processes and their parameters. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical tool that has been used with great success to determine correlations among AGN properties, but an understanding of the physical processes responsible for the relationships discovered using PCA (most notably that set of relationships known as Eigenvector 1) has yet to be achieved. The SDSS, with its large size, uniform quality and well-defined selection criteria, promises to be a valuable part of understanding these relationships. A preliminary analysis of 120 EDR quasars and 80 DR1 quasars reveals that the Eigenvector 1 trends are strongly present in SDSS quasars and that [OII] and [OIII] luminosities are correlated with the Eigenvector 1 properties. Those objects emitting near their Eddington limits, with [OIII] too broad for their black hole mass, display blue asymmetries on their [OIII] lines. Principal component analysis of all 200 SDSS quasars combined with the sample of PG quasars was also conducted, revealing strong, well-defined Eigenvector 1 trends. <P />Hughes's research was supported by the NOAO/KPNO Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program which is funded by the National Science Foundation through Scientific Program Order No. 3 (AST-0243875) of the Cooperative Agreement No. AST-0132798 between the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) and the NSF., We report results of two nights of time-series spectroscopy of the pulsating pre-white dwarf star PG 0122+200 with the LRIS instrument on the Keck II telescope. We are able for the first time to measure the temperature changes in such a star over the pulsation cycle. This provides an important test for the NLTE model atmospheres used to analyze these extremely hot stars., The Palomar-QUEST Variability Survey is now in routine data taking mode using the 1.3m Oschin Schmidt Telescope at Palomar Observatory with the 112 CCD Large Area QUEST Camera. Data are taken in the drift scan mode 10 to 12 nights each month, producing of the order of 50 gigabytes of data during a clear night, covering about 500 square degrees of sky in four colors essentially simultaneously. We have written a data processing pipeline to process this large volume of data, with the capability of processing each night's data during the following day. The pipeline does astrometry and photometry using both aperture and point spread function (PSF) fitting in four colors. <P />Each night's data are transferred automatically via a microwave link and internet to CalTech and Yale during the next day. We are establishing online data archives both at Yale and CalTech to store this raw data and make it readily available to users. The archives will be of the order of 10 terabytes each, consisting of RAID arrays of magnetic discs. The two archives will both contain the identical full data set to serve as backup to each other in case of equipment failure., We have undertaken a survey of the globular cluster (GC) systems of a large sample of elliptical and spiral galaxies, with the aim of using their observed properties to test models of galaxy formation. The survey combines wide-field, ground-based CCD imaging with archival Hubble Space Telescope data to determine the total numbers, spatial distributions and color distributions of GCs around the galaxies. We use photometry in three filters and image analysis to reduce contamination in the GC candidate samples. As a result, they are up to an order of magnitude less contaminated than those of past studies. Furthermore, we typically have more than twice the radial coverage of previous CCD surveys. <P />In this thesis, I present results for the GC system properties of six galaxies spanning a range of morphological types, from ellipticals to late-type spirals. The derived spatial distributions suggest that we have observed the full radial extent of the galaxies' GC systems. Using these distributions, we derive global values for the total number (N<SUB>GC</SUB>) and specific frequency (S<SUB>N</SUB>) of GCs in each galaxy. The S<SUB>N</SUB> values for three of the five galaxies studied previously are reduced by 20-75%, and in all cases the errors are 2-3 times smaller. The GC systems of the early-type galaxies have multimodal color distributions and modest negative color gradients. We compare the relative numbers of blue (metal-poor) GCs in the galaxies and find that merging the GC populations of spirals can account for the blue GCs in a moderate-luminosity field elliptical, but is insufficient to account for the blue GC populations of luminous cluster ellipticals. Furthermore, we find a rough trend in the sense that more luminous galaxies have larger relative numbers of blue GCs. Finally, we find that N<SUB>GC</SUB> in spirals seems to depend primarily on the luminosity of the galaxy and find little or no correlation with morphological type or bulge properties. Our results seem to point toward a picture of galaxy and GC system formation in which metal-poor GCs form at high redshift in protogalactic building blocks and metal-rich GC populations are built up over time during subsequent gaseous mergers., We consider four-dimensional spacetimes (M, g) which obey the Einstein equations G = T and admit a global spacelike G_{1}={\bb R} isometry group. By means of dimensional reduction and local analysis on the reduced (2 + 1) spacetime, we obtain a sufficient condition on T which guarantees that (M, g) cannot contain apparent horizons. Given any (3 + 1) spacetime with spacelike translational isometry, the no-horizon condition can be readily tested without the need for dimensional reduction. This provides thus a useful and encompassing apparent horizon test for G<SUB>1</SUB>-symmetric spacetimes. We argue that this adds further evidence towards the validity of the hoop conjecture and signals possible (albeit arguably unlikely) violations of strong cosmic censorship., We have reestimated the surface density of the Galactic disk in the solar neighborhood within +/-0.4 kpc of the Sun using the parallaxes and proper motions of a kinematically and spatially unbiased sample of 1476 old bright red giant stars from the Hipparcos catalog with measured radial velocities from Barbier-Brossat &amp; Figon. We determine the vertical distribution of the red giants as well as the vertical velocity dispersion of the sample (14.4+/-0.3 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) and combine these to derive the surface density of the gravitating matter in the Galactic disk as a function of the Galactic coordinate z. The surface density of the disk increases from 10.5+/-0.5 M<SUB>solar</SUB> pc<SUP>-2</SUP> within +/-50 pc to 42+/-6 M<SUB>solar</SUB> pc<SUP>-2</SUP> within +/-350 pc. The estimated volume density of the Galactic disk within +/-50 pc is about 0.1 M<SUB>solar</SUB> pc<SUP>-3</SUP> which is close to the volume density estimates of the observed baryonic matter in the solar neighborhood., Ludwig Friedrich Oster died at the Anchorage Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in <P />Salisbury, MD on 28 February 2003, of complications from advanced Alzheimer's <P />disease. He is survived by his wife Cheryl M. (Oroian) and his two children by a <P />previous marriage, Ulrika and Mattias Oster. He had a distinguished career both as a <P />researcher in solar physics and as a science administrator in the National Science <P />Foundation. <P />Ludwig was born on 8 March 1931 in Konstanz, Germany and emigrated to the U.S. in <P />1958, acquiring American citizenship in 1963. His mother and father were Emma <P />Josefine (Schwarz) and Ludwig Friedrich Oster. He got a BS degree in physics at the <P />University of Freiburg under the guidance of Prof. K. O. Kiepenheuer in 1951, and a <P />MS (1954) and PhD from the University of Kiel in 1956 under the guidance of Prof. A. <P />Unsold. From 1956 to 1958 he was a Fellow of the German Science Council at Kiel and, <P />upon his arrival to the US in 1958, he became a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the <P />Physics Department of Yale University. He became an Assistant Professor of Physics <P />and Astrophysics at Yale in 1960 and five years later he was promoted to Associate <P />Professor. In 1967 he became an Associate Professor of Physics and Astrophysics at the <P />University of Colorado and a Fellow of the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics; <P />he was promoted to Full Professor in 1970. In 1981 he was a Visiting Professor at Johns <P />Hopkins University, and shortly thereafter became a National Research Council Senior <P />Associate at NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD, where he worked on <P />solar variability. He joined the National Science Foundation in 1983, where he became <P />the Program Manager for the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in the Division of <P />Astronomical Sciences of the Foundation; he remained there until his retirement in 1996. <P />His early work, started in Germany and continued at Yale, concerned radiation <P />mechanisms related to solar phenomena. His works on cyclotron radiation, plasma <P />oscillations and bremsstrahlung radiation have become classic publications in plasma <P />physics and they continue to be referenced in the current literature. During this period he <P />started his student mentoring work that led to the awarding of several PhD degrees. <P />At Boulder, he extended his work on solar and plasma physics to the newly discovered <P />quasars and pulsars. He loved to study and understand the mysterious and the puzzling <P />phenomena, which the Universe so generously provides. <P />While at Goddard, he joined the effort to understand the variations in total solar <P />irradiance then recently discovered by the Nimbus 7 satellite and the ACRIM experiment <P />on the SMM satellite. He made significant contributions to that problem, particularly <P />regarding the ultraviolet radiation component, and continued to work on it after he had <P />joined the NSF as a science administrator. He published his last scientific paper in 1983, <P />after having joined NSF. <P />Ludwig was a great teacher and an even greater friend. He taught courses including <P />electromagnetic theory, relativistic theory of radiation, quantum mechanics, solar physics <P />and radio astronomy among others. He wrote an introductory textbook in astronomy that <P />was translated into several languages. He directed PhD theses in a variety of topics. Best <P />of all, he instilled in his students a sense of curiosity and confidence that lasted for a <P />lifetime. He used to say, ``if what you think disagrees with the opinion of well-known <P />astronomers, do not simply assume that you are wrong and they are right. It may well be <P />that you are right! Think carefully about it."" That advice has served all of us, his former <P />students, well. We will miss his cheerful disposition, his friendliness, and his never- <P />ending curiosity., The nearby M81/M82 group of galaxies is embedded in a cloud of neutral hydrogen that traces the history of the interaction between these galaxies. At 3.5 Mpc the M81/M82 group is one of the closest groups. <P />A complete census of dwarf galaxies and high velocity clouds (HVCs) in the M81 group is important for understanding the mass distribution of this group. We set a 6σ detection limit for H<SUB>I</SUB> of 3×10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. This study has relevance to studies of our own Galaxy/Local group. The exact location of HVCs surrounding our galaxy still remains a puzzle. Our observations show the M81/M82 group has connected streams of hydrogen, not isolated clouds., We will present initial results from MUSYC, the Multiwavelength Survey by Yale &amp; Chile. Our survey consists of deep optical (UBVRIz) and near-infrared (JHK) imaging of four quarter-square-degree fields on the sky, centered on CDF-S, HDF-S, SDSS1030+05, and Cast1255+01. Three of these fields have existing or approved space-based coverage, including SIRTF, Chandra, XMM, GALEX, and HST-ACS. We will measure the luminosity functions and clustering properties of quasars, protogalaxies, and evolved optical break galaxies at z=3. A proper motion survey will probe Galactic structure by detecting halo white dwarfs. A detailed study of the objects found is being performed through multislit spectroscopy on VLT, Gemini, and Magellan. Our optical images of the HDF-S will be released to the astronomy community in the near future.

The time scales for these events depend on the mass, distance, and velocity of the lensing objects. It has been suggested that the observed lensing time scales are consistent with a population of white dwarfs in the galactic halo. Using realistic assumptions about the mass and velocity distributions, we compare the observed distribution of time scales with those expected from such a hypothetical population of halo white dwarfs. We also examine the possibility that the lensing objects are low-mass stars within the Magellanic clouds themselves. We find that this self-lensing hypothesis actually provides a better fit to the data., We present our simultaneous optical and IR observations of black-hole X-ray binaries 4U 1543-47 and GX 339-4. Observations were obtained by the YALO and SMARTS consortia when both objects were declining in soft X-rays. The most interesting feature of the data is a secondary outburst in the optical and IR light curves with no corresponding rise in the ASM X-ray light curve. In the case of 4U 1543-47 a radio detection was made at the peak of the secondary outburst. <P />A possible source of this optical/IR reflare is synchrotron radiation emitted from a jet. We explore this hypothesis in this poster and compare our results to another black-hole candidate with similar behaviour, XTE J1550-564. <P />This study is supported by the NSF., V4641 Sgr is a binary system consisting of a black hole and a Roche-lobe filling B star (Orosz et al. 2002 ApJ 568, 845). The system is an X-ray transient, and underwent a short outburst in August 2003. We report X-ray, optical and IR observations of this outburst. The X-ray lightcurve shows flares of &gt;100 mCrab on timescales as short as 1 second. The optical/IR lightcurve is also highly variable. Simultaneous optical/X-ray observations show strong correlations, with the optical somewhat delayed and smoothed compared to the X-ray. This behavior can be explained if the optical emission comes from X-rays reprocessed by the accretion disk., In this paper we study the observational signatures of the lensing signal produced by dark matter halos with embedded misaligned disks. This issue is of particular interest at present, since several of the observed multiple-lens systems have magnification ratios and image geometries that are not simultaneously well fitted by standard mass models. The presence of substructure exterior to the lens has been invoked by several authors in the context of cold dark matter (CDM) models in order to explain the anomalous magnification ratios. We emphasize that the anomalous magnification ratios may be an artifact of the simple mass models currently in use; the inclusion of a misaligned disk may be able to mimic the effect of substructure. These slight spatial offsets between the dark matter halo and the disk, which are likely to occur as a consequence of interactions or mergers, lead to complex image configurations and nonstandard magnification ratios. We investigate the effects of disk misalignment on two illustrative lenses: a spiral disk embedded within a dark matter halo, and a compact, disklike component within an early-type galaxy. The expected fraction of galaxies with a misaligned disk is estimated to be of the order of the merger fraction, since all mergers are expected to progress via a transiently misaligned phase. We find that there is a significant change in all observed lensing properties due to the added complexity of such mass profiles. In particular cases, the resulting lensing geometries are unusual, with high image multiplicities. The caustic structures-both radial and tangential-are drastically modified, and the magnification ratios differ fromexpectations from standard lens models. The additional parameters required to specify the relative alignment of multiple mass components in the primary lens introduce yet another source of uncertainty in the mass modeling of gravitational lens systems., We report that the Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasar SDSS J165043.44+425149.3 is gravitationally lensed into two images, based on observations obtained with the WIYN 3.5 m telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory. The lensed quasar, at a redshift of z=1.547, appears as two images separated by 1.2"" with B-band magnitudes of 17.8 and 20.0. The lensing galaxy is clearly detected in I-band images obtained in 0.3"" seeing after point-spread function subtraction of the two quasar images. A strong metal-line absorption system is also identified in the unresolved SDSS spectrum of the double quasar, suggesting a plausible lens redshift of z=0.58. The UBRI flux ratios of the pair vary significantly, from 8.5:1 in the blue to 5.4:1 in the red, a difference of 0.5 mag, and are likely due to differential reddening through the lensing galaxy, microlensing in one or both quasar images, or some combination of the two. Optical monitoring of the quasar pair, particularly at blue wavelengths, will be needed to determine if microlensing is indeed significant. The predicted differential time delay between the quasar images is on the order of 1 month, assuming the intervening absorption system is due to the lensing galaxy. <P />Based on observations obtained with the WIYN telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory, National Optical Astronomy Observatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation. The WIYN Observatory is a joint facility of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Indiana University, Yale University, and the National Optical Astronomy Observatory., We show that 3+1 vacuum spacetimes admitting a global, spacelike, one-parameter Lie group of isometries of translational type cannot contain apparent horizons. The only assumption made is that of the existence of a global spacelike Killing vector field with infinite open orbits; the four-dimensional vacuum spacetime metric is otherwise arbitrary. This result may thus be viewed as a hoop conjecture theorem for vacuum gravity with one spacelike translational Killing symmetry., We estimate the number of individual fast-moving stars observable in globular clusters under the assumption that the clusters contain massive central black holes that follow the galactic M<SUB>BH</SUB>-σ relationship. We find that radial velocity measurements are unlikely to detect such stars but that proper-motion studies could reveal such stars, if they exist, in the most likely clusters. Thus, Hubble Space Telescope proper-motion studies can test this hypothesis in a few nearby clusters., We present the results of a wide-field photometric study of the globular cluster (GC) system of the edge-on Sab spiral NGC 7814. This is the first spiral to be fully analyzed from our survey of the GC systems of a large sample of galaxies beyond the Local Group. NGC 7814 is of particular interest because a previous study estimated that it has 500-1000 GCs, giving it the largest specific frequency (S<SUB>N</SUB>) known for a spiral. Understanding this galaxy's GC system is important in terms of our understanding of the GC populations of spirals in general and has implications for the formation of massive galaxies. We observed the galaxy in BVR filters with the WIYN 3.5 m telescope and used image classification and three-color photometry to select GC candidates. We also analyzed archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 images of NGC 7814, both to help quantify the contamination level of the WIYN GC candidate list and to detect GCs in the inner part of the galaxy halo. Combining HST data with high-quality ground-based images allows us to trace the entire radial extent of this galaxy's GC system and determine the total number of GCs directly through observation. We find that rather than being an especially high-S<SUB>N</SUB> spiral, NGC 7814 has &lt;~200 GCs and S<SUB>N</SUB>~1, making it comparable to the two most well-studied spiral galaxies, the Milky Way and M31. We explore the implications of these results for models of the formation of galaxies and their GC systems. The initial results from our survey suggest that the GC systems of typical elliptical galaxies can be accounted for by the merger of two or more spirals, but that for highly luminous elliptical galaxies, additional physical processes may be needed., A major source of many of the light elements, including carbon and nitrogen, as well as many of the s-process elements, is low-mass stars. In this context, not only are nuclear rates important, but so to is the astrophysics of convective dredge-up and rotation. In this talk, I will review the major processes that result in the ejection from low-mass stars of an important complement of the elements of the universe., , I review current difficulties in understanding the origin of the supermassive black holes we now think reside in almost all normal to large galaxies. For example, it is not obvious how so much matter can be rapidly packed into such a small volume so as to produce the accreting supermassive black holes observed out to redshifts z &gt; 6, when the Universe less than a tenth of its current age. I then discuss possible solutions to some of these difficulties. Of interest to this conference, I will try to shed some light (not very successfully) on whether these black holes reach their current masses mainly by the accretion of gas or by the merger and coalescence of smaller black holes., Our current understanding of the physical processes of star formation is reviewed, with emphasis on processes occurring in molecular clouds like those observed nearby. The dense cores of these clouds are predicted to undergo gravitational collapse characterized by the runaway growth of a central density peak that evolves towards a singularity. As long as collapse can occur, rotation and magnetic fields do not change this qualitative behaviour. The result is that a very small embryonic star or protostar forms and grows by accretion at a rate that is initially high but declines with time as the surrounding envelope is depleted. Rotation causes some of the remaining matter to form a disk around the protostar, but accretion from protostellar disks is not well understood and may be variable. Most, and possibly all, stars form in binary or multiple systems in which gravitational interactions can play a role in redistributing angular momentum and driving episodes of disk accretion. Variable accretion may account for some peculiarities of young stars such as flareups and jet production, and protostellar interactions in forming systems of stars will also have important implications for planet formation. The most massive stars form in the densest environments by processes that are not yet well understood but may include violent interactions and mergers. The formation of the most massive stars may have similarities to the formation and growth of massive black holes in very dense environments., This study used the 3.5m WIYN telescope and its multiobject spectrograph to measure the strengths of the infrared Call triplet in 95, 70, and 34 red giants in the Draco, Ursa Minor, and Sculptor dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies, respectively. The metallicity calibration was derived from observations of red giants in globular clusters of well determined metallicity. The derived abundances from the Call triplet are consistent with the few measurements made by others at high dispersion when allowance is made for the 0.2 dex offset in [Ca/Fe] that the high dispersion studies have detected between the red giants in the dSph galaxies and the globular clusters. The metallicities from the Call triplet yield mean abundances of &lt;[Fe/H]&gt; = -1.99, -2.03, and -1.86, for Draco, Ursa Minor, and Sculptor, respectively, and wide dispersions; -3.1 ≤ [Fe/H] ≤ -1.1, -3.0 ≤ [Fe/H] ≤ -1.2, and -2.7 ≤ [Fe/H] ≤ -1.0, respectively. Although the abundance ranges are similar, the dSphs exhibit different metallicity distributions. The abundance distribution in Ursa Minor exhibits a narrow central peak. The abundance distribution in Draco may be bimodal, with statistical significance just below 90%. There is evidence for a metallicity gradient in both Draco and Sculptor, with a concentration of more metal- rich stars inside the core radius. This gradient can explain the horizontal branch and red giant branch gradients detected by others. The data in Ursa Minor are consistent with no gradient. Two variations on the “Simple Model” of chemical evolution have been compared to the metallicity distributions of these galaxies. In one, chemical evolution follows the standard closed-box model until it abruptly ends because the remaining gas is ejected by supernova driven winds. In the second, gas is lost continuously from the galaxy at a rate that is proportional to the star formation rate. Both models adequately fit the abundance distributions of Draco and Sculptor, but the continuous mass loss model fails for Ursa Minor. The sharp distribution in Ursa Minor suggests that star formation was more efficient relative to the others, removing gas more abruptly and preventing a significant metallicity gradient. The differences imply that star formation and chemical enrichment processes proceeded somewhat differently in these dSphs., Using parallaxes and proper motions of a kinematically and spatially unbiased sample of old bright red giant stars from the Hipparcos catalog with measured radial velocities from Barbier-Brossat &amp; Figon (2000), we have re-estimated the surface density of the Galactic disk in the solar neighborhood within +/- 0.4 kpc of the Sun. We determine the vertical distribution of the red giants as well as the vertical velocity dispersion of the sample, (14.4 +/- 1.5 km/sec), and combine these to derive the surface density of gravitating matter in the Galactic disk, obtaining a value of 44 +/- 9 M<SUB>sun</SUB> / pc<SUP>2</SUP> within +/- 400 pc. Furthermore, we find that this gravitating matter is concentrated within a layer of about +/- 200 pc. <P />The derived values of surface density and concentration of gravitating matter indicate the presence of a thin, dark-matter component to the Galaxy. In the mid-plane of the disk, the volume density of this flattened component is a substantial fraction of the volume density of the observed matter. <P />This work was supported in part by grant No. AST 0098548 from the National Science Foundation., We present the second gravitationally lensed quasar discovered during the course of a Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph snapshot survey for small-separation gravitational lenses. CTQ 327 is a double quasar with an image separation of 1.22"" and a g-band flux ratio of roughly 5 to 1. Spectra reveal both components to be z=1.37 quasars, and the lensing galaxy is clearly visible after point-spread function subtraction of the two quasar components. The light profile of the lensing galaxy is well modeled by an r<SUP>1/4</SUP> law, indicative of an early-type elliptical galaxy. An estimate of the lens galaxy redshift is z~0.4-0.6, based on the Faber-Jackson relationship and photometric considerations, although values outside this range are still consistent with the present data. Resolved spectra of the two quasars show similar, but not identical, continuum and emission-line features: component A exhibits weaker emission lines with respect to the continuum than does component B, and there is evidence of intrinsic differences in the emission-line profiles between the two components. Optical monitoring of the quasar pair also shows a change in the g-band flux ratio of 0.14 mag over a 3 month period. These spectral and photometric differences may be due to microlensing fluctuations from stars in the lensing galaxy, intrinsic quasar variability coupled with the system's differential time delay, or some combination of the two. The observed variability makes CTQ 327 an attractive target for future flux monitoring, aimed at time-delay or microlensing studies. <P />Based on observations obtained with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, the W. M. Keck Observatory, and the Magellan Consortium's Walter Baade Telescope. The Space Telescope Science Institute is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. The W. M. Keck Observatory is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration., We present the third installment of the Yale/San Juan Southern Proper Motion Catalog, SPM 3.0. Absolute proper motions, positions, and photographic B,V photometry are given for over 11 million objects, down to a magnitude of V=17.5. The Catalog covers an irregular area of 3700 square degrees, between the declinations of -20 and -45 degrees, and excluding the Galactic plane. All observations were made with the 50-cm double astrograph of Cesco Observatory in El Leoncito, Argentina. The Catalog is based on full-plate scans using the USNO Precision Measuring Machine (PMM) and its image detection and centering software. Almost all SPM fields for which second-epoch plates are available have been included, excepting those in the Galactic plane. The proper-motion precision, for well-measured stars, is estimated to be 4.0 mas/yr. Unlike previous releases of the SPM Catalog, the proper motions are on the International Celestial Reference System by way of Hipparcos Catalog stars, and have an estimated systematic uncertainty of 0.4 mas/yr. <P />The recently begun SPM CCD survey program is described, also. These observations will provide second-epoch astrometry, as well as improved photometry, for the remainder of the original Southern Proper Motion survey, and for future versions of the SPM Catalog. <P />This work has been supported by a series of grants from the National Science Foundation, including the current grant, AST-0098548., , We present deep Keck spectroscopy for a sample of I<SUB>814</SUB>&lt;22.5 field early-type galaxies selected morphologically in the redshift range 0.56&lt;=z&lt;=1.02 in the Hubble Deep Field-North (HDF-N). Using velocity dispersions determined from the Keck spectra in conjunction with structural parameters measured from the deep WFPC2 images, we study the evolution of the M/L<SUB>B</SUB> ratio and the fundamental plane with redshift. For the majority of galaxies, the trends observed are very similar to those determined earlier for rich clusters. The systematic offset between HDF-N galaxies and cluster galaxies is ΔlnM/L<SUB>B</SUB>=-0.14+/-0.13, corresponding to an age difference of only 16%+/-15% at z=0.88. However, we find enhanced Hδ absorption with an equivalent width of 4.0<SUP>+0.9</SUP><SUB>-0.5</SUB> Å in the mean spectrum of the 10 galaxies, indicating the presence of young stars. We infer that the galaxies have composite stellar populations, consisting of a low-mass young component in addition to a dominating old component. Since the bulk of the stellar mass must have formed at z&gt;~2, our results argue against formation scenarios involving major mergers of gas-rich disk systems at 1&lt;~z&lt;~1.5, and we conclude that z~=1 early-type galaxies were assembled either at higher redshift or in mergers involving little gas. The ubiquitous enhanced Balmer lines and the presence of tidal features in two of the galaxies lend some support to the latter hypothesis. The main uncertainty in the analysis is the small sample; larger samples of early-type galaxies are needed to study in detail the interplay between the evolution of their stellar populations and morphology. <P />Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555., Frank Schlesinger began planning for the establishment of a southern observatory when he arrived at Yale in 1920. After discussing the possibility of a location in Auckland, New Zealand and gathering site survey observations for a four-month period, he decided to select a site in Johannesburg, South Africa. A large photographically corrected 26-inch objective was ground, polished and completed by James McDowell in 1923, while the telescope was built largely in the Yale shops in New Haven. Schlesinger left New Haven in 1924 with the lens, and the telescope followed shortly thereafter. Installation of the 26-inch refractor was completed in early June and dedicated by the Prince of Wales on June 22, 1924. The principal observational program for the 26-inch refractor was the determination of parallaxes of the bright stars and it was continued until 1952, when the telescope was moved to Mt. Stromlo due to the deteriorating sky conditions in Johannesburg. The parallax program continued at Mt. Stromlo until 1963 when the telescope was donated to the Commonwealth Observatory and the Yale-Columbia project moved to Argentina, Columbia having joined with Yale in 1943. Approximately 70,000 plates were taken with the refractor for the parallax programs and about 2,000 stellar parallaxes determined. The Schlesinger 26-inch refractor was destroyed by a firestorm on January 18, 2003, along with the other telescopes on Mount Stromlo, the workshop, library and many of the residences. This event was a sad ending to a telescope that played a major role in defining our knowledge of the distances, motions and masses of the brighter stars during the first half of the 20th century., We propose to image in BVI with HST ACS/WFC the highly inclined Virgo cluster spiral galaxy NGC 4522, which is perhaps the nearest and clearest case of a galaxy whose interstellar medium {ISM} is being actively stripped by the pressure of the intracluster medium {ICM}. High resolution HST B-I mages of dust in the ISM will show important details of the interaction, such as what happens to giant molecular clouds in the interaction, how rapidly and cleanly disks are stripped, and whether star formation is triggered by ICM pressure. We will identify extraplanar star clusters which formed in the stripped gas, and from their ages and spatial distribution constrain the stripping history of NGC 4522. Only with the spatial resolution of HST can we map dust features down to the few pc scale of GMCs, and clearly identify stars clusters. In-depth study of this galaxy should provide new insight into the physical processes which occur in ICM-ISM interactions, and give us greater understanding of galaxy evolution in clusters of all types and at all redshifts., We construct models of the structure and evolution of the Sun which include variable magnetic fields and turbulence. The magnetic effects are (1) magnetic pressure, (2) magnetic energy, and (3) magnetic modulation to turbulence. The effects of turbulence are (1) turbulent pressure, (2) turbulent kinetic energy, and (3) turbulent inhibition of the radiative energy loss of a convective eddy, and (4) turbulent generation of magnetic fields. Using these ingredients we construct five types of solar variability models (including the standard solar model) with magnetic effects. These models are in part based on three-dimensional numerical simulations of the superadiabatic layers near the surface of the Sun. The models are tested with several sets of observational data, namely, the changes of (1) the total solar irradiance, (2) the photospheric temperature, (3) radius, (4) the position of the convection zone base, and (5) low- and medium-degree solar oscillation frequencies. We find that turbulence plays a major role in solar variability, and only a model that includes a magnetically modulated turbulent mechanism can agree with all the current available observational data. We find that because of the somewhat poor quality of all observations (other than the helioseismological ones), we need all data sets in order to restrict the range of models., , We propose to combine the complementary information obtained from HST {WFPC2 and NICMOS} archival images and OVRO millimeter array observations of protostars to obtain the best information available on the physical and dynamical properties of infalling circumstellar envelopes and the outflow-envelope interaction. The HST images of protostellar nebulae probe the dust component of the envelope, and are the best tracers of the geometry of the cavities in the envelope down to regions very close to the central source. Interferometric molecular line observations probe the gas component, which constitutes most of the mass, and provide kinematic information that directly reflects the energetics and directions of the outflows, and the distribution of the infalling gas. The information provided by these two sets of data will be analyzed consistently with scattered light models of protostellar envelopes of different geometries in which cavities due to infall and/or winds with different morphologies and strength have been carved. Only by combining the HST and OVRO data we can obtain the {unprecedented} information essential to understanding the star formation process., We plan to analyze 636 F555W and 653 F814W images of 47 Tuc taken during observation run GO-8267. We will construct an accurate main sequence CMD using all the data in an optimal way. By analyzing the results with extensive artificial star tests, we will: {1} calculate the binary frequency in the cluster, {2} calibrate the binary period distribution by comparing with the known population of short-period eclipsing binaries, {3} determine the unevolved single-star main sequence luminosity function, and {4} identify the BY Dra candidates classified by X-ray spectra and temporal characteristics {X-ray and/or optical} . The results are essential in the studies of stellar dynamics, stellar population, and origins of dynamically interesting objects. We have developed robust data reduction techniques and applied them successfully in similar HST/WFPC2 studies. If this proposal is accepted, the results obtained will form a major component of graduate student Bing Zhao's Ph.D. thesis., Helioseismic analysis of solar global oscillations allows investigation of the internal structure of the Sun. One important test of the reliability of the inferences from helioseismology is that the results from independent sets of contemporaneous data are consistent with one another. Here we compare mode frequencies from the Global Oscillation Network Group and Michelson Doppler Imager on board SOHO and resulting inversion results on the Sun's internal structure. The average relative differences between the data sets are typically less than 1×10<SUP>-5</SUP>, substantially smaller than the formal errors in the differences; however, in some cases the frequency differences show a systematic behavior that might nonetheless influence the inversion results. We find that the differences in frequencies are not a result of instrumental effects but are almost entirely related to the data pipeline software. Inversion of the frequencies shows that their differences do not result in any significant effects on the resulting inferences on solar structure. We have also experimented with fitting asymmetric profiles to the oscillation power spectra and find that, compared with the symmetric fits, this causes no significant change in the inversion results., We propose to make observations that directly test the proposition that globular clusters contain massive black holes. Our targets are the bulge globular clusters NGC 6388 and NGC 6441. These are probably among the most massive in the galaxy, but are understudied compared to more familiar objects such as M15. Our analysis suggests that these two clusters are the most likely to show unambiguous evidence for a central massive black hole if such things exist in globular clusters. The observations proposed will give us the first thorough kinematic and photometric studies of these two clusters. The combination of the two epochs will give us proper motions good to of order 6 km/s. In addition, they will provide us with the first good, deep, color-magnitude diagrams for these clusters. These diagrams will be used to investigate the make up of the stellar population in the clusters, to more firmly establish their distances, ages, and metallicities, and to search for a binary sequence., The nuclear phase/shape transition in the framework of the Interacting Boson Model is analyzed in detail and the predictions of this model are compared with the evolution of basic observables in the region Z=58-76, N=84-100., We have used quantum Monte Carlo methods to calculate microscopically level densities in large model spaces within the framework of the interacting shell model. Calculated densities for A ~ 50 - 70 nuclei are in remarkably good agreement with experimental level densities and an improvement over empirical formulas. Nevertheless, current Monte Carlo calculations are limited to temperatures below ~ 1.5 - 2 MeV. We have recently introduced a framework that accounts for the full single-particle model space (bound states plus continuum) together with interaction effects in the truncated space. We find that the backshifted Bethe formula is valid in a larger temperature range (i.e., up to ~ 4 MeV). A signature of the pairing phase transition is clearly seen in the heat capacity of even-even nuclei., Recent developments in the description of the structural evolution of nuclei invoke the concepts of phase transitions and phase coexistence. New, analytic, parameter-free symmetries have been developed that describe nuclei at the ""critical points"" of phase/shape transition regions. The entire N=90 region appears to be an example of the X(5) - spherical vibrator to axial rotor - phase transitional point. Consideration of both prolate and oblate shapes allows an extension and symmetrization of the symmetry triangle for nuclear structure., Oxygen isotope ratios of merrillite and chlorapatite in the Martian meteorites ALH84001 and Los Angeles have been measured by ion microprobe in multicollector mode. δ <SUP>18</SUP>O values of phosphate minerals measured in situ range from ∼3 to 6‰, and are similar to Martian meteorite whole-rock values, as well as the δ <SUP>18</SUP>O of igneous phosphate on Earth. These results suggest that the primary, abiotic, igneous phosphate reservoir on Mars is similar in oxygen isotopic composition to the basaltic phosphate reservoir on Earth. This is an important first step in the characterization of Martian phosphate reservoirs for the use of δ <SUP>18</SUP>O of phosphate minerals as a biomarker for life on Mars. Cumulative textural, major-element, and isotopic evidence presented here suggest a primary, igneous origin for the phosphates in Los Angeles and ALH84001; textural and chemical evidence suggests that phosphates in ALH84001 were subsequently shock-melted in a later event., Gravitational lensing has been used to successfully map the distribution of mass on a wide range of scales. I review the techniques and recent results primarily from galaxy-galaxy lensing studies in massive intermediate redshift clusters and explore the implications for the nature of dark matter., The ratio of obscured to unobscured AGN, and the evolution of that ratio with redshift, is important for understanding (1) the AGN phenomenon and (2) the production of the extragalactic X-ray and infrared ``backgrounds.'' Current models for these backgrounds predict a different evolution for obscured AGN compared to unobscured (type 1) AGN. Deep X-ray/infrared surveys like GOODS (the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey, a deep multi-wavelength survey using SIRTF, HST/ACS, Chandra, XMM, and an array of ground-based telescopes) test these models at virtually all redshifts. <P />We present the expected number of obscured and unobscured sources in several wavebands, ranging from the SIRTF 24-micron MIPS band to optical HST/ACS bands to Chandra X-ray bands, based on various plausible assumptions about their luminosity functions and evolution. These semi-theoretical predictions are compared with the observed number counts obtained from the GOODS data., According to the unification paradigm, active galaxies present a vastly different appearance depending on their orientation to the line of sight. Both relativistic beaming of the jet emission and obscuration of the central continuum and broad-line emission are important. Unification explains most observations of active galaxy spectra and number counts, once the strong selection effects are taken into account. There are still some puzzling issues, such as whether the unification model continues to hold in the early Universe, where active galaxies are most numerous. New multiwavelength surveys like GOODS will answer this question. Meanwhile, the ubiquity of supermassive black holes in local galaxies, and the correlation between their mass and the stellar dynamics, suggest a need for ``Grand Unification'' between active and normal galaxies. It seems increasingly likely that the process of bulge formation in young galaxies is tied closely to the growth of the central black hole and to the epoch of peak activity in galaxy nuclei. <P />This work has been supported by NASA., Results of a 3D radiative hydrodynamical simulation of atmospheric convection, applicable to a red giant star of one solar mass with log g = 2.6, are presented, with special emphasis on the scale of the convective cells. Since the work of Schwarzschild (1975), it has been expected, by analogy with the Sun, that convective cell size scales with the atmospheric scale height H<SUB>p</SUB> and the width of the highly superadiabatic transition layer (SAL). Based on his estimate of the SAL, Schwarzschild (1975) predicted a few hundred cells on a giant and fewer (possibly even just a few) cells on a supergiant like Betelgeuse, in contrast with the two million cells observed on the solar surface. Freytag et al (1999)'s 10H<SUB>p</SUB> scaling law, based on 2D numerical simulations, suggests a few hundred cells on a supergiant. <P />This work is an extension to a lower surface gravity of earlier 3D simulations for the Sun (Robinson et al. 2003a) and subgiant stars (Robinson et al. 2003b). Preliminary extrapolation from these simulations predicts that the surface of a giant with log g = 2.6 has approximately 40,000 cells. Betelgeuse, with log g = -0.5, would have approximately 300 cells. This number of cells is compatible with Gray's (2001) spectroscopic observations of Betelgeuse, although other observations of its surface brightness have been interpreted as due to fewer giant cells. <P />The convection scale size from the giant simulation is compared to previous extrapolations and to observation. <P />This work was supported in part by research grants from NASA (NAG5-8406), Yonsei University and NSERC of Canada., , We determine differences in the sound-speed profiles of isolated active regions and nearby quiet areas. We use frequencies of high-degree modes determined from from ring-diagram analyses for this work. We that below a certain depth, the sound-speed below an active region is higher than that of a quiet region. <P />This work is supported by NASA grant NAG5-10912., Helioseismology has proved to be an extremely powerful tool to study the structure and dynamics of the Sun. This technique also allows the Sun to be used as a laboratory to study the properties of matter. In this talk I shall discuss how we use helioseismology to study properties of matter, and what we have learned so far. In particular, I shall concentrate on neutrinos and stellar equations of state., We are measuring the long-term light curves of several Kuiper Belt Objects and Centaurs using the queue-scheduled 1.3 m telescope of the SMARTS consortium [1] at Cerro Telolo. Since February of 2002, we have measured the Johnson B, V, and I colors of (50000) Quaoar, (28978) Ixion, 2002 AW197, 2002 PN34, and 2002 GZ32 at 2-day intervals. Here we report preliminary results for Quaoar and Ixion, and compare them to our previous results for (38628) Huya = 2000 EB173 and for Nereid. <P />[1] ``Small and Moderate Aperture Research Telescop System"", http://www.astro.yale.edu/smarts, We present proper motions derived from Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) imaging for stars in the core of the peculiar globular cluster NGC 6752. The central velocity dispersion in both components of the proper motion is 12 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We discuss the implications of this result, as well as the intrinsic difficulties in making such measurements. We also give an alternative correction for the 34-row problem in the WFPC2 CCDs. <P />Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the data archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI). STScI is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555., Motivated by the recent interest in dynamical properties of topologically non-trivial spacetimes, we study linear perturbations of spatially closed Bianchi III vacuum spacetimes, whose spatial topology is the direct product of a higher genus surface and the circle. We first develop necessary mode functions, vectors and tensors, and then perform separations of (perturbation) variables. The perturbation equations decouple in a way that is similar to but a generalization of those of the Regge-Wheeler spherically symmetric case. We further achieve a decoupling of each set of perturbation equations into gauge-dependent and gauge-independent parts, by which we obtain wave equations for the gauge-invariant variables. We then discuss choices of gauge and stability properties. Details of the compactification of Bianchi III manifolds and spacetimes are presented in an appendix. In the other appendices we study scalar field and electromagnetic equations on the same background to compare asymptotic properties., Using high-resolution SPH numerical simulations, we investigate the effects of gas on the inspiral and merger of binary black hole systems. Our simulations are still in progress, but preliminary results suggest that when significant amounts of gas are present, e.g., as might be expected in the merger of two gas-rich parent galaxies, a pair of black holes will quickly sink to the center of the system and merge, i.e., gas can play a major role and prevents the hang-up of the black hole binary., Hydrogen isotope exchange between water and orthosilicic acid (H <SUB>4</SUB>SiO <SUB>4</SUB>) was modeled using B3LYP calculations and classical transition-state theory. Configurations of 1, 2, 3 and 7 water molecules and H <SUB>4</SUB>SiO <SUB>4</SUB> were used to investigate energetically viable reaction pathways. An upper-bound of 71 kJ/mol was assumed for the zero-point energy corrected barrier (ZPECB) because this is the experimentally determined activation energy for Si-O bond breaking (Rimstidt and Barnes, 1980) and ZPECB is expected to be close to this value. Long range solvation forces were accounted for using the integral equation formalism polarized continuum model (IEFPCM; Cancès et al., 1997). Primary and secondary isotope effects were computed by exchanging hydrogen atoms with deuterium. Results show that reaction mechanisms involving 3 and 7 water molecules have ZPECB of 34 to 38 kJ/mol, whereas those involving 1 and 2 water molecules have ZPECB in excess of the set upper-bound. The lower range of ZPECB with 3 or 7 water molecules is reasonable to explain rapid hydrogen isotope exchange with silicates. Rate constant calculations accounting for tunneling, anharmonicity and scaling factors indicate that the reaction is fast and equilibrium can be assumed under most geologic conditions., It is suggested that the three-segmented morphology of the soft X-ray emission from cluster and field stars may be understood in terms of the recent classification of rotating stars into three kinds: those lying on the convective sequence, on the interface sequence, or in the gap between them. <P />This is paper 14 in the WIYN Open Cluster Study., We confirm spectroscopically the existence of a population of galaxies at z&gt;~2 with rest-frame optical colors similar to normal nearby galaxies. The galaxies were identified by their red near-infrared colors in deep images obtained with the Infrared Spectrometer and Array Camera on the Very Large Telescope of the field around the foreground cluster MS 1054-03. Redshifts of six galaxies with J<SUB>s</SUB>-K<SUB>s</SUB>&gt;2.3 were measured from optical spectra obtained with the W. M. Keck telescope. Five out of six are in the range 2.43&lt;=z&lt;=3.52, demonstrating that the J<SUB>s</SUB>-K<SUB>s</SUB> color selection is quite efficient. The rest-frame ultraviolet spectra of confirmed z&gt;2 galaxies display a range of properties, with two galaxies showing emission lines characteristic of active galactic nuclei, two having Lyα in emission, and one showing interstellar absorption lines only. Their full spectral energy distributions are well described by constant star formation models with ages 1.4-2.6 Gyr, except for one galaxy whose colors indicate a dusty starburst. The confirmed z&gt;2 galaxies are very luminous: their K<SUB>s</SUB> magnitudes are in the range 19.2-19.9, corresponding to rest-frame absolute V magnitudes from -24.8 to -23.2. Assuming that our bright spectroscopic sample is representative for the general population of J<SUB>s</SUB>-K<SUB>s</SUB> selected objects, we find that the surface density of red z&gt;~2 galaxies is ~0.9 arcmin<SUP>-2</SUP> to K<SUB>s</SUB>=21. The surface density is comparable to that of Lyman break-selected galaxies with K<SUB>s</SUB>&lt;21, when corrections are made for the different redshift distributions of the two samples. Although there will be some overlap between the two populations, most ``optical-break'' galaxies are too faint in the rest-frame ultraviolet to be selected as Lyman break galaxies. The most straightforward interpretation is that star formation in typical optical-break galaxies started earlier than in typical Lyman break galaxies. Optical-break galaxies may be the oldest and most massive galaxies yet identified at z&gt;2, and they could evolve into early-type galaxies and bulges. <P />Based on service mode observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Paranal, Chile (ESO progamme 164.O-0612)., This paper describes a series of three-dimensional simulations of shallow inefficient convection in the outer layers of the Sun. The computational domain is a closed box containing the convection-radiation transition layer, located at the top of the solar convection zone. The most salient features of the simulations are that: (i) the position of the lower boundary can have a major effect on the characteristics of solar surface convection (thermal structure, kinetic energy and turbulent pressure); (ii) the width of the box has only a minor effect on the thermal structure, but a more significant effect on the dynamics (rms velocities); (iii) between the surface and a depth of 1 Mm, even though the density and pressure increase by an order of magnitude, the vertical correlation length of vertical velocity is always close to 600 km; (iv) in this region the vertical velocity cannot be scaled by the pressure or the density scaleheight; this casts doubt on the applicability of the mixing length theory, not only in the superadiabatic layer, but also in the adjacent underlying layers; (v) the final statistically steady state is not strictly dependent on the initial atmospheric stratification., Data obtained by the GONG and MDI instruments over the last 7 years are used to study how solar dynamics-both rotation and other large scale flows-has changed with time. In addition to the well-known phenomenon of bands of faster and slower rotation moving toward the equator and pole, we find that the zonal flow pattern rises upward with time. Like the zonal flows, the meridional flows also show distinct solar activity-related changes. In particular, the antisymmetric component of the meridional flow shows a decrease in speed with activity. We do not see any significant temporal variations in the dynamics of the tachocline region where the solar dynamo is believed to be operating., Seismology provides powerful tests of convection deep instellar interiors. First, the role of convective overshoot and lowefficiency convection, two areas of uncertainty with importantastrophysical implications, are reviewed briefly. In the rest of thetalk, a critical introduction to numerical simulations of radiativehydrodynamics will be given. The basic underlyingassumptions and challenges are explained, and some recent resultsare presented., The two-phase theory for compaction and damage proposed by Bercovici et al. (2001a, J. Geophys. Res.,106, 8887-8906) employs a nonequilibrium relation between interfacial surface energy, pressure and viscous deformation, thereby providing a model for damage (void generation and microcracking) and a continuum description of weakening, failure and shear localization. Here we examine further variations of the model which consider (1) how interfacial surface energy, when averaged over the mixture, appears to be partitioned between phases; (2) how variability in deformational-work partitioning greatly facilitates localization; and (3) how damage and localization are manifested in heat output and bulk energy exchange. Microphysical considerations of molecular bonding and activation energy suggest that the apparent partitioning of surface energy between phases goes as the viscosity of the phases. When such partitioning is used in the two-phase theory, it captures the melt-compaction theory of McKenzie (1984, J. Petrol.,25, 713-765) exactly, as well as the void-damage theory proposed in a companion paper (Ricard &amp; Bercovici, submitted). Calculations of 1-D shear localization with this variation of the theory still show at least three possible regimes of damage and localization: at low stress is weak localization with diffuse slowly evolving shear bands; at higher stress strong localization with narrow rapidly growing bands exists; and at yet higher shear stress it is possible for the system to undergo broadly distributed damage and no localization. However, the intensity of localization is strongly controlled by the variability of the deformational-work partitioning with dilation rate, represented by the parameter γ. For γ&gt;&gt; 1, extreme localization is allowed, with sharp profiles in porosity (weak zones), nearly discontinuous separation velocities and effectively singular dilation rates. Finally, the bulk heat output is examined for the 1-D system to discern how much deformational work is effectively stored as surface energy. In the high-stress, distributed-damage cases, heat output is reduced as more interfacial surface energy is created. Yet, in either the weak or strong localizing cases, the system always releases surface energy, regardless of the presence of damage or not, and thus slightly more heat is in fact released than energy is input through external work. Moreover, increased levels of damage (represented by the maximum work-partitioning f*) make the localizing system release surface energy faster as damage enhances phase separation and focusing of the porosity field, thus yielding more rapid loss of net interfacial surface area. However, when cases with different levels of damage are compared at similar stages of development (say, the peak porosity of the localization) it is apparent that increased damage causes smaller relative heat release and retards loss of net interfacial surface energy. The energetics and energy partitioning of this damage and shear-localization model are applied to estimating the energy costs of forming plate boundaries and generating plates from mantle convection., The Q<SUB>EC</SUB> value of <SUP>80</SUP>Y has been measured by β-γ coincidence spectroscopy to be ⩾8929(83) keV. Combining this result with the adopted mass excess of the daughter <SUP>80</SUP>Sr gives a mass excess for <SUP>80</SUP>Y of ⩾-61 376(83) keV. Results are compared with other measurements, with Audi-Wapstra systematics, and with predictions of mass formulas. Implications of this measurement are considered for the rp process., We have measured the absolute proper motions of four low-latitude, inner Galaxy globular clusters. These clusters are NGC 6266 (M62), NGC 6304, NGC 6316, and NGC 6723. The proper motions are on the Hipparcos system, since no background extragalactic objects are found in these high-extinction regions. The proper-motion uncertainties range between 0.3 and 0.6 mas yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. We discuss the kinematics of these clusters and of three additional bulge clusters-NGC 6522, NGC 6528, and NGC 6553-whose proper motions with respect to bulge stars had been determined previously. We find that all of the clusters have velocities that confine them to the bulge region. Of the three metal-poor clusters ([Fe/H]&lt;-1.0), NGC 6522, and NGC 6723 have kinematics consistent with halo membership. The third cluster, NGC 6266 however, appears to belong to a rotationally supported system. Of the four metal-rich clusters ([Fe/H]&gt;=-1.0), NGC 6304 and NGC 6553 also have kinematics consistent with membership to a rotationally supported system. NGC 6528 has kinematics, metallicity, and mass that argue in favor of a genuine Milky Way bar cluster. NGC 6316's kinematics indicate membership to a hotter system than the bar., There are now fully six classes of pulsators among white dwarfsand their immediate precursors among central stars of planetarynebulae and on the extended horizontal branch.In this review, we outline those observational and theoreticalconsiderations that link them together and set them apart fromother kinds of pulsating stars.We summarize some select astrophysical puzzles to which studiesof such pulsators might speak, and we discuss current applicationsin the fields of atomic, nuclear, and neutrino physics.Finally, we suggest how future observing programs might solve somegeneral problems common not only to the white dwarf and pre-whitedwarf pulsators but to many types of variable stars., Inversions of oscillation frequencies have proved to be extremelypowerful in studying the structure of the Sun. We examine theconditions under which we can invert oscillation frequenciesof other stars to study their structure. We show that despite thevery limited number of modes that are expected to be observed in otherstars, we can perform inversions that will give localized informationof the stellar core. These results can limit the space of admissiblemodels of a given star., The dissolution rate and mechanism of three different cleavage faces of a dolomite crystal from Navarra (near Pamplona), Spain, were studied in detail by vertical scanning interferometry techniques. A total of 37 different regions (each about 124 × 156 μm in size) on the three sample surfaces were monitored as a function of time during dissolution at 25°C and pH 3. Dissolution produced shallow etch pits with widths reaching 20 μm during 8 h of dissolution. Depth development as a function of time was remarkably similar for all etch pits on a given dolomite surface. On the basis of etch pit distribution and volume as a function of time, the calculated dissolution rate increases from near zero to 4 × 10 <SUP>-11</SUP> mol cm <SUP>-2</SUP> s <SUP>-1</SUP> over 5 h. The time variation is different for each of the three cleavage surfaces studied. In addition, the absolute dissolution rates of different parts of the dolomite crystal surface can be computed by using a reference surface. The different surfaces yield an ""average"" rate of 1.08 × 10 <SUP>-11</SUP> mol cm <SUP>-2</SUP> s <SUP>-1</SUP> with a standard deviation of 0.3 × 10 <SUP>-11</SUP> mol cm <SUP>-2</SUP> s <SUP>-1</SUP> based on about 60 analyses. The mean absolute rate of the dolomite surface is about 10 times slower than the rate calculated from etch pit dissolution alone. On the other hand, earlier batch rate data that used BET surface areas yield rates that are at least 30 to 60 times faster than our directly measured mean dissolution rate for the same pH and temperature. A conceptual model for mineral dissolution has been inferred from the surface topography obtained by the interferometry investigations. In this model, mineral dissolution is not dominated by etch pit formation itself but rather by extensive dissolution stepwaves that originate at the outskirts of the etch pits. These stepwaves control the overall dissolution as well as the dependence on temperature and saturation state., We propose a simple interpretation of the rotation period data for solar- and late-type stars. The open cluster and Mount Wilson star observations suggest that rotating stars lie primarily on two sequences, initially called I and C. Some stars lie in the intervening gap. These sequences, and the fractional numbers of stars on each sequence, evolve systematically with cluster age, enabling us to construct crude rotational isochrones allowing ``stellar gyrochronology,'' a procedure, on improvement, likely to yield ages for individual field stars. The age and color dependences of the sequences allow the identification of the underlying mechanism, which appears to be primarily magnetic. The majority of solar- and late-type stars possess a dominant Sun-like, or interface, magnetic field, which connects the convective envelope to both the radiative interior of the star and the exterior, where winds can drain off angular momentum. These stars spin down Skumanich style. An age-decreasing fraction of young G, K, and M stars, which are rapid rotators, possess only a convective field, which is not only inefficient in depleting angular momentum but also incapable of coupling the surface convection zone to the inner radiative zone, so that only the outer zone is spun down, and on an exponential timescale. These stars do not yet possess large-scale dynamos. The large-scale magnetic field associated with the dynamo, apparently created by the shear between the decoupled radiative and convective zones, (re)couples the convective and radiative zones and drives a star from the convective to the interface sequence through the gap on a timescale that increases as stellar mass decreases. Fully convective stars do not possess such an interface, cannot generate an interface dynamo, and hence can never make such a transition. Helioseismic results for the present-day Sun agree with this scheme, which also explains the rotational bimodality observed by Herbst and collaborators among pre-main-sequence stars and the termination of this bimodality when stars become fully convective. This paradigm also provides a new basis for understanding stellar X-ray and chromospheric activity, light-element abundances, and perhaps other stellar phenomena that depend on rotation. <P />This is Paper 13 of the WIYN Open Cluster Study (WOCS)., Using Yale stellar evolution models, we present an analysis of the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of three intermediate-age LMC clusters, namely, NGC 2173, SL 556, and NGC 2155, obtained with the Very Large Telescope. The main goal of our project is to investigate the amount of convective core overshoot necessary to reproduce the CMDs of relatively metal-poor, intermediate-age stellar populations, to check whether the extrapolation that is usually made from solar metallicity is valid. In the process, we obtained values for the binary fraction of each cluster, together with refined age estimates. Our method involved the comparison of the observed CMDs with synthetic CMDs computed using various values of the overshoot parameter and binary fraction. We conclude that a moderate amount of overshoot and some fraction of binary stars are essential for reproducing the observed shapes around the turnoff in the CMDs of all three clusters: unresolved binary stars fill in the expected core contraction gap and make a unique sequence near the gap, which cannot be reproduced by single stars alone, even with a larger amount of overshoot. We utilize ratios of the number of stars in different areas around the core contraction gap to constrain the binary fraction, which is around 10%-20% (for primary-to-secondary mass ratio &gt;=0.7) in all three clusters. Even if binary stars contaminate the core contraction gap, it is shown that the overshoot parameter can be inferred from the color dispersion of the stars around the contraction gap, regardless of the assumed binary fraction. From our overall analysis such as shape of isochrones, star counts, color distribution, and synthetic CMD comparisons, we conclude that overshoot ~20% of the local pressure scale height best reproduces the CMD properties of all three clusters. The best age estimates are 1.5, 2.1, and 2.9 Gyr for NGC 2173, SL 556, and NGC 2155, respectively. <P />Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Paranal, Chile (ESO 64.L-0385)., Sex (genetic exchange) is a nearly universal phenomenon in biological populations. But this is surprising given the costs associated with sex. For example, sex tends to break apart co-adapted genes, and sex causes a female to inefficiently contribute only half the genes to her offspring. Why then did sex evolve? One famous model poses that sex evolved to combat Muller's ratchet, the mutational load that accrues when harmful mutations drift to high frequencies in populations of small size. In contrast, the Fisher-Muller Hypothesis predicts that sex evolved to promote genetic variation that speeds adaptation in novel environments. Sexual mechanisms occur in viruses, which feature high rates of deleterious mutation and frequent exposure to novel or changing environments. Thus, confirmation of one or both hypotheses would shed light on the selective advantages of virus sex. Experimental evolution has been used to test these classic models in the RNA bacteriophage φ6, a virus that experiences sex via reassortment of its chromosomal segments. Empirical data suggest that sex might have originated in φ6 to assist in purging deleterious mutations from the genome. However, results do not support the idea that sex evolved because it provides beneficial variation in novel environments. Rather, experiments show that too much sex can be bad for φ6 promiscuity allows selfish viruses to evolve and spread their inferior genes to subsequent generations. Here I discuss various explanations for the evolution of segmentation in RNA viruses, and the added cost of sex when large numbers of viruses co-infect the same cell., We are developing superconducting direct detectors for submillimeter astronomy that can in principle detect individual photons. These devices, Single Quasiparticle Photon Counter (SQPC), operate by measuring the quasiparticles generated when single Cooper-pairs are broken by absorption of a submillimeter photon. This photoconductive type of device could yield high quantum efficiency, large responsivity, microsecond response times, and sensitivities in the range of 10<SUP>-20</SUP> Watts per root Hertz. The use of antenna coupling to a small absorber also suggests the potential for novel instrument designs and scalability to imaging or spectroscopic arrays. We will describe the device concept, recent results on fabrication and electrical characterization of these detectors, issues related to saturation and optimization of the device parameters. Finally, we have developed practical readout amplifiers for these high-impedance cryogenic detectors based on the Radio-Frequency Single-Electron Transistor (RF-SET). We will describe results of a demonstration of a transimpedance amplifier based on closed-loop operation of an RF-SET, and a demonstration of a wavelength-division multiplexing scheme for the RF-SET. These developments will be a key ingredient in scaling to large arrays of high-sensitivity detectors., This is the first of a series of three papers devoted to the calibration of a few parameters of crucial importance in the modeling of the evolution of intermediate-mass stars, giving special attention to the amount of convective core overshoot. To this end we acquired deep V and R photometry for three globular clusters of the Large Magellanic Cloud, namely, NGC 2173, SL 556, and NGC 2155, in the age interval 1-3 Gyr. In this first paper, we describe the aim of the project and Very Large Telescope observations and data reduction and we make preliminary comparisons of the color-magnitude diagrams with both the Padova and Yonsei-Yale isochrones. Two following papers in this series present the results of a detailed analysis of these data, independently carried out by members of the Yale and Padova stellar evolution groups. This allows us to compare both sets of models and discuss their main differences, as well as the systematic effects that they would have on the determination of the ages and metallicities of intermediate-age single-stellar populations. <P />Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Paranal, Chile (ESO 64.L-0385)., We present a numerical study of the drag on protostars in a gaseous medium. Our work investigates the evolution of a binary (equal mass) protostar in an isothermal gas for different M<SUB>binary</SUB>/M<SUB>gas</SUB> ratios. In this work we used the public Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code called GADGET (Springel, Yoshida, &amp; White 2001). We find that the gravitational drag timescales are comparable with those of the star formation process. Hence, the drag can play an important role in the formation of stars and to determine the final separation of binaries., , Errors were made in the calculations of radio-loudness upper limits in Figure 1. A corrected figure is given below. These errors do not affect any of the conclusions of the Letter., We present our simultaneous optical and IR observations of black-hole X-ray binary 4U 1543-47. Observations were obtained by the YALO consortium during 2002 when 4U 1543-47 experienced an X-ray outburst. Our observations almost fully cover the X-ray outburst rise and decline. The most interesting feature of the data is a secondary outburst in the optical and IR light curves with no corresponding rise in the ASM X-ray light curve. A radio detection was made at the peak of the secondary outburst. <P />A possible source of this optical/IR reflare is synchrotron radiation emitted from a jet. We explore this hypothesis in this poster and compare our results to another black-hole candidate with similar behaviour XTE J1550-564. We also discuss our results in the context of AGN where optical/IR emission from jet synchrotron radiation has been reported., We discuss the first part of a survey for RR Lyrae variables in the galactic halo that is being made with the 1m Schmidt telescope at the Venezuelan National Observatory. So far the survey has discovered 497 variables in 380 deg<SUP>2</SUP>, lying from 4 to 60 kpc from the Sun. It has detected three statistically significant clumps of variables, which shows that outer halo does not have smooth density contours. One clump is located at 50 kpc from the galactic center, and it is probably tidal debris from the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy. A second structure, at 17 kpc from the galactic center, appears to be due to the tidal disruption of the globular cluster Pal 5. The third group, at 19 kpc, is not related with any known globular cluster or dwarf galaxy. The little that is known about its properties is consistent with it being debris from a disrupted galaxy. <P />Based on observations at the Observatorio Nacional de Llano del Hato, Venezuela, Reactions through resonances in 19Ne are thought to be important participants in explosive stellar environments. In x-ray bursters, 15O(alpha,gamma) has been suggested as a possible pathway out of the hotCNO ""bottleneck"" to processes that generate more energy. At the lower temperatures and densities in novae, in particular oxygen-neon novae, 18F(p,gamma) and 18F(p,alpha) play a role that is important in gamma-ray astronomy. The amount of 18 F remaining in a nova's expanding envelope of ashes depends sensitively on the rates of these two reactions. It is difficult to directly measure astrophysical reaction rates, even at the relatively high energies of novae (∼500 keV) and x-ray bursters (∼1--2 MeV). For the reactions considered here, the participant nuclei are radioactive, creating more challenges. At the Wright Nuclear Structure Laboratory, indirect methods are employed for measuring astrophysical reaction rates. Nuclei are populated through alternate reactions, and the properties of their states are measured. For this study, 19Ne was populated via the 19F(3He,t) reaction with a 25 MeV 3He beam incident on 80 mug/cm2 of CaF2, deposited on 10 mug/cm2 of carbon. A large area segmented silicon array, the Yale LampShade Array (YLSA), was assembled for the purpose of measuring proton- and alpha-decays from astrophysically relevant states in 19Ne. The reaction rates are linearly dependent on the branching ratios to these channels. YLSA detected the decay particles at backward lab angles in coincidence with tritons at theta = 0°. Angular distributions were fit to the coincidence data, and integrated in order to determine branching ratios to the proton and alpha channels. These results were compared to similar efforts to measure branching ratios using different reactions and techniques, and also to a previous ( 3He,t) effort that used different instruments. In addition to standard statistical methods, a Bayesian technique was employed for averaging the data due to the physical constraints on allowed values., As part of a wide-field CCD survey of the globular cluster systems of distant giant galaxies, we have observed a total of nine spiral galaxies in three broadband filters with the WIYN 3.5-m telescope. Here I present a description of the overall survey, discuss the status of the observations, give the results for the first spiral galaxy completed, and briefly address implications for galaxy formation models., We consider the most general vacuum cylindrical spacetimes, which are defined by two global, spacelike, commuting, non-hypersurface-orthogonal Killing vector fields. The cylindrical waves in such spacetimes contain both + and × polarizations, and are thus said to be unpolarized. We show that there are no trapped cylinders in the spacetime, and present a formal derivation of Thorne's C-energy, based on a Hamiltonian reduction approach. Using the Brown-York quasilocal energy prescription, we compute the actual physical energy (per unit Killing length) of the system, which corresponds to the value of the Hamiltonian that generates unit proper-time translations orthogonal to a given fixed spatial boundary. The C-energy turns out to be a monotonic non-polynomial function of the Brown-York quasilocal energy. Finally, we show that the Brown-York energy at spatial infinity is related to an asymptotic deficit angle in exactly the same manner as the specific mass of a straight cosmic string is to the former., Quasars are among the brightest and most distant objects known, making them intrinsically interesting as well as ideal probes of the history of the universe. Over 23,000 quasars have been found since their discovery four decades ago, but most were identified by various redshift-limited ultraviolet excess methods which excluded extended sources. This prohibits the use of the global quasar sample in a statistical manner for quasar lensing studies. To improve on this situation, the QUEST survey was born, with the goal of finding large numbers of quasars and gravitational lenses using a uniform selection method for cosmology studies. To date, we have completed three years of driftscan imaging observations using the QUEST 16 CCD camera on the 1m Schmidt telescope at Llano del Hato in Venezuela. Presented here are descriptions of the equipment, data, software and selection methods used, our discovered quasar candidates, a list of confirmed quasars, measured quasar surface densities and comparisons with published results. Ten nights of UBUV filter data covering 155 square degrees are analyzed using the traditional UV-excess color-selection method to find low-redshift quasars. From the candidates where we obtained spectroscopy, we measured a low-redshift quasar surface density of 5 +/- 1 per square degree to a B magnitude limit of 19.4. Twenty-five nights of RBRV data taken over three years and covering 250 square degrees are analyzed to find quasars by their variability. To our knowledge the variability portion of our survey is the largest of its kind, using over a dozen nights fully covering most of the huge survey area. Because variability can be used to find quasars uniformly over all redshifts and extended or close groupings of objects are properly treated by our survey, the results here may be less biased with respect to lensed quasars than other selection methods. From the variability candidates where we obtained spectroscopy, we measured a quasar surface density of 42 +/- 10 per square degree to an R magnitude limit of 20.3., We present the Calán-Yale Deep Extragalactic Research (CYDER) Survey. The broad goals of the survey are the study of stellar populations, the star formation history of the universe and the formation and evolution of galaxies. The fields studied include Chandra deep pointings in order to characterize the X-ray faint populations. Here we present the results on the first fields studied. We find that the redshift distribution is consistent with that found in the Chandra Deep Field North. The distribution of hardness ratios is, however, softer in our sample. We find a high redshift quasar, CXOCY J125304.0-090737 at z=4.179, which suggests that the abundance of low luminosity high redshift quasars may be larger than what would be expected from reasonable extrapolations from the quasar optical luminosity function., We study the galaxy star formation rate (SFR) as a function of environment using the SDSS EDR data. We find that the SFR is depressed in dense environments (clusters and groups) compared to the field. We find that the suppression of the SFR starts to be noticeable at around 4 virial radii. We find no evidence for SF triggering as galaxies fall into the clusters. We also present a project to study these effects in cluster pairs systems where the effects of filaments and large scale structure may be noticeable., In the last decade, significant progress has been made toward understanding how plate tectonics is generated from mantle dynamics. A primary goal of plate-generation studies has been the development of models that allow the top cold thermal boundary layer of mantle convection, i.e. the lithosphere, to develop broad and strong plate-like segments separated by narrow, weak and rapidly deforming boundaries; ideally, such models also permit significant strike-slip (toroidal) motion, passive ridges (i.e. pulled rather than pried apart), and self-consistent initiation of subduction. A major outcome of work so far is that nearly all aspects of plate generation require lithospheric rheologies and shear-localizing feedback mechanisms that are considerably more exotic than rheologies typically used in simple fluid-dynamical models of mantle flow. The search for plate-generating behavior has taken us through investigations of the effects of shear weakening ('stick-slip') and viscoplastic rheologies, of melting at ridges and low-viscosity asthenospheres, and of grain-size dependent rheologies and damage mechanics. Many such mechanisms, either by themselves or in combination, have led to self-consistent fluid-mechanical models of mantle flow that are remarkably plate-like, which is in itself a major accomplishment. However, many other important problems remain unsolved, such as subduction intiation and asymmetry, temporal evolution of plate geometry, rapid changes in plate motion, and the Archaean initiation of the plate-tectonic mode of convection. This paper presents a brief review of progress made in the plate-generation problem over the last decade, and discusses unresolved issues and future directions of research in this important area., We present realistic simulations of galaxies in the GOODS fields, especially AGN host galaxies, to determine the accuracy with which host galaxy properties can be measured through multi-color HST ACS images. In particular, we study the effect of dilution when galaxies are observed at increasing distance. Spatial resolution might bias the detection of emission from the central source (AGN) or its surrounding star formation regions, and the accuracy with which we can measure the host morphological and structural parameters. In extreme cases, the AGN contribution may completely dominate the total emission coming from a galaxy or on the other hand, a faint/partly obscured AGN can be completely dominated by the host disk emission. We simulate host galaxies of various spectral types and luminosities, to investigate the effects of limited spatial resolution on the observed AGN/starburst/host galaxy dominance and the accuracy with which we can recover the AGN host characteristics, with various fitting routines of these synthetic images., There is growing evidence that the formation of galaxies and the growth of central black holes must be closely related. This ``grand unification'' of AGN and galaxies can be tested through studies of the AGN host galaxies. Using the deep multi-color HST ACS imaging data, we describe the morphologies of AGN host galaxies in the GOODS (Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey) southern field, which coincides with the Chandra Deep Field - South. We compare these to the morphologies of normal galaxies at the same (photometric) redshifts, also taken from the GOODS ACS data. Ground-based imaging data were taken at ESO 2.2m, NTT, VLT, and NOAO 4m telescopes and made publicly available. This work is supported by NASA., The scale of photospheric convection in red giants is generally associated, by analogy with the Sun, with the atmospheric pressure scale height and the thickness of the superadiabatic transition layer. As pointed out by Schwarzschild (1975), both of these quantities are relatively much larger in terms of the stellar radius in a red giant than in the Sun. On these grounds, Schwarzschild concluded that only a few cells must be present on a red giant surface, in contrast with two millions cells observed on the solar surface. Observations of brightness variations in the TiO band on Betelgeuse (Gaustad 1986) and direct imaging of Betelgeuse (Gilliland &amp; Dupree 1996) with HST have yielded results that are compatible with giant cells, although other interpretations (e.g. pulsation) are possible. 2D numerical simulations (Freytag et al. 2001) also claim compatibility with the giant cell interpretation. On the other hand, Gray (2001) has pointed out that his extensive spectroscopic observations of Betelgeuse are more easily interpreted in terms of many convection cells per hemisphere. We present preliminary results of 3D radiative hydrodynamical simulations which corroborate Gray's interpretation. This work is supported in part by NASA grant NAG5-8406, In the standard unified model, BL Lacs are believed to be low-luminosity FR-1 radio galaxies viewed at small angles to their jet axes. However, the relationship between high-energy peaked BL Lacs (HBLs) and low-energy peaked BL Lacs (LBLs) is still unclear. Studying BL Lacs with VLBI techniques is promising because the properties of their parsec-scale jets are strongly dependent on the orientation and Lorentz factor of the jet. Due to their relative radio-faintness, HBLs have not been as well studied on VLBI scales as LBLs. We present results of a 2-epoch VLBI survey of 12 HBLs, the first search for proper motion in the parsec-scale radio jets of HBLs. Based on the measured positions of jet components in two epochs, velocities are consistent with no motion, but we are able to place upper limits of approximately 2c on the apparent motions. We present these results and their implications for the HBL jet orientation angles and Lorentz factors, important parameters in BL Lac unification models. This research was carried out as part of the NSF's Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the NRAO in Socorro, New Mexico., Globular clusters (GCs) are valuable probes of the formation history of galaxies. Their ages, metallicities, spatial distributions, and dynamical properties serve as an observable fossil record of the conditions present in a galaxy at the time of their formation. Studying the entire ensemble of GCs around a galaxy provides important clues regarding its early history and subsequent evolution. We have undertaken a survey of the GC systems of a large sample of elliptical and spiral galaxies, with the goal of testing models for elliptical galaxy formation. The survey combines wide-field, high-resolution ground-based CCD imaging with archival Hubble Space Telescope data to determine the total numbers, spatial distributions and color distributions of GCs around the galaxies. We use photometry in three colors and image analysis to reduce the level of contamination in our lists of GC candidates. As a result, the lists are at least an order of magnitude less contaminated than previous studies. Furthermore, we typically have radial coverage to more than twice the distance of past work. The results test specific predictions of models for the origin of ellipticals (e.g., spiral-spiral mergers, dissipational collapse) and constrain future work in that area. Here I present the results of the analysis to date from what is currently the largest wide-field survey of extragalactic GC systems. This work was funded by a NASA Graduate Student Researchers Program Fellowship., We revisit the issue of whether radio loudness in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is associated with central black hole mass, as has been suggested in the literature. We present new estimates of black hole mass for 295 AGNs (mostly radio quiet), calculating their radio loudnesses from published radio and optical fluxes, and combine with our previously published values, for a sample of 452 AGNs for which both black hole mass and radio loudness (or upper limits thereto) are known. Among the radio-quiet AGNs, there are now many black holes with mass larger than 10<SUP>9</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>, extending to the same high black hole masses as radio-loud AGNs of the same redshifts. Over the full sample, the black hole masses of radio-loud and radio-quiet AGNs span the same large range, 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>. We conclude that radio loudness in AGNs does not depend strongly on central black hole mass., This paper is the last in a series investigating the optical properties of a sample of mid-IR warm Seyfert galaxies and of a control sample of mid-IR cold galaxies. In the present paper I parametrize the morphologies and interaction properties of the host galaxies and combine these with the major conclusions in my previous papers. My results confirm that nuclear activity is linked to galactic interactions. I suggest an alternative view to the simple orientation-obscuration model postulated for Seyfert types 1 and 2 that takes into account the time evolution of their environmental and morphological properties. Within this view, the distinction between warm Seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies is not one of simple orientation; the latter might instead represent an earlier evolutionary stage, with properties intermediate between the (starburst-dominated) cold galaxies and the (AGN-dominated) warm Seyfert 1 galaxies., We revisit the issue of whether radio loudness in AGN is associated with central black hole mass, as has been suggested in the literature. We made new estimates of black hole mass for 281 AGN (mostly radio-quiet), calculated their radio loudnesses from published radio and optical fluxes, and combined with our previously published values, for a sample of 157 AGN for which both black hole mass and radio loudness are known. Among the radio-quiet AGN, there are now many black holes with mass larger than 10<SUP>9</SUP> M<SUB>sun</SUB>. We find no intrinsic difference between the distributions of black hole mass for radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN with M<SUB>BH</SUB> &gt; 10<SUP>9</SUP> M<SUB>sun</SUB>. We conclude that radio loudness in AGN does not depend strongly on their central black hole mass., The oxygen isotopic compositions of silica and SiO2-rich glass have been measured in situ by ion microprobe in the Martian meteorite ALH84001. Two different textural occurrences, a large anhedral (40x60æm) partially crystalline silica grain and a SiO2-rich glass-rich region of a granular band, have been studied. The large silica grain has been studied by electron microprobe [1] and micro-Raman spectroscopy [2] and is found to be compositionally similar to the fine-grained SiO2-rich regions in the granular band [1]. The SiO2-rich glass is finely intergrown with carbonate (of limited compositional range), chromite, feldspar and orthopyroxene. 18O/16O ratios were measured using the UCLA ims 1270 ion microprobe in multicollector mode using quartz mineral standards. Three analyses of the large silica grain in 2 analytical sessions gave a small range in oxygen isotopes (d18O=+24.41+/-0.80per mil to +25.3+/-2.6per mil; 2s); a similar range was measured for four regions of SiO2-rich glass in the granular band (d18O=+22.37+/-0.38per mil to +24.08+/-0.58 per mil; 2s). Our data show a limited range in d18O of silica which is in contrast to the large range found for ALH84001 carbonates (d18O: -10 to +28per mil [3-7]) and no evidence of low d18O values that would be indicative of magmatic or high-temperature silica [8]. Our results are heavier (by 2-4per mil) than a value published by [3] probably reflecting our more accurate correction for instrumental mass fractionation. The similar diffusivities for oxygen in calcite and quartz suggest that carbonate was deposited over a wide temperature range but that silica precipitated over a limited temperature interval. In the granular band, silica and carbonate appear to have been co-precipitated, potentially providing an opportunity to constrain the temperature and oxygen isotopic composition of the formation water for these two phases. The carbonate is too fine-grained for ion probe isotopic analysis, however the well-defined correlation of major-element and oxygen isotope compositions of ALH84001 carbonate [3-6] could be used to constrain its oxygen isotope composition. Electron microprobe analyses are in progress and will be reported at the meeting. These data should provide our best proxy for the oxygen isotope composition of water on early Mars. Implications for the search for life using the stable isotopes of oxygen will be discussed., Of the five key light stable isotope biomarkers, C, H, O, N and S, oxygen has received relatively limited application to the search for life and previous oxygen isotope studies of extraterrestrial materials have often focused on oxygen in carbonates and silicates. This is due, in part, to the limited study and development of other oxygen isotope ratio systems relevant to biological activity (e.g., phosphate, sulfate, nitrate) specifically for application to the search for extraterrestrial life. An overview of oxygen isotope biomarker systematics will be presented with emphasis on development of O isotope ratios of phosphate as a new biomarker in the search for life on Mars and Europa. Phosphate is central to life on Earth and has been widely recognized and applied as a biomarker molecule in the form of phosphate minerals, in studies of ancient life on Earth. The lack of multiple stable isotopes of P precludes direct stable isotope ratio studies of P, however, itÂ­A~\x9Ds occurrence as predominantly orthophosphate, PO<SUB>4</SUB>, permits the use of oxygen isotope ratios of PO<SUB>4</SUB> to trace enzymatic reactions and biological cycling of P in natural environments. The unique chemical properties of PO<SUB>4</SUB> also make δ<SUP>18</SUP>O values of inorganic environmental PO<SUB>4</SUB> (e.g., PO<SUB>4</SUB> in soils, rocks; dissolved PO<SUB>4</SUB>) an ideal signature of the presence of both extant and extinct biological (enzymatic) activity as well as hydrothermal activity. Fundamental processes underlying the recording of biological signals in oxygen isotope ratios of environmental phosphate and development and application of δ<SUP>18</SUP>O<SUB>P</SUB> as a biomarker for Mars will be discussed, including characterization of δ<SUP>18</SUP>O<SUB>P</SUB> signatures of key Martian PO<SUB>4</SUB> source reservoirs by analysis of Martian meteorites, and consideration of the co-evolution of δ<SUP>18</SUP>O<SUB>P</SUB> signatures with life on Mars and in terrestrial analogue systems., I will review the expectations for optical/IR lightcurves from the outbursts of soft X-ray transients that arise from theory and previous observation. I then compare these expectations with recent data from the YALO project, which has provided daily OIR observations for a number of sources in outburst. I conclude that a) whenever data are available, the OIR outburst precedes the start of the X-ray outburst by about a week - OIR monitoring thus provides an excellent trigger for X-ray outbursts; 2) there are a wide variety of OIR outburst morphologies, many of which have no correlation with the X-ray flux - thus it appears that effects beyond simple disk instabilities and X-ray irradiation must be invoked to explain the OIR flux; c) a new kind of outburst, dominated by IR flux, with no apparent X-ray response in the RXTE/ASM, has been observed in two sources - in both cases these IR-dominated events have significant radio flux, and thus may be related to jet activity. If so, the IR could be used as a trigger for radio observations. Finally, I will present our plans for more such monitoring over the next few years., It is important to examine stellar parameters jointly—for example, stellar masses vs. luminosities, stellar luminosities vs. surface temperatures, etc. But comparisons between masses and parameters inferred from photometry, such as luminosities and temperatures, have been limited. This is because masses can be directly measured only for the components of binary and multiple star systems; but, until recently, it has been difficult to measure the individual magnitudes of most of these components. This dissertation addresses the problem of acquiring accurate binary star photometry, and explores some initial results involving the luminosities and temperatures deduced from recent photometric measures. It focuses on binaries with the highest-quality visual orbits, and therefore on stars with generally the most precise masses. Of these binaries, the Yale-RIT binary star group has measured 521 differential magnitudes through the end of 2000. These measures are presented herein, with uncertainties, in both the original and the Johnson photometric systems. This dissertation also introduces a new method for calculating the effective temperatures and absolute magnitudes of binary star components, by fitting spectra to observed total and differential photometry. The method requires a minimum of assumptions, is statistically rigorous, and allows all available photometric data to be combined to potentially yield very precise parameter estimates. This method is applied to the Yale-RIT differential measures, in combination with other photometry from the literature, to yield the temperatures and absolute magnitudes of nine binaries. The implications of these results, such as their compatibility with stellar evolution models, are discussed. Also described are instrumentation and techniques that will improve binary star temperature and luminosity estimates, such as the new RIT-Yale Tip-tilt Speckle Imager (RYTSI), and SIM, the space mission that will measure very precise parallaxes., If the high-energy emission from TeV blazars is produced by the Synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC) mechanism, then simultaneous X-ray and gamma-ray observations of these objects are a powerful probe of the electron (and positron) populations responsible for this emission. Understanding the emitting particle distributions and their temporal evolution in turn allows us to probe physical conditions in the inner blazar jet and test, for example, various acceleration scenarios. Furthermore, by constraining the SSC model parameters, such observations enable us to predict the intrinsic (unabsorbed) gamma-ray energy spectra of these sources, a major uncertainty in current attempts to use gamma-ray observations to constrain the intensity of the Diffuse Extragalactic Background Radiation (DEBRA) at optical/infrared wavelengths. As a next step in testing the SSC model and as a demonstration of the potential power of coordinated X-ray and gamma-ray observations, we model in detail the X-ray and gamma-ray light curves of the TeV blazar Mrk 501 during its 1997 April-May outburst with a time-dependent SSC model. Extensive, quasi-simultaneous X-ray and gamma-ray coverage exists for this period. We discuss and explore quantitatively several of the flare scenarios presented in the literature. We show that simple two-component models (with a soft, steady X-ray component plus a variable SSC component) involving substantial pre-acceleration of electrons to Lorentz factors on the order of γ<SUB>min</SUB>= 10<SUP>5</SUP> describe the data train surprisingly well. All considered models imply an emission region that is strongly out of equipartition and low radiative efficiencies (ratio between kinetic jet luminosity and comoving radiative luminosity) of 1 per-mill and less. Degeneracy in both, model variant and jet parameters, prevents us from using the time-resolved SSC calculations to tighten substantially the constraints on the amount of extragalactic gamma-ray extinction by the DEBRA in the relevant 0.5-50 μm wavelength range, compared with earlier work., In this Letter, we present the results of our study of galaxy-galaxy lensing in massive cluster lenses spanning z=0.17-0.58, utilizing high-quality archival Hubble Space Telescope data. Local anisotropies in the shear maps are assumed to arise from dark matter substructure within these clusters. Associating the substructure with bright early-type cluster galaxies, we quantify the properties of typical L<SUP>*</SUP> cluster members in a statistical fashion. The fraction of total mass associated with individual galaxies within the inner regions of these clusters ranges from 10% to 20%, implying that the bulk of the dark matter in massive lensing clusters is smoothly distributed. Looking at the properties of the cluster galaxies, we find strong evidence (&gt;3 σ significance) that a fiducial early-type L<SUP>*</SUP> galaxy in these clusters has a mass distribution that is tidally truncated compared with equivalent luminosity galaxies in the field. In fact, we exclude field galaxy scale dark halos for these cluster early types at greater than 10 σ significance. We compare the tidal radii obtained from this lensing analysis with the central density of the cluster potentials and find a correlation that is in excellent agreement with theoretical expectations of tidal truncation: logr<SUP>*</SUP><SUB>t</SUB>~(-0.6+/-0.2)logρ<SUB>0</SUB>., The detailed distribution of mass within clusters of galaxies can be used to probe the nature of dark matter. We show that constraints on the extent of the mass distribution around galaxies in the rich cluster A2218 obtained from combining strong and weak lensing observations are consistent with the predictions that assume that the dominant mass component (dark matter) in these halos is collisionless. A strongly interacting (fluid-like) dark matter is ruled out at a confidence level of more than 5 σ., Supply of Os to the oceans via atmospheric transport is assessed by means of aerosol analyses and tracking with <SUP>210</SUP>Pb. Although the inferred continental Os flux at a coastal site (New Haven, Connecticut) was found to be large, this flux is not representative of the global atmospheric flux to the oceans. This conclusion is based on the observed <SUP>210</SUP>Pb atmospheric flux pattern across the Pacific Ocean and the constancy of the <SUP>187</SUP>Os/<SUP>188</SUP>Os in the oceans. The <SUP>210</SUP>Pb-based flux of Os to Pacific islands based on a measure of the leachable Os in stream sediments and the measured Al flux to these islands is assessed. By means of this approach, 0.8 mol of Os per year of atmospherically transported Os to the world oceans is obtained. This value is considerably smaller than the value of ∼1500 mol of Os per year assigned to delivery by streams. However, there may be an additional flux of Os to the oceans from the release from coastal aerosols, although the amount is uncertain., Line profiles of emission lines provides a wealth of information about a binary system such as the velocity and location of emitting line regions and the structure of the accretion disk. Hence, it is a valuable piece of the puzzle in understanding X-ray binaries. <P />I will present data obtained on GX 339-4 during the high and low states in 1998 and 1999, respectively. The line profile behaviour is rich and varied and raises many questions about the sources of the optical emission lines and how the X-rays may be affecting such emission., Black hole mass, along with mass accretion rate, is a fundamental property of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Black hole mass sets an approximate upper limit to AGN energetics via the Eddington limit. We collect and compare all AGN black hole mass estimates from the literature; these 177 masses are mostly based on the virial assumption for the broad emission lines, with the broad-line region size determined from either reverberation mapping or optical luminosity. We introduce 200 additional black hole mass estimates based on properties of the host galaxy bulges, using either the observed stellar velocity dispersion or the fundamental plane relation to infer σ these methods assume that AGN hosts are normal galaxies. We compare 36 cases for which black hole mass has been generated by different methods and find, for individual objects, a scatter as high as a couple of orders of magnitude. The less direct the method, the larger the discrepancy with other estimates, probably due to the large scatter in the underlying correlations assumed. Using published fluxes, we calculate bolometric luminosities for 234 AGNs and investigate the relation between black hole mass and luminosity. In contrast to other studies, we find no significant correlation of black hole mass with luminosity, other than those induced by circular reasoning in the estimation of black hole mass. The Eddington limit defines an approximate upper envelope to the distribution of luminosities, but the lower envelope depends entirely on the sample of AGNs included. For any given black hole mass, there is a range in Eddington ratio of up to 3 orders of magnitude., The astrophysical rp-process is thought to be responsible for the production of proton rich nuclides up to A ∼100. The role of the N ∼Z nuclei near A=80 in the nucleosynthetic process will be discussed. Emphasis will be placed on the ^80Zr beta decay half-life and isomers in ^80Y., The structure of ^26Si just above the proton threshold is the largest remaining uncertainty in the production of the galactic gamma-ray emitter ^26Al, whose characteristic 1.809 MeV gamma ray has been detected with the orbiting gamma-ray telescope COMPTEL/CGRO. The location of two unnatural parity states have been the dominant uncertainty until recently (Phys. Rev. C65, 055801 (2002)). The locations of these states have been confirmed by a high-resolution measurement of the ^28Si(p,t)^26Si reaction at 38 MeV using the Enge split-pole spectrograph at Yale. Spectrum resolution was three times better than ever attained using this reaction (25 keV). Complete data analysis and results will be presented., We consider the dynamics of timelike spherical thin matter shells in vacuum. A general formalism for thin shells matching two arbitrary spherical spacetimes is derived and subsequently specialized to the vacuum case. We first examine the relative motion of two dust shells by focusing on the dynamics of the exterior shell, whereby the problem is reduced to that of a single shell with different active Schwarzschild masses on each side. We then examine the dynamics of shells with nonvanishing tangential pressure p, and show that there are no stable-stationary, or otherwise-solutions for configurations with a strictly linear barotropic equation of state, p=ασ, where σ is the proper surface energy density and α∈(-1,1). For arbitrary equations of state, we show that, provided the weak energy condition holds, the strong energy condition is necessary and sufficient for stability. We examine in detail the formation of trapped surfaces, and show explicitly that a thin boundary layer causes the apparent horizon to evolve discontinuously. Finally, we derive an analytical (necessary and sufficient) condition for neighboring shells to cross, and compare the discrete shell model with the well-known continuous Lemaître-Tolman-Bondi dust case., We present a theoretical study of the radially pulsating δ Scuti and SX Phoenicis variables, concentrating on the blue straggler SX Phoenicis variables found in globular clusters. We have evolved a grid of stellar models with the metal abundance of the globular cluster M55, including models with alpha-enhanced metal abundances, and tested these models for radial pulsations observed in the high-amplitude δ Scuti and SX Phoenicis stars. Our grid includes models with globally enriched helium content to simulate the effects of stellar collisions and global mixing possible in blue stragglers. We find that global enrichment of helium strongly affects the temperature and luminosity of a given star, but the location of the instability strip blue edge and the slope of the period-luminosity (PL) relation are unchanged. This suggests that the PL relation is not affected by blue straggler formation if blue stragglers are fully mixed stellar mergers. Our blue edges and PL relations are in agreement with other theoretical determinations and also with the observational PL relation of M55, but they are not in agreement with the PL relation previously derived for high-amplitude δ Scuti stars in the field. Analysis of the double-mode variable, V41, suggests either that the star may not be pulsating in the first and second overtones as claimed or that normal stellar models may not be accurate models of blue straggler stars., The Sun is believed to have been the recipient of a substantial amount of metal-rich material over the course of its evolution, particularly in the early stages of the solar system. With a long diffusion timescale, the majority of this accreted matter should still exist in the solar convection zone, enhancing its observed surface abundance, and implying a lower abundance core. While helioseismology rules out solar models with near-zero metallicity cores, some solar models with enhanced metallicity in the convection zone might be viable, as small perturbations to the standard model. Because of the reduced interior opacity and core temperature, the neutrino flux predicted for such models is lower than that predicted by the standard solar model. This paper examines how compatible inhomogeneous solar models of this kind are with the observed low and intermediate degree p-mode oscillation data, and with the solar neutrino data from the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory Collaboration. We set an upper limit on how much metal-rich accretion took place during the early evolution of the Sun at ~2 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> of iron (or ~40 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> of meteoric material)., A mechanism for acceleration of protons is described, in which energy gain occurs near cyclotron resonance as protons drift through a sequence of rotating-mode TE<SUB>111</SUB> cylindrical cavities in a strong nearly uniform axial magnetic field. Cavity resonance frequencies decrease in sequence from one another with a fixed frequency interval Δf between cavities, so that synchronism can be maintained between the rf fields and proton bunches injected at intervals of 1/Δf. An example is presented in which a 122 mA, 1 MeV proton beam is accelerated to 961 MeV using a cascade of eight cavities in an 8.1 T magnetic field, with the first cavity resonant at 120 MHz and with Δf = 8 MHz. Average acceleration gradient exceeds 40 MV/m, average effective shunt impedance is 223 MΩ/m, but maximum surface field in the cavities does not exceed 7.2 MV/m. These features occur because protons make many orbital turns in each cavity and thus experience acceleration from each cavity field many times. Longitudinal and transverse stability appear to be intrinsic properties of the acceleration mechanism, and an example to illustrate this is presented. This acceleration concept could be developed into a proton accelerator for a high-power neutron spallation source, such as that required for transmutation of nuclear waste or driving a subcritical fission burner, provided a number of significant practical issues can be addressed., We have detected a population of predominantly blue (B-V&lt;=1.1) stars in the direction l=167<SUP>deg</SUP>, b=-35<SUP>deg</SUP> (Kapteyn Selected Area [SA] 71) that cannot be accounted for by standard star count models. Down to V ~ 20 mag, the colors and magnitudes of these stars are similar to those of the southern overdensity detected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) at l=167<SUP>deg</SUP>, b=-54<SUP>deg</SUP> and identified as stripped material from the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (Sgr dSph) galaxy. We present absolute proper motions of the stars in SA 71, and we find that the excess blue stars represent a distinct, kinematically cooler component than the Galactic field, in reasonable agreement with predictions of Sgr dSph disruption models. The density of the excess SA 71 stars at V~18.8 mag and B-V&lt;=1.1 is within a factor of 2 of the density of the SDSS-south Sgr dSph stripped material and of that predicted by the Helmi &amp; White disruption model. Three additional anticenter fields (SA 29, 45, and 118) show very good agreement with standard star count models., Establishing the formation mechanism of cluster galaxies gives direct information on the origins of the Hubble sequence and the morphology-density relation. Extensive studies with HST have led to a basic understanding of the star formation histories of cluster galaxies, but assessing the time and mechanism of their structural assembly has proven difficult, and has led to conflicting results. The main problem is the difficulty in distinguishing elliptical and S0 galaxies at high redshift. This proposal asks support to re-analyze the exquisite archival WFPC2 data on clusters at z~ 0.5 using two novel techniques, with the aim of determining objectively when and how elliptical and S0 galaxies in clusters were assembled. The goals are 1} to unambiguously distinguish elliptical and S0 galaxies in distant clusters using their ellipticities combined with spatially resolved kinematics, and 2} to determine the evolution of the galaxy merger fraction in clusters from the incidence of close pairs. Together, these projects give important new constraints on the assembly time of massive galaxies, and will put the ``elliptical versus S0'' controversy to rest. Keck spectroscopic data allowing measurements of spatially resolved kinematics are already obtained for 39 galaxies in four clusters. As a ``bonus'', the cluster-to-cluster scatter in the intermediate redshift Fundamental Plane of early-type galaxies will be determined., The Muon g - 2 collaboration has measured the anomalous magnetic g value of the positive muon with an uncertainty of 1.3 parts per million. The result a<SUB>mu</SUB><SUP>+</SUP>(expt) = 11659202(14)(6) x 10<SUP>-10</SUP>, based on data collected in 1999 at Brookhaven National Laboratory, is in good agreement with the preceding data on a<SUB>mu</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> and a<SUB>mu</SUB><SUP>-</SUP>, and improves the combined uncertainty by a factor of about three. The analysis of data collected in 2000 and 2001 is well underway and, when combined with data from a requested, final run in the fall of 2002 and winter of 2003, is expected to further improve the experimental uncertainty by a factor of about three to 0.4ppm. The measurement tests standard theory and has the potential to discover new physics., We have designed, constructed, and put into operation a large-area CCD camera that covers a large fraction of the image plane of the 1 m Schmidt telescope at Llano del Hato in Venezuela. The camera consists of 16 CCD devices arranged in a 4×4 mosaic covering 2.3d×3.5d of sky. The CCDs are 2048×2048 LORAL devices with 15 μm pixels. The camera is optimized for drift-scan photometry and objective-prism spectroscopy. The design considerations, construction features, and performance parameters are described in the following paper., Understanding the factors that contribute to U-Pb discordance in zircon is essential for interpreting isotopic data and for assessing the validity of concordia intercept ages. Modification caused by interaction with metamorphic fluids is often cited as a primary means by which significant or even complete isotopic resetting of U-Pb systematics in zircon might be achieved under subsolidus conditions. We present a field example from the Napier Complex, east Antarctica, in which a Palaeoproterozoic (2450-70 Ma) zircon population interacted locally with an Early Palaeozoic (498±1.7 Ma) aqueous fluid at upper-amphibolite facies conditions. Conventional ion microprobe analysis of sectioned and polished grain surfaces indicates that fluid interaction resulted in minor disturbance of U and Pb in zircons (both normal and reverse discordance) with limited displacement along a chord with a lower intercept that coincides with the timing of fluid infiltration. In contrast, ion probe 'drilling' or depth profiling into unpolished natural zircon crystal surfaces revealed extensive disturbance of U-Pb systematics, to depths of ∼0.2 μm, with near-surface ages consistent with the timing of fluid influx at ∼498 Ma. Although zircon underwent some radiogenic Pb redistribution during fluid interaction, infiltrating fluids resulted in minimal grain-scale isotopic modification of zircon. Based on ion probe depth profiling results, we propose that limited normal discordance observed in the conventional ion microprobe zircon analyses, in this case, is controlled by an analytical mixture of reset and/or recrystallised zircon along penetrative micro-fracture networks with that of adjacent unaffected zircon. We also suggest that the observed reverse discordance is genuine, resulting from localised intra-grain net accumulations of radiogenic Pb. We conclude that the isotopic response of zircon, in this case, is controlled by the interaction of an aqueous metamorphic fluid, of low to moderate salinity, resulting in sub-micrometre depth scale isotopic modification at natural crystal faces and along penetrative micro-fracture networks, and that grain-scale isotopic modification was negligible. Therefore, we urge caution when considering regional chronological interpretations that appeal to significant zircon isotopic resetting caused exclusively by metamorphic fluid interaction at upper-amphibolite facies conditions., We undertook a study of the star formation and chemical enrichment history of the Fornax dSph galaxy. We used the VLT with FORS1 to obtain photometry reaching the oldest main-sequence turnoffs and Ca II triplet spectroscopy of a sample of red giant branch stars in the same fields. The observations and the main results are described., Solar frequencies show a distinct change with solar activity. The changes in frequencies can be used to study the time variation of solar structure. In this talk I shall discuss what we learn about the changes in the Sun from the changes in frequency. The frequency variations appear to be dominated by surface effects rather than by changes in the deeper layers., The Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS), a SIRTF Legacy and HST Treasury program, will obtain the deepest multiwavelength observations, across the broadest wavelength range, of any astronomical field. It includes infrared (3.6-24 μ m) coverage with SIRTF IRAC and MIPS, high-resolution optical coverage with ACS, and ultra-deep X-ray observations with Chandra and XMM-Newton. The scientific goals are to trace the mass assembly history of galaxies and to probe the nature of their energetic output (from stars and AGN) over a broad span of cosmic history. To study the AGN in particular, we must distinguish them from the tens of thousands of normal galaxies. Here we present our approach to identifying AGN candidates through color selection, with particular emphasis on high-redshift and/or very dusty objects as candidates for follow-up spectroscopic studies. We have compiled a library of Spectral Energy Distributions (SED) of extragalactic objects, which we combine with appropriate evolution and cosmology to populate multi-dimensional color-color space. We then incorporate novel algorithms to characterize survey objects relative to template AGN, to obtain an efficient method for finding AGN in the GOODS fields., We have studied the <SUP>29</SUP>Si(<SUP>3</SUP>He,<SUP>6</SUP>He)<SUP>26</SUP>Si reaction and have identified new states in <SUP>26</SUP>Si at E<SUB>x</SUB>=5.140(10), E<SUB>x</SUB>=5.678(8) MeV, and E<SUB>x</SUB>=5.945(8). Based on these measurements and other recent evidence, we suggest spin-parity assignments of 1<SUP>+</SUP> for the 5.678 MeV state and 3<SUP>+</SUP> for the 5.945 MeV state, which would account for all the ``missing'' unnatural parity states in <SUP>26</SUP>Si in the excitation energy region important to hydrogen burning in novae. New reaction rates are presented for the <SUP>25</SUP>Al(p,γ)<SUP>26</SUP>Si reaction based on this possible assignment of states., We examine the origin of neutrino masses and oscillations in the context of the six-dimensional standard model. The space-time symmetries of this model explain proton stability and forbid Majorana neutrino masses. The consistency of the six-dimensional theory requires three right-handed neutrinos, and therefore Dirac neutrino masses are allowed. We employ the idea that the smallness of these masses is due to the propagation of the right-handed neutrinos in a seventh, warped dimension. We argue that this class of theories is free of gravitational anomalies. Although an exponential hierarchy arises between the neutrino masses and the electroweak scale, we find that the mass hierarchy among the three neutrino masses is limited by higher-dimension operators. All current neutrino oscillation data, except for the LSND result, are naturally accommodated by our model. In the case of the solar neutrinos, the model leads to the large mixing angle, MSW solution. The mechanism employed, involving three right-handed neutrinos coupled to a scalar in an extra dimension, may explain the features of the neutrino spectrum in a more general class of theories that forbid Majorana masses., For twenty years, scientists and society alike have averred that discrimination against women is a thing of the past, which may be largely true for the most overt kind of discrimination. Yet judging from the scarcity of women in the physical sciences in the U.S. today, it is clear that these professions efficiently filter out women (and probably other minorities). Not only are women present in much smaller numbers than men at all levels, their presence decreases with increasing rank in the academic hierarchy, and women advance more slowly and with greater attrition than men. Notably, the pre-college pipeline is no longer the critical issue, since women are present in large numbers in introductory science and math classes at top undergraduate institutions. However, there is little agreement on what the critical problem might be, much less its solution. Furthermore, most physical scientists in academia, which is to say male full professors, have paid relatively little attention to this problem and are not well informed about the current status of women in their fields or the extensive research on gender bias. I review the relevant statistics and some of this research. I conclude that progress is possible if people in positions of power adopt the inclusion of women as a priority. This will enhance excellence in our profession, both because it taps a wider pool of talent and because it corrects the bias that has (under the assumption of equal distribution of talent among men and women) excluded some of our best scientists., We report on spectroscopic imaging observations of the nearby (z=0.022) galaxy cluster 3C 129 performed with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer detector on board the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. Applying a deprojection analysis that fully takes into account the spatially resolved X-ray energy spectra, we investigate the radial variation of temperature and particle density of the intracluster medium (ICM). While earlier data indicated a weak cooling flow and a cool cluster core, the Chandra data suggest that the core is hotter than the rest of the cluster: at the center we infer 7.9<SUP>+4.4</SUP><SUB>-2.4</SUB> keV, while the mean temperature of all the other ICM shells is 5.1+/-0.3 keV (all errors at 90% confidence level). Based on the radial entropy profile, we discuss the evidence for shock heating of the ICM at the cluster center. We discuss the possibility of using imaging spectroscopy data of more regular clusters to extract maps of the gravitational dark matter potential., Elastic anisotropy is present where the speed of a seismic wave depends on its direction. In Earth's mantle, elastic anisotropy is induced by minerals that are preferentially oriented in a directional flow or deformation. Earthquakes generate two seismic wave types: compressional (P) and shear (S) waves, whose coupling in anisotropic rocks leads to scattering, birefringence, and waves with hybrid polarizations. This varied behavior is helping geophysicists explore rock textures within Earth's mantle and crust, map present-day upper-mantle convection, and study the formation of lithospheric plates and the accretion of continents in Earth history., An overview of the structure, funding, personnel and problems facing the research universities provides the basis for some prediction concerning their future., We will present ratios of identified particles at high momenta which were measured with the STAR-RICH at RHIC in Au-Au collisions. The RICH detector allows for the idenfication of pions and kaons with momenta up to 3 GeV/c and protons up to 5 GeV/c. The physics implications will be discussed., Recent Chandra observations have shown conclusively that AGN jets can emit high-energy radiation at large distances from the AGN's central black hole. The exact origin of this emission is still a puzzle. I will review critically the current theoretical explanations for this emission and will explore the implications of the emission for the energetics and structure of an AGN jet., We present timing and broad-band (3-1000 keV) spectral analyses of joint RXTE/OSSE data obtained for Cygnus X-1 during December 1998. Using the EQPAIR XSPEC model, we demonstrate that a pure thermal Comptonization model, with Compton reflection, fits the 3-1000 keV data well. No additional components are necessary to fit the data, although the presence of an additional non-thermal component does marginally improve the goodness of fit. Two of the observations can also be better fit by a hybrid model where most of the electrons have a steep power-law (non-thermal) energy distribution. We discuss how to the break the degeneracy between the spectral models. The observed spectrum between 30-50 keV does not show strong curvature. For either continuum model, this implies that the fraction of the continuum flux that is Compton reflected must be intrinsically low. Strongly ionizing the reflecting matter can supress reflection features at lower energies but not at these energies. We discuss the constraints on flux variability models from higher order timing statistics such as the skewness and bispectrum., We compare published estimates of black hole masses for AGN and galaxies, including direct measurements of dynamical mass (mostly for nearby galaxies) and many more indirect estimates, mostly from reverberation mapping or from emission line widths combined with a size estimate from optical luminosity. We find that, for individual objects, different estimates can span several orders of magnitude. We also evaluate a new estimate, based on properties of the AGN host galaxies, assuming they are like normal galaxies. In contrast to previous studies, we find no significant correlation of black hole mass with luminosity, other than those induced by circular reasoning in the estimation of black hole mass. This shows there must be a large range of Eddington ratios in AGN, of at least three orders of magnitude, which correlates with luminosity. Comparing AGN and normal galaxies in the luminosity-black hole mass plane, we find no gap between them, suggesting that AGN activity decreases smoothly toward the non-active state., The reaction ^9Be + ^232Th arrow ^241Pu, at beam energies of 50 and 55 MeV, was used in an attempt to populate states in the second minimum (fission isomer) of ^238Pu via the 3n evaporation channel. Prompt gamma-rays, detected using YRAST Ball and conversion electrons, detected using ICE Ball, were collected in coincidence with delayed fission events measured using elements of the Yale SCARY array of solar cell detectors. The solar cell detectors were shielded so as not to view the large prompt fission flux from the target. Instead the detectors were located so that they could detect delayed fission events, originating from the 6 ns fission isomer state in ^238Pu, which occur downstream from the target position. Data analysis is in progress and results to date will be presented. This work is partly supported by the U.S. DOE under grant numbers DE-FG02-91ER-40609, DE-FG02-88ER-40417., The gravitational collapse of an infinite cylindrical thin shell of generic matter in an otherwise empty spacetime is considered. We show that geometries admitting two hypersurface orthogonal Killing vectors cannot contain trapped surfaces in the vacuum portion of spacetime causally available to geodesic timelike observers. At asymptotic future null infinity, however, congruences of outgoing radial null geodesics become marginally trapped, due to the convergence induced by the shear caused by the interaction of a transverse wave component with the geodesics. The matter shell itself is shown to be always free of trapped surfaces, for this class of geometries. Finally, two simplified matter models are analytically examined. For one model, the weak energy condition is shown to be a necessary condition for collapse to halt; for the second case, it is a sufficient condition for collapse to be able to halt., In October 2000, a new class of dynamic symmetries was introduced to describe spectra of systems at the critical point of quantum phase transitions [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 3580 (2000)]. This new class extends the concept of dynamic symmetry to one of the most challenging and sensitive situations one may encounter in quantal systems. Spectra are given in terms of zeros of special functions. In particular, for second order transitions, energy levels at the critical point are given in terms of zeros of Bessel functions (Euclidean invariance). In this presentation, the new class of symmetries will be discussed and applications to spectra of atomic nuclei at the critical point of the U(5)-SO(6) shape phase transition will be presented. The new symmetry can be formulated in any number of dimensions and has potential applications in several areas of Physics and Chemistry. Possible applications to systems other than nuclei (molecules, atomic clusters, polymers, etc.) will be mentioned., In this contribution, we illustrate that by combining lensing and X-ray surface brightness data the elongation of clusters along the line-of-sight can be estimated. The distribution of three dimensional shapes of the mass in clusters of galaxies could potentially place constraints on Ω and provide clues to the nature of dark matter. With the abundance of multi-wavelength data the prospects for mapping the three-dimensional shapes are promising., Hot-electron bolometer (HEB) mixers are promising candidates for use in terahertz heterodyne receivers. The input RF signal is amplitude modulated by the addition of a carrier signal. The electron temperature of the superconducting microbridge oscillates only at the envelope frequency ( GHz), and when biased in the vicinity of the superconducting transition, the device resistance modulates at this frequency. Based on microwave measurements, we have shown that the properties of diffusion-cooled HEBs depend on the critical temperature. Lower critical temperature mixers have greater sensitivity (mixer noise temperature scales with Tc) but are more prone to saturation effects. Nb-Au devices use the S-N proximity effect to tune the critical temperature of the microbridge. For a given application, the optimum critical temperature is determined from the scaling data. A HEB mixer with this Tc can then be fabricated by choosing an appropriate thickness of gold to be deposited on top of the niobium. We present the experimental results and microscopic model calculations., We introduce the octopole moment measurement of the light distribution in galaxies as a probe of the weak lensing shear field. While traditional ellipticity estimates of local shear have traditionally been limited by the width of the background intrinsic ellipticity distribution, the dispersion in the intrinsic octopole distribution is expected to be quite small, meaning that the signal is ultimately limited by measurement noise, not by intrinsic scatter. In a series of estimates, we show that current observations are at the regime where the octopole estimates will be able to contribute to the overall accuracy of the estimates of local shear fields., We present broadband and narrowband Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images of the central region of the heavily disturbed Virgo cluster galaxy NGC 4438 (Arp 120), whose nucleus has been described as a type 1 LINER or dwarf Seyfert galaxy. Narrowband Hα and [N II] HST images reveal striking bipolar shell features, 1 kpc in projected length from end to end, that are likely the result of an outflow from the nuclear region experiencing a strong interaction with the interstellar medium (ISM). While these outflow shells share similarities with those in some other starburst or active galactic nucleus (AGN) galaxies, those in NGC 4438 are notable because NGC 4438 harbors neither a luminous circumnuclear starburst nor a luminous AGN. The shells appear to be closed at their outer ends, suggesting that the outflow in NGC 4438 is dynamically younger than those in some other galaxies. The radio continuum emission is strongly enhanced near the outer ends of the shells, suggesting working surfaces arising from collimated nuclear outflows that have impacted and shocked the surrounding ISM. The two shells are quite different, as the northwestern shell is luminous and compact, while the southeastern shell is 2.5 times longer and much fainter in both optical emission lines and the nonthermal radio continuum. The differences between the two shells may be attributed to a difference in ISM density on the two sides of the nuclear disk. Such an ISM asymmetry exists on larger scales in this heavily disturbed galaxy. At the base of the outflow is a nuclear source, which is the highest surface brightness source in the galaxy at optical wavelengths. This source is resolved with a FWHM=0.3""=25 pc and has modest luminosities, uncorrected for extinction, of 5×10<SUP>38</SUP> ergs s<SUP>-1</SUP> in Hα and M<SUB>B</SUB>=-13. We discuss whether the outflow is powered by a low-luminosity AGN or a compact nuclear starburst. The kinetic energy associated with the ionized gas in the shells is ~10<SUP>53</SUP> ergs, which could be produced by either massive star formation or an AGN. While the northwestern shell, which contributes most of the flux in most ground-based apertures centered on the nucleus, exhibits LINER-type line ratios, the nucleus has an Hα/[N II] ratio consistent with an H II region. Although there appears to be very little massive star formation occurring in the central kpc, the nucleus may contain a partially obscured, young nuclear star cluster. On the other hand, the collimation of the southeastern shell and the strongly enhanced radio continuum emission at the outer ends of the shells are more easily explained by jets associated with a nuclear black hole than by a compact nuclear starburst, although there is no direct evidence of a jet. The 2000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> broad-line component could be due to an AGN broad-line region but might also be due to high-velocity gas in the outflow. Since NGC 4438 has a large bulge, a large nuclear black hole might be expected. Based on observations with the Hubble Space Telescope, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555., We present results from our survey of RR Lyrae stars in the halo of the Milky Way. Since these stars are standard candles, the survey is capable of finding spatial structures in the halo, such as streams of debris left by the destruction of small satellites by the tidal forces of the Milky Way. We have found a large clump of stars at 50 kpc from the galactic center which is likely related to a tidal tail of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Several other over-densities were found in different regions. The halo of the Milky Way does not seem to have a uniform distribution of stars far from the galactic center., This paper reviews some recent work on the properties of the outer halos of galaxies. I particularly focus on recent and upcoming advances made with the study of globular clusters. Globular clusters can be observed out to ~ 100 kpc from the centers of galaxies, allowing the study of galactic halos well beyond the regions probed by many other techniques such as observations of the integrated light of galaxies. In the few well-studied cases to date, the study of globular cluster systems has provided dynamical evidence for dark matter halos around elliptical galaxies, and demonstrated kinematic differences between different globular cluster populations that shed light on the formation history of their host galaxies., The general consensus is that in order to reproduce the observed solar p-mode oscillation frequencies, turbulence should be included in solar models. However, until now there has not been any well-tested efficient method to incorporate turbulence into solar modeling. We present here two methods to include turbulence in solar modeling within the framework of the mixing length theory, using the turbulent velocity obtained from numerical simulations of the highly superadiabatic layer (SAL) of the Sun at three stages of its evolution. The first approach is to include the turbulent pressure alone, and the second is to include both the turbulent pressure and the turbulent kinetic energy. The latter is achieved by introducing two variables: the turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass and the effective ratio of specific heats owing to the turbulent perturbation. These are treated as additions to the standard thermodynamic coordinates (e.g., pressure and temperature). We investigate the effects of both treatments of turbulence on the structure variables, the adiabatic sound speed, the structure of the highly superadiabatic layer, and the p-mode frequencies. We find that the second method reproduces the SAL structure obtained in three-dimensional simulations and produces a p-mode frequency correction an order of magnitude better than the first method., A new technique is proposed to measure the flattening of dark matter halos using weak gravitational lensing. The shape parameters of the mass distribution of foreground galaxies can be measured from the two-dimensional shear field derived from background galaxies using an extension of the standard galaxy-galaxy lensing scheme. Modeling galaxies using an elliptical, isothermal profile, it is demonstrated that measuring the flatness is feasible with data from the on-going Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)., We report the demonstration of a sensitive absolute-gravity gradiometer based on light-pulse atom-interference techniques. The gradiometer consists of two absolute accelerometers operated in a differential mode. We report a differential acceleration sensitivity of 4×10<SUP>-9</SUP>g/Hz<SUP>1/2</SUP> and an inferred differential acceleration accuracy of less than 10<SUP>-9</SUP>g. This corresponds to a gravity-gradient sensitivity of 4E/Hz<SUP>1/2</SUP> (1E=10<SUP>-9</SUP> s<SUP>-2</SUP>) and an accuracy of better than 1E for a 10-m separation between accelerometers. We demonstrate that the instrument can be used to detect nearby masses in a vibrationally noisy environment and characterize instrument sensitivity to spurious acceleration and rotation noise., We present an experiment detecting X-rays by an annular Nb-based Superconducting Tunnel Junction (STJ). In one magnetic field configuration, we stably trapped a single magnetic fluxon in the STJ barrier during the transition to the superconducting state. This is an innovative configuration which avoids the use of an externally applied field during detector operation. This offers potential benefits for STJs used in imaging arrays. In this configuration, and also in the conventional one with an externally applied parallel magnetic field, we observed current pulses produced by single 6 keV X-rays. The pulses were identical for both configurations. ., We present results of development of imaging superconducting tunnel junction detectors in the optical/UV energy range. Our detectors have a Ta strip absorber with Al tunnel junctions located on the two ends of the strip. The tunnel junction area does not overlap the absorber. Using devices designed for large backtunneling gain, we have measured an energy resolution of 0.4 eV at 4.89 eV. The resolution in these devices is limited by thermodynamic fluctuations of the thermal quasiparticle number in the Al trapping layers. We predict that this previously unconsidered noise source should be important in any backtunneling device with ``deep'' traps. We are currently developing detectors designed to eliminate this noise and, consequently, backtunneling gain. These devices need small junctions, of order 1 square micron, for best noise performance. The resolution of these devices should approach the intrinsic limits of creation and trapping statistics, and exceed the resolution of devices with backtunneling. ., We have developed single-photon, one-dimensional imaging detectors based on superconducting tunnel junctions. The devices have a Ta absorber with an Al/AlO<SUB>x</SUB>/Al tunnel junction readout on each end. The best energy resolution is 13 eV FWHM at 6 keV in an area of 20×100 μm<SUP>2</SUP>. For devices with a Nb ground contact to the center of the Ta absorber, the energy resolution is worse in the center of the Ta absorber. This nonuniformity is caused by the Nb ground contact. A device with a Ta ground contact to the base electrode of one of the junctions was tested. We obtain an energy resolution of 26 eV in the large region at the center of the absorber, where this energy resolution is determined by the junction response. The diffusion constant of Ta and the loss time of quasiparticles in Ta are also studied by measuring three devices with different size absorbers. ., The first and possibly only major rise of atmospheric oxygen, from p<SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB></SUB> ≤ 0.1% PAL (the present atmospheric level) to p<SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB></SUB> ≥ 10% PAL, appears to have occurred sometime before 2 Ga ago, although the exact time of and the cause(s) for the rise have been hotly debated. Equally important questions on the atmospheric oxygen concern its stability, especially the mechanisms regulating the atmospheric p<SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB></SUB> level and the causes and magnitude of p<SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB></SUB> variations since the first major rise of atmospheric oxygen. Previous efforts to model the p<SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB></SUB> variation during the Phanerozoic time have typically relied on secondary information, such as the carbon and sulfur isotopic records of sedimentary rocks, and on simple dynamics of the geochemical cycles of O, C, S, and P based on box-type models. As a result, many kinetic questions about the variation and stability of atmospheric oxygen could not have been answered. Here we quantitatively evaluate the dynamics and stability of atmospheric O<SUB>2</SUB> and CO<SUB>2</SUB>, using recent experimental data, field observations, and a new model for the C-O coupled geochemical cycles. We examine the change with time in the fluxes of various compounds (O<SUB>2</SUB>, CO<SUB>2</SUB>, phosphate, organic C, carbonate C, C-bearing reduced volcanic gases, and C-free reduced volcanic gases) among the various reservoirs (atmosphere, soil, surface ocean, deep ocean, the lower crust and mantle, and upper crust) under a variety of scenarios. Our model does not assume steady-state fluxes for any of the reservoirs. Rather, the model incorporates the kinetic experimental data on oxidation of coal, a proxy for kerogen, the dynamics of soil formation and erosion, the kinetics of decomposition of organic matter in the Oceans by aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, the equilibrium ocean-atmosphere carbonate model, the observed relationships among the organic burial flux, dissolved O<SUB>2</SUB> content of deep ocean, and sedimentation rates, and the three-box model ocean. The important parameters that strongly influence the dynamics of atmospheric O<SUB>2</SUB>, are found to be (a) the total area of soil formation on Earth; (b) the average soil depth; (c) the average rate of physical erosion of soils, which is linked to the average rate of accumulation of clastic sediments in the oceans; (d) the composition and flux of volcanic gas; and (e) the level of atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB>. We develop kinetic equations linking these parameters to the production and consumption fluxes of atmospheric oxygen and also to stable p<SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB></SUB> values. Considering the likely ranges of variations in these parameters in geologic history, we suggest that the atmospheric p<SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB></SUB> level is likely to have stayed within a very narrow range of 0.6-2 PAL and that the entire ocean, except for local euxinic basins, is likely to have been basically oxygenated since the first major rise of atmospheric oxygen more than 2 Ga ago., The Hipparcos mission discovered 5665 new or previously suspected variable stars. Among these are 308 recently named variables common to ""The Bright Star Catalogue"". The distributions of these HR stars according to types of variation and amplitude are discussed., We present the results of a large scale survey for RR Lyrae variable stars in the halo of the Milky Way. These stars are excellent tracers of the old population of the Galaxy and thus, they can hold important clues about its formation and early evolution. The survey is designed to detect numerous stars at large distances from the galactic center, a region which has been poorly studied in the past. If the halo of the Milky Way was formed by the accretion of small satellite galaxies, as current evidence favors, the signatures of such events may be visible in the outer halo. Numerical models indicate that satellite galaxies under disruption processes leave a stream of stars along its path around the Galaxy. Thus, the halo may be criss- crossed by multiple streams of tidal debris, remnants of now extinct small satellite galaxies. The results of our survey indicates that the outer halo of the Milky Way is significantly clumpy. In particular we have detected three large structures. One of them is located at 50 kpc from the galactic center and it seems to be related to tidal debris from the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy, which is known to be in the process of disruption. A second structure is probably associated with the destruction of the globular cluster Palomar 5, at 17 kpc from the GC. The third group, at 19 kpc, is not related with any known cluster or dwarf galaxy but its properties seem to indicate that it may be part of the remnants of a disrupted ancient galaxy. In addition, two other structures have been detected but they are smaller and may not be statistically significant. In addition, the large sample of RRs allow us to study the shape of the halo. The spatial distribution of the RR Lyrae stars in our survey is well described by a flattened component in the inner halo and a spherical components at distances larger than 20 kpc from the galactic center, as was proposed by previous studies. The decline in the halo stellar density in the range of 4 to 60 kpc, is well described by the power law ρ(a) = (4.2 ± 1.5)(a/R<SUB>0</SUB>)<SUP> (-3.1 ± 0.1)</SUP>kpc<SUP>-3</SUP>., , In this paper, we introduce the octopole moment of the light distribution in galaxies as a probe of the weak-lensing shear field. While traditional ellipticity estimates of the local shear derived from the quadrupole moment are limited by the width of the intrinsic ellipticity distribution of background galaxies, the dispersion in the intrinsic octopole distribution is expected to be much smaller, implying that the signal from this higher order moment is ultimately limited by measurement noise, and not by intrinsic scatter. We present the computation of the octopole moment and show that current observations are at the regime in which the octopole estimates will soon be able to contribute to the overall accuracy of the estimates of local shear fields. Therefore, the prospects for this estimator from future data sets such as the Advanced Camera for Survey and the Next Generation Space Telescope are very promising., To constrain the nature of the very first stars, we investigate the collapse and fragmentation of primordial, metal-free gas clouds. We explore the physics of primordial star formation by means of three-dimensional simulations of the dark matter and gas components, using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, under a wide range of initial conditions, including the initial spin, the total mass of the halo, the redshift of virialization, the power spectrum of the DM fluctuations, the presence of HD cooling, and the number of particles employed in the simulation. We find characteristic values for the temperature, T~a few 100 K, and the density, n~10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, characterizing the gas at the end of the initial free-fall phase. These values are rather insensitive to the initial conditions. The corresponding Jeans mass is M<SUB>J</SUB>~10<SUP>3</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>. The existence of these characteristic values has a robust explanation in the microphysics of H<SUB>2</SUB> cooling, connected to the minimum temperature that can be reached with the H<SUB>2</SUB> coolant, and to the critical density at which the transition takes place between levels being populated according to non-LTE (NLTE), and according to LTE. In all cases, the gas dissipatively settles into an irregular, central configuration that has a filamentary and knotty appearance. The fluid regions with the highest densities are the first to undergo runaway collapse due to gravitational instability, and to form clumps with initial masses ~10<SUP>3</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>, close to the characteristic Jeans scale. These results suggest that the first stars might have been quite massive, possibly even very massive with M<SUB>*</SUB>&gt;~100 M<SUB>solar</SUB>. After a gas element has undergone runaway collapse, and has reached densities in excess of 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, a sink particle is created. This procedure allows us to follow the evolution of the overall system beyond the point where the first nonlinear region would otherwise force the calculation to a halt. These later evolutionary stages, during which the clumps grow in mass due to accretion and merging with other clumps, are quite sensitive to the initial conditions. The key process in building up very massive clumps, with masses up to a few times 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>, is merging between clumps. Since the merging rate sensitively depends on the density of the gas, halos with the highest degree of central concentration are able to assemble the most massive clumps. Among these are halos with a low spin (λ~=0.01), and with DM fluctuations imprinted according to a white-noise spectrum., The types of star clusters found in galaxies are an indication of the star formation processes within them. Here we examine compact star clusters in irregular galaxies in order to learn what conditions are necessary for the formation of populous and super-star clusters. We have searched 22 nearby irregular galaxies for compact star clusters using data from the HST archives. Eight of these were found to host compact clusters, 3 of which have populous clusters, which we define as clusters with an M<SUB>V</SUB> &lt; -9.5 at an age of 10 Myr. The same three galaxies also contain super-star clusters, which we define as clusters with an M<SUB>V</SUB> &lt; -10.5 at 10 Myr. We combine these galaxies with four others from the literature, two of which contain populous and super-star clusters. With the exception of WLM, which contains a globular cluster, we find a galactic magnitude cutoff of M<SUB>V</SUB> = -16, fainter than which galaxies do not form compact clusters, although there are many brighter barren galaxies. The galaxies containing populous clusters also have normalized star formation rates of 0.003 solar masses yr<SUP>-1</SUP> kpc<SUP>-2</SUP> or higher, again excluding WLM. We argue that the formation of super-star clusters in irregular galaxies requires extraordinary circumstances (e.g. a starburst, strong bar, or interaction) but only to bring the star formation rate up to a high level somewhere in the system. We note that super-star clusters often are surrounded by additional compact clusters of similar age, suggesting that the formation of the super-star cluster occurred in a large star-forming complex with several compact star clusters as part of the debris of star formation. This is consistent with previous results suggesting that dwarf galaxies form stars only in localized regions of high gas column density, where the pressure is sufficient to allow a cool phase of gas to exist in equilibrium, and where self-gravity is strong., The Spectral Correlation Function (SCF) is a relatively new algorithm for analyzing the position-velocity information contained in large-scale spectral-line maps (see Rosolowsky, Goodman, Wilner,&amp; Williams 1999, ApJ, 524, 887; Padoan, Rosolowsky, &amp; Goodman 2001, ApJ, 547, 862). We have now applied the SCF to several different regimes in the ISM, and we are able to derive the following results. (1) The SCF is the most discriminating method we know of for comparing synthetic (numerical) and observed spectral-line data cubes. (2) Tests of various simulations against data using the SCF show that no simulation to date is completely realistic, but models where the magnetic field has less than its equipartition value do better than strong field models in molecular clouds. (3) Comparisons of numerical models with H I observations of the atomic ISM show that the models must, but do not yet, treat thermal effects thoroughly (Ballesteros-Paredes, Vazquez-Semadeni &amp; Goodman, ApJ, submitted). (4) The SCF can, and has been, used to determine the scale-height of a nearly face-on galaxy observed in H I (e.g. the LMC, see Padoan, Kim, Goodman, &amp; Staveley-Smith 2001, ApJL, 555, L33)., We collected all estimates of black hole masses for AGN and galaxies that were available from the literature. These include some direct measurements of dynamical mass (mostly for nearby galaxies) and many more indirect estimates (mostly from reverberation mapping or from emission line widths combined with a size estimate from optical luminosity). We compare the values for black hole mass generated by the different methods and find, for individual objects, a scatter as high as a couple of orders of magnitude. We also evaluate a new estimate, based on properties of the AGN host galaxies, assuming they are like normal galaxies. In contrast to other studies, we find no significant correlation of black hole mass with luminosity, other than those induced by circular reasoning in the estimation of black hole mass. This shows there must be a large range of Eddington ratios in AGN, of at least three orders of magnitude. Comparing AGN and normal galaxies in the luminosity-black hole mass plane, we find no gap between them, suggesting that AGN activity decreases smoothly toward the non-active state., We assess the potential of asteroseismology for determining the fundamental properties of individual δ Scuti stars. We computed a grid of evolution and adiabatic pulsation models using the Yale Rotating Evolution Code to study the systematic changes in low-order (l=0, 1, 2, and 3) modes as functions of fundamental stellar properties. Changes to the stellar mass, chemical composition, and convective core overshooting length change the observable pulsation spectrum significantly. In general, mass has the strongest effect on evolution and on pulsation followed by the metal abundance. Changes to the helium content have very little effect on the frequencies until near the end of the main sequence. Changes to each of the four parameters change the p-mode frequencies more, in both absolute and relative terms, than they do the g- and mixed-mode frequencies, suggesting that these parameters have a greater effect on the outer layers of the star. We also present evolution and pulsation models of the well-studied star FG Virginis, outlining a possible method of locating favorable models in the stellar parameter space based on a definitive identification of only two modes. Specifically, we plot evolution models on the (period-period ratio) and (temperature-period ratio) planes to select candidate models and modify the core overshooting parameter to fit the observed star. For these tests, we adjusted only the mass, helium and metal abundances, and core overshooting parameter, but this method can be extended to include the effects of first-order rotational splitting and second-order rotational distortion of pulsation spectra., The flux of metals to the oceans from land masses follows two pathways, streams and the air. Elements supplied from continents to the oceans must pass either the gauntlet of the reactive estuarine environment if delivered by streams or the convective storm effects of continental margins if by air. Therefore it is difficult to assess the fluxes of metals like mercury, lead and osmium, which can be transported either by streams or through the air to the open ocean. The flux from volcanoes complicates the supply picture further. We have calculated the atmospheric flux of Os at New Haven, Connecticut based on measurements of Os concentrations on aerosols and the Pb-210 flux. If that flux were operative throughout the world oceans it would dominate the supply of Os to the oceans relative to the stream flux as discussed below and the residence time of Os in the world ocean would be several hundred years. This value is considerably shorter than the approximately ten thousand years required by the small geographic variability in Os-187/Os-188 ratios observed in the oceans. Most atmospherically transported Os from the continents must therefore be removed from the atmosphere at the continental margin and subject to subsequent removal from sea water into sediments by coastal processes. The best assessment of atmospheric Os delivery to the open ocean from the continents is through the analysis of fluxes of Al and Pb-210 via aerosols at the Pacific oceanic islands used in the SEAREX campaign. This flux is considerably smaller than the stream flux discussed below and therefore not a serious source of Os to the open oceans. The flux from streams is dependent on the degree of retention in estuaries. The evidence for retention is from reactive estuaries such as Long Island Sound. Strong flushing of estuaries or direct debouching of the river into the open ocean will result in an unattenuated transfer of Os to the open ocean. We presume that, on the basis of published results, about half of the Os delivered through the world estuarine zones actually reaches the open ocean. The residence time of Os in the oceans relative to this dominant source is about ten thousand years. The situation in the past may be more complex. A strong correlation of He-3 concentration with Os-187/Os-188 has been observed in the well studied north Pacific core, GPC3, prior to the sharp increase of aeolian sediment accumulation in the north Pacific about 35 million years ago. This correlation requires either: (1) a strong influence of a volcanic source of sediments coupled with a supply of Os from ophiolite weathering, both resulting from plate collisions or (2) the simultaneous supply of volcanic ash and mantle signature Os from volcanoes to the oceans. Either process would modify the continental source of Os even more strongly than at present. Evidence for the first possibility is found in Quaternary sediment cores and for the second in atmospheric measurements of Os at oceanic islands., Recent theoretical investigations have suggested that the formation of the very first stars, forming out of metal-free gas, was fundamentally different from the present-day case. The question then arises which effect was responsible for this transition in the star formation properties. In this paper, we study the effect of metallicity on the evolution of the gas in a collapsing dark matter mini-halo. We model such a system as an isolated 3σ peak of mass 2×10<SUP>6</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB> that collapses at z<SUB>coll</SUB>~=30, using smoothed particle hydrodynamics. The gas has a supposed level of pre-enrichment of either Z=10<SUP>-4</SUP>Z<SUB>solar</SUB> or 10<SUP>-3</SUP>Z<SUB>solar</SUB>. We assume that H<SUB>2</SUB> has been radiatively destroyed by the presence of a soft UV background. Metals therefore provide the only viable cooling at temperatures below 10<SUP>4</SUP>K. We find that the evolution proceeds very differently for the two cases. The gas in the lower metallicity simulation fails to undergo continued collapse and fragmentation, whereas the gas in the higher metallicity case dissipatively settles into the centre of the dark matter halo. The central gas, characterized by densities n<SUB>H</SUB>&gt;~10<SUP>4</SUP>cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, and a temperature, T~=90K, that closely follows that of the cosmic microwave background, is gravitationally unstable and undergoes vigorous fragmentation. We discuss the physical reason for the existence of a critical metallicity, Z<SUB>crit</SUB>~5×10<SUP>-4</SUP>Z<SUB>solar</SUB>, and its possible dependence on redshift. Compared with the pure H/He case, the fragmentation of the Z=10<SUP>-3</SUP>Z<SUB>solar</SUB> gas leads to a larger relative number of low-mass clumps., This thesis concentrates on the analysis of a unique Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer(RXTE)/Oriented Scintillation Spectrometer Experiment(OSSE) data set for Cygnus X-1. <P />We find: <P />(1) Autocorrelation and cross-correlation analyses of Cyg X-1 require an active rather than a static corona and the observed hard time lags must come from coronal variations rather than light travel times, <P />(2) The lightcurves of Cyg X-1 and GX 339-4 show a different sense of asymmetry on long timescales than on short timescales. This requires a second process driving the long timescale variability, perhaps an energy reservoir. <P />(3) The hard-state X/γ-ray spectrum of Cyg X-1 is well modelled with a single corona, and is shown to have a reflection fraction substantially less than unity. Hybrid thermal/non-thermal models are preferred over pure thermal models. <P />(4) In the soft and transition states, the iron line of Cyg X-1 has a constant equivalent width, requiring that the line emission comes primarily from the disk/corona system, and a constant blackbody temperature, requiring that coronal changes drive the variability. <P />(5) The spectra of GRS 1915+105 are well fit by hybrid Comptonization models, often with large non-thermal electron fractions. Reflection features are washed out at high optical depths. Disk radii can be correctly fit with these models. <P />(6) The spectra of neutron star Aql X-1 can be well fit with thermal Comptonization models. Bursts are used to probe the corona in neutron stars. The state transitions occur at variable luminosities, casting doubt on propeller models., We have obtained high-dispersion spectra for a sample of 256 pre-main-sequence stars in the Orion Nebula cluster to measure their projected rotational velocities and investigate the rotational evolution and physical properties of young low-mass stars. Half the stars were chosen because they had known photometric periods and the other half were selected as a control sample of objects without known periods from the same portion of the H-R diagram. More than 90% of the spectra yielded vsini measurements, although about 1/3 are upper limits. We find strong evidence confirming the long-held assumption that the periodic light variations of T Tauri stars are caused by rotation of spots on their surfaces. We find no statistically significant difference between the vsini distributions of the periodic and control samples, indicating that there is no strong bias in studying the rotational properties of young stars by using periodic variables. Likewise, the classical and weak T Tauri stars exhibit vsini distributions that are statistically the same. For stars with known period and vsini, the mean value of sini is significantly lower than expected for a random distribution of stellar rotation axes. This could be caused by errors in one or more of the quantities that contribute to the sini calculation or to a real physical effect. We investigate the possible causes and find that &lt;sini&gt; has the expected value if we increase the effective temperatures of our stars by 400-600 K. Finally, we have calculated minimum radii (Rsini) for stars with both vsini and period, as well as average radii for objects grouped by their location in the H-R diagram. We find evidence at the 3 σ level that the radii of the stars on similar mass tracks are decreasing as the stars move closer to the zero-age main sequence., The Hiberno-Latin literary metaphor of ""Xpistus sol verus"" (Christ the True Sun) finds an architectural analogue in the orientation of the single eastern window of Irish monastic stone chapels or oratories. The author's field surveys in Ireland, Hebrides, Orkney and Shetlands revealed that the window of Irish rectangular dry stone oratories framed the rising solar disk on the Feast Days of selected saints of the Celtic Early Christian Church, AD 800-1100. The most frequent target skyline declinations were to sunrise on the Feast Days of St. Patrick (March 17th) and St. Aidan of Lindisfarne (August 31st). During the Early Christian period, St. Patrick's Day coincided with the Vernal Equinox, and heralded the Paschal Full Moon (i.e., Passover crucifixion) and Easter Sunday as proclaimed by Emperor Constantine at the Council of Nicaea (AD 325). St. Aidan of Lindisfarne (d. AD 651) inspired the Irish monks who, at the Synod of Whitby (AD 664), remained loyal to the Jewish 84-year cycle determining Passover and refused to replace it with the new orthodox 19-year computus for Easter adopted by the Roman Catholic Church (AD 527). Hypothetical affiliation between monastic communities whose oratories share common solar orientation, interior length/width ratios (e.g., 4:3 and 3:2) and units of measurement (e.g., Scottish ell, Coptic cubit, or Roman pes) is discussed. Grateful acknowledgement is made to the Michael D. Coe Fund and Augusta Hazard Fund of Yale University for research grant support in 1999., As an educational tool, the Small Radio Telescope (SRT) is continuously being modified and improved in both software and hardware. Its original analog receiver allowed users to observe only 1420 MHz hydrogen emission and strong continuum sources like the sun; this limitation prompted development of a digital version to expand the telescope's capabilities. The digital receiver, which has replaced the analog on our telescope, has increased stability and sensitivity- these greatly extend the scope of research possible with the SRT. This newfound flexibility necessitated a search for appropriate radio sources, eventually concentrated on OH masers. Calibration and equipment tests, as well as software updates, are ongoing as the refinement of the receiver continues. The research and testing process for the digital receiver, as well as a description of the projects now available to the SRT, are outlined here. This research was conducted as part of an NSF REU program at MIT Haystack Observatory in Westford, MA., We describe an ongoing program dedicated to the observation of NEOs found by the northern discovery programs and whose tracks carry them into the Southern Hemisphere. We are observing the NEOs, to determine their positions, compute improved orbits and submit them to the Minor Planet Center over the Internet. Alerts of needed observations are monitored on relevant Web pages and e-mail messages from our collaborators at the northern discovery programs. The observations are made at the Cesco Observatory at El Leoncito, Argentina with the 0.5-meter double astrograph and/or at CTIO with the 1.0-meter YALO telescope, depending on the magnitude of the NEO and the photometric requirements for the specific NEO. The double astrograph at El Leoncito observes simultaneous CCD B and V photometry and astrometry for those NEO's brighter than 20, while the YALO observes those brighter than 21.5. YALO also provides simultaneous V and IR photometry and astrometry. All YALO observations are ftp'd to San Juan for astrometric reduction and then a revised orbit is computed from the new and existing observations in Mendoza and a decision is made to retarget our observations if necessary. If so, the El Leoncito and/or YALO observers are notified and provided with an improved ephemeris. The final positions and photometry are then forwarded to the MPC, MPEC and our collaborators. To date, we have reported the positions of over 2000 asteroids, 61 comets and 142 NEOs., Here we report measurements of the phase curve for 2000 EB173, a bright Plutino with opposition magnitude R=19.1 and red color V-R=0.57+/-0.05 discovered by the QUEST survey[1]. We made all observations from November 2000 to May 2001 with 1.0-meter Yale Telescope at Cerro Tololo, Chile using Johnson V and R filters and CCD. Exposures times were short (&lt;5 minutes) to allow small-aperture photometry, calibrated with secondary standards in each field which we observed on photometric nights. The phase curve, measured from phases of 0.28 to 1.9 degrees, is linear with a slope of 0.165 mag/deg. Assuming a curve of the form defined by Bowell et al. [2], a minimal chi-squared fit to our R observations yields H=4.99+/-0.01, G=0.16+/-0.06 (assuming V-R=0.57). We see no evidence for rotational modulation greater than 0.05 magnitudes, and the V-R color we measure at phase angle 1.8 degrees is consistent with earlier measurements. The phase curve is unusually steep compared to other icy bodies observed in the outer solar system [3]. [1] Ferrin, I. et al., ApJ 548, L243-247, 2001; [2] Bowell, E. et al., in Asteroids II (eds.

Arizona Press Tucson, 1989) ; [3] Schaefer, B. and Tourtellotte, S., Icarus 151, 112-117, 2001., We report on Chandra ACIS observations of the radio galaxy 3C 390.3 which reveals spatially extended X-ray emission from the northern and the southern hotspot regions. We compare the complex X-ray morphology of the hotspot regions with their radio morphology. We argue that Synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated by the highly non-stationary and non-uniform plasma naturally accounts for the observed X-ray emission and radio to X-ray energy spectra. We discuss the implications for the dynamics of the jet fluid and particle acceleration processes. ., ISAC, a new radioactive beam facility at TRIUMF in Canada, is presently operational and will provide a range of high-intensity short-lived beams with energies from 0.15 to 1.5 MeV/u, for studies in nuclear astrophysics and nuclear physics. One major application of such studies is in the expansion of our present understanding of stellar explosions such as novae and x-ray bursts, since the energy generation and nucleosynthesis in these settings are controlled mainly by reactions involving alpha- and proton-capture on unstable nuclei. In particular, key reactions in the Hot CNO cycles, NeNa and MgAl cycles, as well as reactions that may bridge the Hot CNO cycles to the αp- and rp-processes, are of special interest. Many of these reactions are presently not well understood, pointing to the need for laboratory measurements using radioactive beams. Part of the experimental effort at ISAC will center on using the DRAGON mass separator to measure these important capture reactions in inverse kinematics. This presentation will give an overview of the new ISAC facility, results from the commissioning of DRAGON and status of the initial experiments of the first reaction of interest, namely, ^1H(^21Na,^22Mg)γ., We present the results of simultaneous observations of the TeV blazar Markarian 421 at X-ray and TeV gamma-ray energies with the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer and the stereoscopic Cerenkov telescope system of the High Energy Gamma-Ray Astronomy (HEGRA) experiment, respectively. The source was monitored from 2000 February 2 to 16 and from 2000 May 3 to 8. In both energy bands several flares with very rapid flux variability were observed. In the X-ray band, the flux increased and decreased with e-folding times as short as about 5 hr. The 3-20 keV photon index varied between values of 2.2 and 2.9. For five pointings the data show statistically significant evidence for spectral curvature. The photon index varied substantially on very short timescales: on 2000 February 11 it hardened within 1.6 hr by ΔΓ=0.18, and on February 14 it softened within 1.6 hr by ΔΓ=0.2. The TeV observations of February 7/8 showed statistically significant evidence for substantial TeV flux variability on a 30 minute timescale. The TeV energy spectrum averaged over all the observations of the campaign shows a similar steep slope as in earlier HEGRA observations: dN/dE=N<SUB>0</SUB>(E/1 TeV)<SUP>-Γ</SUP> with N<SUB>0</SUB>=(25+/-1<SUB>stat</SUB>)×10<SUP>-12</SUP> photons cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> TeV<SUP>-1</SUP> and Γ=2.94+/-0.06<SUB>stat</SUB>. Within statistical errors no evidence for a curvature of the TeV energy spectrum is found. We show the results of modeling the data with a time-dependent homogeneous synchrotron self-Compton model. The X-ray and TeV gamma-ray emission strengths and energy spectra together with the rapid flux variability strongly suggest that the emission volume is approaching the observer with a Doppler factor of 50 or higher. The different flux variability timescales observed at X-rays and TeV gamma rays indicate that a more detailed analysis will require inhomogeneous models with several emission zones., An algorithm is designed to search for statistically significant peaks in the time profiles of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) detected by the Burst And Transient Source Experiment (BATSE). Strong evidence of time dilation is found in the peak-to-peak time scales derived from GRBs with multiple peaks and duration greater than 2 seconds. The peak-to-peak time scales derived show that there is a factor of 1.92 +/- 0.13 time stretching between bright and dim GRBs. The time stretching is interpreted as evidence of cosmological time dilation which stretches the light curves of GRBs by a factor of (1 + z). For the single peak bursts, their T<SUB>90</SUB> duration distribution is found to be bimodal similar to all other bursts. The bimodality in the GRB distribution is not due to the distinction between bursts with a single peak and bursts with multiple peaks. The observed time dilation effect in the peak-to-peak time scales, together with the LogN-LogP number counts vs. brightness relation and direct redshift measurements of GRBs are used to constrain the luminosity function of GRBs for two cases of cosmological models. For the cosmological model with (Ω<SUB>0</SUB>, Ω<SUB>Λ</SUB>) = (10, 0.0), it is found that the time dilation relation and LogN-LogP relation calculated from the model are not compatible with the observational data. The cosmological model with (Ω<SUB>0</SUB>, Ω<SUB>Λ </SUB>) = (0.3, 0.7) is found to reproduce all three pieces data if the density evolution of GRBs traces the star formation rate and the luminosity function has an average observable luminosity of &lt;L<SUB>observed</SUB>&gt; = 5.0 × 10<SUP>51</SUP> ~ 1.0 × 10<SUP>52</SUP> ergs . s<SUP>-1</SUP>. This implies that majority of GRBs are at redshifts of 1~3., The superposed pair of spiral galaxies making up NGC 3314 offers a unique opportunity to trace the dust properties in a spiral galaxy. We analyze multicolor Hubble Space Telescope imaging, supported by ground-based near-IR imaging and fiber-array spectroscopy, to measure dust extinction in the foreground Sc galaxy NGC 3314A, which is backlit by the Sb system NGC 3314B. The superposition allows us to measure extinctions over a wide range of galactocentric radii in the foreground galaxy from 0.4-4.5 kpc. In the outer half of the disk, the extinction is strongly localized in discrete dust lanes, including some patches whose galactic setting is clear only because of associated Hα emission at the foreground velocity. These dust features show an extinction curve with a slope close to the Galactic mean (R=3.5+/-0.3) over a range in galactocentric radius from 1.6 to 3.8 kpc, with no radial trend. Using the I-K color of the background nucleus, we derive an extinction of A<SUB>I</SUB>=3.3 through the disk at a projected distance of 400 pc from the nucleus of NGC 3314A. The extinction in even the inner disk of NGC 3314A is quite patchy, since background Hα emission is detected from all parts of the system. Local anticorrelations between foreground and background line emission demonstrate that the dust is concentrated in star-forming regions, as has been found for the blue light in several systems. The colors of the dust lanes in NGC 3314A that are projected only partially against the background disk indicate that the dust scale height in the foreground disk is substantially smaller than that of the stars. The color-intensity behavior of the net light in these regions tracks the predictions of a thin-layer model closely. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555., In stellar evolution calculations, the local pressure scale height is often used to empirically constrain the amount of convective core overshoot. However, this method brings unsatisfactory results for low-mass stars (&lt;=1.1-1.2 M<SUB>solar</SUB> for Z=Z<SUB>solar</SUB>), which have very small cores or no convective core at all. Following Roxburgh's integral constraint, we implemented an upper limit of overshoot within the conventional method of α parameterization to remove an overly large overshoot effect on low-mass stars. The erroneously large effect of core overshoot due to the failure of α parameterization can be effectively corrected by limiting the amount of overshoot to &lt;=15% of the core radius; 15% of the core radius would be a proper limit of overshoot, which can be implemented in a stellar evolution code for intermediate- to low-mass stars. The temperature structure of the overshoot region does not play a crucial role in stellar evolution since this transition region is very thin., I. The spectra of Type IIn supernovae indicate the presence of a pre-existing slow, dense circumstellar wind (CSW). If the CSW extends sufficiently far from the progenitor star, then dust formation should occur in the wind. The light from the supernova explosion will scatter off this dust and produce a light echo. We calculate the brightness of the light echo as a function of time for a range of dust shell geometries, and use our calculations to fit to the light curves of SN 1988Z and SN 1997ab, the two slowest declining IIn supernovae on record. While we find that the light curves of both objects can be reproduced by the echo model, more subtle properties of the emission cannot. We conclude that light echoes cannot properly account for the slow decline seen in some IIn's, and that a shock interaction is likely to dominate the continuum emission. II. IT is currently not known whether the Universe has an intergalactic magnetic field IGMF If such a field does exist, it would have had an effect on a wide range of astrophysical processes. High energy (&gt;20 GeV) photons emitted by cosmologically distant blazars will pair-produce with photons from the IR/optical background. These pairs cool by Compton upscattering cosmic microwave background (CMB) and optical photons, producing an extended photon halo about a high energy source as a result. If an IGMF is present, the electrons and positrons will be deflected by the Lorentz force as they traverse intergalactic space and the size of the extended halo will increase. We calculate the effect of the IGMF on the expected cascade halo and show that this effect could be used to improve the current constraints on the IGMF by as much as 13 orders of magnitude. III. We present the results of a search for an X-ray cascade halo in a Chandra observation of the region surrounding the blazar 1156 + 295. We show that the observed emission is consistent with a point source, i.e. no cascade halo is observed. While firm predictions are hard to make, estimates for the intrinsic TeV flux of the blazar from broadband spectral fits imply that the IGMF should exceed 10<SUP>-21</SUP> G to explain the non-detection. This implies that some form of field amplification must have occurred in the Universe. IV. Polarization effects are likely to be important in calculations involving induced (simulated) Compton scattering. The non-linear coupling to the radiation field, however, complicates the introduction of these effects into an equation of radiative transfer. A quantum mechanical derivation is presented for the case of low frequency radiation scattering off cold electrons. We reproduce, with a slight modification, the equation of Wilson (1982). We proceed to generalize the result of Wilson by relaxing the assumptions of low photon energy by considering the problem in a relativistic framework., The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) commenced operation for physics in the Summer of 2000. Initial results on collider performance, detector performance of the STAR experiment, and preliminary physics results on hadron production from STAR will be reported., HST has provided definitive observations of AGN host galaxies, over a large redshift range. These can be used to measure the cosmic evolution of host galaxies and to assess the connection between the formation and evolution of active nuclei {black holes} and galaxies. This requires covering a range in luminosity at each redshift, however, in order to distinguish dependences on redshift and on luminosity, which {unfortunately} are automatically well correlated in flux- limited samples. Yet *very* few low-power AGN have been imaged at high redshift {z &gt; 0.5} with HST. We propose to fill this critical gap by observing 10 BL Lac objects in the STIS CCD long-pass filter {to maximize sensitivity and spatial sampling}. BL Lacs are the only low-power AGN in complete samples to sufficient redshift {z&gt; 1} to detect the effects of passive evolution of the host galaxies. Results for a closely matched sample at redshifts z &lt;=sssim 0.5 are already available from our HST snapshot survey of BL Lac objects, which yielded detailed information on host galaxy morphologies, magnitudes, surface brightness profiles, and effective radii at low redshift. The proposed study thus probes the evolution of low-power AGN host galaxies to z 1.3, and allows direct study of how the formation and life cycles of radio-loud AGN depend on intrinsic power., We present an analysis of age, metal abundance, and positional data on populous clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) with the ultimate aim of determining the line-of-sight (LOS) depth of the SMC by using these clusters as proxies. Our data set contains 12 objects and is limited to clusters with the highest-quality data for which the ages and abundances are best known and can be placed on an internally consistent scale. We have analyzed the variation of the clusters' properties with position on the sky and with line-of-sight depth. Based on this analysis, we draw the following conclusions: (1) The observational data indicate that the eastern side of the SMC (facing the Large Magellanic Cloud) contains younger and more metal-rich clusters as compared with the western side. This is not a strong correlation because our data set of clusters is necessarily limited, but it is suggestive and warrants further study. (2) Depending on how the reddening is computed to our clusters, we find a mean distance modulus that ranges from (m-M)<SUB>0</SUB>=18.71+/-0.06 to 18.82+/-0.05. (3) The intrinsic +/-1 σ LOS depth of the SMC populous clusters in our study is between ~6 and ~12 kpc, depending primarily on whether we adopt the Burstein &amp; Heiles reddenings or those from Schlegel et al. (4) Viewing the SMC as a triaxial galaxy with declination, right ascension, and LOS depth as the three axes, we find axial ratios of approximately 1:2:4. Taken together, these conclusions largely agree with those of previous investigators and underscore the utility of populous star clusters as probes of the structure of the Small Magellanic Cloud., The host galaxies of radio-loud AGN can be characterized extremely well with HST data. We propose to extend our survey of low-power radio-loud AGN to much higher power, over a matching redshift range {0.1&lt;=sssim z&lt;=sssim 1.5}. Our study has two primary goals: beginitemize em{1} To assess the possible correlation of AGN nuclear luminosity with host galaxy magnitude, which might be expected from the black hole mass - bulge mass correlation in local galaxies. This has profound implications for the origin and evolution of galaxies and black holes. em{2} To observe directly evolution of the host galaxies of radio-loud AGN, without the usual confusion caused by the {unphysical} L-z correlation inherent in flux- limited samples. enditemize The proposed archival project concerns 69 quasars and radio galaxies from the well-defined 2 Jy sample. Building on our strong record of HST results on low-power AGN, this work will lead to a uniformly analyzed sample of nearly 200 radio-loud AGN, spanning a broad range in nuclear power at each redshift. Host galaxies will be detected and well characterized for at least half the sample, with careful attention to error analysis, using our already- developed analysis software., An important new probe of the physics of large-scale radio jets is possible with the discovery of resolved X-ray/optical jets. The optical emission comes from high energy electrons, which have short radiative lifetimes and so pinpoint particle acceleration sites. Spectral energy distributions of knots in two jets suggest the X-rays come from lower energy electrons inverse-Compton scattering the {beamed} cosmic microwave background. This requires the jet to be still relativistic on kiloparsec scales {out to 1 Mpc for the high-redshift jets.}. This model robustly constrains both the bulk relativistic speed and the minimum electron energy in the jet, which together determine the total jet power. To probe jet energetics and physics generally, and to test the ``Compton/CMB'' interpretation specifically, we propose deep HST imaging of three X-ray/optical jets {PKS 1127-145, PKS 0637-752, 3C 371} and one optical jet {PKS 2201+044}, plus Chandra observations of the latter two. The multiwavelength spectra of individual knots differ significantly, as does one jet from another, indicating the need for detailed high- resolution study of more than 1 or 2 jets. Along with the well-observed 3C 273 and M 87 jets, the 4 proposed targets are the only known {or likely} nonthermal X-ray jets readily detected with Chandra and HST., Field W Ursae Majoris binaries observe a well-known period-color relation such that systems containing more massive stars are bluer and have longer orbital periods than systems with lower mass components. However, it has been known for a decade that metal-poor W Ursae Majoris binaries are too blue, have too short an orbital period, or both. Correcting the observed color for the reduced line blanketing in the atmosphere of a Population II star accounts for only part of the observed discrepancy. As others have suggested and Rucinski recently showed, the smaller radii of Population II stars and the correspondingly shorter orbital periods are responsible for the remainder. In this paper I investigate the effect of evolution on the location in the period-color plane. This paper addresses the restricted case of equal-mass components in critical contact with their inner Roche lobes but should be applicable to the more general cases to the extent that the relative sizes of stellar components are preserved with metallicity changes. The calculated metallicity-age dependent period-color relations substantially agree with Rucinski &amp; Duerbeck's recent empirically derived corrections to the period-color relation over most of the investigated range of periods. However, our predictions deviate to a greater degree as stellar age increases, since their parameterization does not include the effect of evolution., We present BVIJK photometry of the black hole candidate GRO J1655-40 in full quiescence. We report a refined orbital period of 2.62191+/-0.00020 days. The light curves are dominated by ellipsoidal variations from the secondary star. We model the light curves with an upgraded code that includes a more accurate treatment of limb darkening. Previous models containing a large cool disk are ruled out, and, indeed, our data can be fitted with a pure ellipsoidal light curve without any disk contribution. In general agreement with previous results, we derive a confidence region of the correlated quantities inclination and mass ratio, centered on an inclination of 70.2d+/-1.9d and mass ratio of 2.6+/-0.3, resulting in a primary mass M<SUB>1</SUB>=6.3+/-0.5 M<SUB>solar</SUB> (all 95% confidence). The complex limits and errors on these values and on the possible disk contribution to the light curve are discussed., Solid state <SUP>13</SUP>C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used to examine kerogen composition in weathering profiles of the Monterey, Green River, Woodford, and New Albany formations. Techniques include cross polarization (CP) and Bloch decay (BD) spectral acquisition, dipolar dephasing (DD), spin counting, experiments to provide estimates of relaxation times (T <SUB>1ρ</SUB>H and T <SUB>1</SUB>H), and proton spin relaxation editing (PSRE). It is demonstrated that CP/MAS (cross polarization/magic angle spinning) spectra obtained on isolated kerogens provide reliable characterization of kerogen composition (compared with BD spectra and whole-rock samples). Highly aliphatic (polymethylenic) kerogens are not appreciably altered during weathering. Aromatic and/or branched aliphatic kerogens accumulate oxidation products and preferentially lose aliphatic relative to aromatic carbon during weathering. No relation is observed between T <SUB>1ρ</SUB>H times and either kerogen composition or degree of weathering; T <SUB>1</SUB>H times correlate with aromaticity. Two distinct components within kerogens are discerned by PSRE: one highly aliphatic (largely polymethylenic) component and one mixed aliphatic/aromatic component. During weathering, the highly aliphatic component remains largely unaltered, while the mixed component loses aliphatic carbon and accumulates carbonyl oxidation products. Thus it appears that kerogen weathering is dominated by two separate processes: Linear alkyl fragments are cleaved without oxidation, and aromatic/branched alkyl fragments are oxidized while attached to the kerogen macromolecule and then cleaved., Temporal variations of the structure and the rotation rate of the solar tachocline region are studied using helioseismic data from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) and the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) obtained during the period 1995-2000. We do not find any significant temporal variation in the depth of the convection zone, the position of the tachocline or the extent of overshoot below the convection zone. No systematic variation in any other properties of the tachocline, like width, etc., is found either. The possibility of periodic variations in these properties is also investigated. Time-averaged results show that the tachocline is prolate with a variation of about 0.02R<SUB>solar</SUB> in its position. Neither the depth of the convection zone nor the extent of overshoot shows any significant variation with latitude., ., We report optical, infrared, and X-ray light curves for the outburst, in 2000, of the black hole candidate XTE J1550-564. We find that the start of the outburst in the H and V bands precedes that seen in the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer All-Sky Monitor by 11.5+/-0.9 and 8.8+/-0.6 days, respectively; a similar delay has been observed in two other systems. About 50 days after the primary maxima in the VIH light curves, we find secondary maxima, most prominently in H. This secondary peak is absent in the X-ray light curve but coincides with a transition to the low/hard state. We suggest that this secondary peak may be due to nonthermal emission associated with the formation of a jet., We have measured the periods and light curves of 148 RR Lyrae variables from V=13.5 to 19.7 from the first 100 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of the Quasar Equatorial Survey Team RR Lyrae survey. Approximately 55% of these stars belong to the clump of stars detected earlier by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. According to our measurements, this feature has ~10 times the background density of halo stars, spans at least 37.5d by 3.5d in α and δ (&gt;=30 by &gt;=3 kpc), lies ~50 kpc from the Sun, and has a depth along the line of sight of ~5 kpc (1 σ). These properties are consistent with the recent models that suggest that it is a tidal stream from the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy. The mean period of the type ab variables, 0.58 days, is also consistent. In addition, we have found two smaller overdensities in the halo, one of which may be related to the globular cluster Pal 5., The locations of <SUP>18</SUP>Ne+α resonances have been measured as excited states in <SUP>22</SUP>Mg using the <SUP>12</SUP>C(<SUP>16</SUP>O,<SUP>6</SUP>He)<SUP>22</SUP>Mg reaction. Eighteen new levels were discovered in the range 0&lt;=E<SUB>c.m.</SUB>&lt;=3 MeV above the <SUP>18</SUP>Ne+α threshold. The <SUP>18</SUP>Ne(α,p)<SUP>21</SUP>Na reaction rate in the temperature range 0.2&lt;=T&lt;=1.0 GK has been calculated using the results from the present measurements, and the implications for nuclear burning in explosive stellar scenarios are discussed. This study also yielded energy-level information on low-lying <SUP>21</SUP>Na + p resonances of importance to the <SUP>21</SUP>Na(p,γ)<SUP>22</SUP>Mg reaction, one of the key links in the NeNa cycles in novae., Developed at Yale for use in undergraduate astronomy courses, Showfits is the premier web-based image analysis tool. Showfits provides all the functionality necessary for undergraduate level (and often research level) image manipulation, including image convolutions, rotations, aperture photometry, centroid calculation, flat-fielding, dark subtracts, and stacking. Moreover, the Graphical User Interface is platform independent and highly intuitive. Most of the calculations are transparent to the user, making the program useful pedagogically. Finally, as a web-based tool, it is a convenient way to make images taken on a local telescope easily viewable to the outside public., Plane-wave (ring-diagram) analysis of high-degree modes in data from the SOI/MDI instrument on SOHO have enabled us us to determine the structure and dynamics of about 0.1 solar radius below the photosphere, and study how these quantities change with time. The bulk of the work done so far has utilized full-disc data for which the analysis has the ability to resolve structures with a scale of about 180 Mm. Additional data with three times the spatial resolution over a small portion of the disc are available for shorter durations at various times. Here we report on details of various trends which not resolved by full-disc data., We calculate the generic spectral signature of an early population of massive stars at high redshifts. For metal-free stars with mass above 300 M<SUB>solar</SUB>, we find that the combined spectral luminosity per unit stellar mass is almost independent of the mass distribution of these stars. To zeroth order, the generic spectrum resembles a blackbody with an effective temperature of ~10<SUP>5</SUP> K, making these stars highly efficient at ionizing hydrogen and helium. The production rate of ionizing radiation per stellar mass by stars more massive than ~300 M<SUB>solar</SUB> is larger by ~1 order of magnitude for hydrogen and He I and by ~2 orders of magnitude for He II than the emission from a standard initial mass function. This would result in unusually strong hydrogen and helium recombination lines from the surrounding interstellar medium. It could also alleviate the current difficulty of ionizing the intergalactic medium at z&gt;~6 with the cosmic star formation rate inferred at somewhat lower redshifts., The Milky Way satellites offer the possibility of studying their star formation histories in great detail. Color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) reaching the old main-sequence turnoffs, allow a careful modelling of their stellar populations using synthetic CMDs, and spectroscopy of the brightest stars, provides a direct measurement of their metallicity. Here I present new wide field, old main sequence turnoff photometry of the LMC and Fornax, and briefly discuss preliminary results of a CaII triplet spectroscopy study of metallicities of individual stars in Fornax., Luminous Blue Compact Galaxies (LBCGs) at redshifts z ∼ 0.2 - 1.3are very similar to the most luminous low-mass starbursts in the local universe. Recently, various results have highlighted the key role that LBCGs play in our understanding of galaxy evolution over cosmological timescales. For instance: i) LBCGs have evolved more than any other galaxy class in the last ∼ 8 Gyrs; ii) LBCGs are a major contributor to the observed enhancement of the star formation rate density of the universe at z ≤ 1; iii) LBCGs may be lower-mass counterparts of the recently discovered star-forming galaxies atz ∼ 3; and iv) some LBCGs at z ≤ 1 are optimum candidates to be the progenitors of today's spheroidal galaxies, such as NGC 205. In this paper, we review current research on LBCGs at intermediate redshifts, with emphasis on their mass estimates., In this paper, we present a redshift-space reconstruction scheme that is analogous to and extends the perturbative least action (PLA) method described by Goldberg &amp; Spergel. We first show that this scheme is effective in reconstructing even nonlinear observations. We then suggest that by varying the cosmology to minimize the quadrupole moment of a reconstructed density field, it may be possible to lower the error bars on the redshift distortion parameter, β, as well as to break the degeneracy between the linear bias parameter, b, and Ω<SUB>M</SUB>. Finally, we discuss how PLA might be applied to realistic redshift surveys., On 1999 May 26, one of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) fiber-fed spectrographs saw astronomical first light. This was followed by the first spectroscopic commissioning run during the dark period of 1999 June. We present here the first hour of extragalactic spectroscopy taken during these early commissioning stages: an observation of the Coma cluster of galaxies. Our data samples the southern part of this cluster, out to a radius of 1.5d (1.8 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc, approximately to the virial radius) and thus fully covers the NGC 4839 group. We outline in this paper the main characteristics of the SDSS spectroscopic systems and provide redshifts and spectral classifications for 196 Coma galaxies, of which 45 redshifts are new. For the 151 galaxies in common with the literature, we find excellent agreement between our redshift determinations and the published values, e.g., for the largest homogeneous sample of galaxies in common (63 galaxies observed by Colless &amp; Dunn) we find a mean offset of 3 km s<SUP> -1</SUP> and an rms scatter of only 24 km s<SUP> -1</SUP>. As part of our analysis, we have investigated four different spectral classification algorithms: measurements of the spectral line strengths, a principal component decomposition, a wavelet analysis and the fitting of spectral synthesis models to the data. We find that these classification schemes are in broad agreement and can provide physical insight into the evolutionary histories of our cluster galaxies. We find that a significant fraction (25%) of our observed Coma galaxies show signs of recent star formation activity and that the velocity dispersion of these active galaxies (emission-line and poststarburst galaxies) is 30% larger than the absorption-line galaxies. We also find no active galaxies within the central (projected) 200 h<SUP>-1</SUP> kpc of the cluster. The spatial distribution of our Coma active galaxies is consistent with that found at higher redshift for the CNOC1 cluster survey. Beyond the core region, the fraction of bright active galaxies appears to rise slowly out to the virial radius and are randomly distributed within the cluster with no apparent correlation with the potential merger or postmerger of the NGC 4839 group. We briefly discuss possible origins of this recent galaxy star formation., We present the first radial velocity measurement of the stellar component of the Local Group dwarf galaxy Phoenix, using the FORS1 instrument at the VLT's Unit Telescope 1 (Antu). From the spectra of 31 red giant branch stars, we derive a heliocentric optical radial velocity for Phoenix of V<SUB>solar</SUB>=-52+/-6 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. On the basis of this velocity, and taking into account the results of a series of semianalytical and numerical simulations, we discuss the possible association of the H I clouds observed in the Phoenix vicinity. We conclude that the characteristics of the H I cloud with heliocentric velocity -23 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> are consistent with this gas having been associated with Phoenix in the past and being lost by the galaxy after the last event of star formation in the galaxy, about 100 Myr ago. Two possible scenarios are discussed: the ejection of the gas by the energy released by the supernovae (SNe) produced in that last event of star formation and a ram pressure stripping scenario. We derive that the kinetic energy necessary to eject the gas is E<SUB>SNe</SUB>~2×10<SUP>51</SUP> ergs and that the number of SNe necessary to transfer this amount of kinetic energy to the gas cloud is ~20. This is consistent with the number of SNe expected for the last event of star formation in Phoenix, according to the star formation history derived by Martínez-Delgado, Gallart, &amp; Aparicio. The drawback of this scenario is the regular appearance of the H I cloud and its anisotropic distribution with respect to the stellar component. Another possibility is that the H I gas was stripped as a consequence of ram pressure by the intergalactic medium. In our simulations, the structure of the gas remains quite smooth as it is stripped from Phoenix, keeping a distribution similar to that of the observed H I cloud. Both in the SNe ejection case and in the ram pressure sweeping scenario, the distances and relative velocities imply that the H I cloud is not gravitationally bound to Phoenix, since this would require a Phoenix total mass about an order of magnitude larger than its total estimated mass. Finally, we discuss the possibility that Phoenix may be a bound Milky Way satellite. The minimum required mass of the Milky Way for Phoenix to be bound is M<SUB>MW</SUB>(&lt;450 kpc)&gt;=1.2×10<SUP>12</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>, which comfortably fits within most current estimates. Based on observations collected in visitor mode with the VLT UT1, Antu, at the European Southern Observatory, Chile., We present a well-sampled photometric time series (57 V magnitudes on 52 nights) of Nereid over a 128-day time span in 1998. The light curve shows an amplitude of 0.52 mag (from 19.11 to 19.63 mag) with a single peak (at JD 2451019±2) that is smooth and time symmetric. The date of the peak coincides with opposition (JD 2451018) and the entire 1998 light curve varies roughly linearly with the solar phase angle. This shows that the 1998 light curve is dominated by an extreme example of opposition surge. While a fraction of the photometric data from 1987-1997 agrees with this 1998 phase function, large and significant deviations were seen by all observers on time scales from hours to days to months during the years 1987-1997. Hence, there must be at least two mechanisms capable of making Nereid change in brightness, for which only the opposition surge was operating in 1998., The movement of fluids in the crust and upper mantle not only lead to important mineral reactions but also play an essential role in the geochemical cycling of elements and in controlling global change. Numerous papers have focused on calculation of fluid fluxes driving metamorphic reactions in the earth's crust. The extent of reaction in nature has been ""inverted"" to predict the total amount of fluid that was required to drive that much reaction. These models, although based on thermodynamic equilibrium, have extended the earlier concept of water-rock ratio. Any quantitative treatment of the fluid fluxes and the relationship between these fluxes and other variables such as temperature and mineral abundances requires a kinetic model. A simple model is presented that incorporates the essential dynamics of metamorphic processes including both heat flow by conduction and convection as well as fluid flow in and out of a representative volume. Overall mineral reactions can then take place within this rock volume in response to internal and external factors. The production and subsequent expulsion of excess fluids (H <SUB>2</SUB>O and CO <SUB>2</SUB>) as a result of these reactions leads to increased fluid fluxes, which the model can also handle. Using this kinetic model, the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium can be tested and forward calculations can compare the numbers ""inverted"" for total integrated fluid fluxes based on equilibrium with the ""actual"" integrated fluid fluxes. Other effects such as changes in the temperature field or the presence of dispersion/diffusion can also be readily quantified with this kinetic model. The nontrivial consequences of heterogeneity in natural systems make the kinetic approach much more essential but at the same time much more ""invertible"" than earlier approaches. Ultimately, the effects of the rates of overall mineral reactions and their interplay with the other kinetic processes taking place in these open systems have to be evaluated to guide us in developing much more powerful and correct ways of extracting fluid velocities from petrologic field data., When the Maria Mitchell Observatory was erected in 1908 to house the 5-inch telescope that had been given Maria Mitchell in 1859, Mrs. Lydia Hinchman, niece of Maria and the principal co-founder of the Maria Mitchell Association, wanted the Observatory to specialize in research while not neglecting public relations entirely. She contacted Professor E. C. Pickering, Director of Harvard College Observatory, for advice. He recommended installing a photographic telescope and having the astronomer specialize in observations of variable asteroids, Eros in particular. Margaret Harwood, one of his assistants at Harvard, was chosen to head the Maria Mitchell Observatory, a post she held for 45 years. Besides lesser contributions, she published a catalogue of 74 asteroids known to have variable brightness. She discovered DF Cygni, an unusual type of variable star with multiple periods, and analyzed its variation on Harvard and Nantucket plates spanning over 50 years. Her final masterpiece was an analysis of 419 variable stars in the Scutum region of the Milky Way, the majority of the variables having been discovered by her High School assistant John Heath. The second Director, Dorrit Hoffleit, instituted a new project, Summer Research Participation on Variable Stars by College Undergraduates, especially women. This project was continued by her successor, Emilia Belserene. Nearly 200 college undergraduates participated in these programs. The fourth Director, Eileen Friel concentrated on both observational and theoretical researches on star clusters, her student contributing few papers on variable stars. The current Direcor, Vladimir Strelnitski, again enthusiasticlly specializes on modern problems of variable stars., We gathered the maxima of Mira Ceti (1596-2000) in order to evaluate the frequency of two consecuitve bright apparitions. We did an evaluation of the correlation between two following maxima in order to verify the probability of occurrence of two consecutive bright maxima. Analysing the maxima of Mira, we found a probability of seeing it brighter than ? Ceti once every 21 years. In this case, as in February 1997, Mira can be detected at the first sight as a new component near the most significant asterism in its zone, and composed of ???????and ? Ceti. We found also a correlation between the magnitude of two consecutive maxima described by the linear fit: Mi+1 - Mi = -(1.10 Ã± 0.08) Mi + (3.74 Ã± 0.26), with R=-0.74. This study was done to test whether Mira could have been the Star of Bethlehem and fulfilled the hypothesis suggested by Kepler of a new star that appeared during the triple conjunction at 1 degree of Jupiter and Saturn that occurred in 7-6 B.C.E., The severity and spatial extent of the health impact of anthropogenic mercury (Hg) emission to the atmosphere depend on the emission rate and chemical form of the emitted species. The few measurements of combustion flue gas give highly variable results about how the emission is divided between the elemental (Hg°) and reactive forms and are difficult to extrapolate to a regional scale. Here we combine measurement of total gaseous mercury (TGM) and carbon dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>) concentrations at a background site in the winter with carbon (C) emission inventory to show that at a regional (500 km) scale, the effective anthropogenic Hg° flux is 41(±2) g km<SUP>-2</SUP>yr<SUP>-1</SUP> in the north-east United States. This regional-scale flux was higher under clear skies than under cloudy skies, suggesting some removal of Hg° by cloud water, but the physical mechanisms of the removal are yet to be identified., In this paper, we apply the perturbative least-action method to model the Local Group of galaxies for various cosmological models. Our models suggest that the classical timing argument overestimates the true mass of the Local Group system. We further show that although the galaxy masses are theoretically good discriminators of Ω<SUB>M</SUB> given some observed Milky Way and M31 separation and radial velocity, current estimates of the masses are insufficient to make any cosmological claims., A formulation based on defect-generated dissolution stepwaves of the variation of dissolution rate with the degree of undersaturation is validated by near-atomic-scale observations of surfaces, Monte Carlo simulations, and experimental bulk dissolution rates. The dissolution stepwaves emanating from etch pits provide a train of steps similar to those of a spiral but with different behavior. Their role in accounting for the bulk dissolution rate of crystals provides a conceptual framework for mineral dissolution far from equilibrium. Furthermore, the law extends research to conditions closer to equilibrium and predicts a nonlinear decrease in the rate of dissolution as equilibrium is approached, which has implications for understanding artificial and natural processes involving solid-fluid reactions., We argue that a variety of solar data suggest that the activity-cycle timescale variability of the total irradiance is produced by structural adjustments of the solar interior. Assuming these adjustments are induced by variations of internal magnetic fields, we use measurements of the total irradiance and effective temperature over the period from 1978 to 1992 to infer the magnitude and location of the magnetic field. Using an updated stellar evolution model, which includes magnetic fields, we find that the observations can be explained by fields with peak values ranging from 120 to 2.3 kG, located in the convection zone between 0.959 and 0.997 R<SUB>solar</SUB>, respectively. The corresponding maximal radius changes are 17 km when the magnetic field is located at 0.959 R<SUB>solar</SUB> and 3 km when it is located at 0.997 R<SUB>solar</SUB>. At these depths, the W-parameter (defined by ΔlnR/ΔlnL, where R and L are the radius and luminosity) ranges from 0.02 to 0.006. All these predictions are consistent with helioseismology and recent measurements carried out by the Michelson Doppler Imager experiment on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory., A carbon and sulfur isotope mass balance model has been constructed for calculating the variation of atmospheric O <SUB>2</SUB> over Phanerozoic time. In order to obtain realistic O <SUB>2</SUB> levels, rapid sediment recycling and O <SUB>2</SUB>-dependent isotope fractionation have been employed by the modelling. The dependence of isotope fractionation on O <SUB>2</SUB> is based, for carbon, on the results of laboratory photosynthesis experiments and, for sulfur, on the observed relation between oxidation/reduction recycling and S-isotope fractionation during early diagenetic pyrite formation. The range of fractionations used in the modeling agree with measurements of Phanerozoic sediments by others. Results, derived from extensive sensitivity analysis, suggest that there was a positive excursion of O <SUB>2</SUB> to levels as high as 35% during the Permo-Carboniferous. High O <SUB>2</SUB> at this time agrees with independent modeling, based on the abundances of organic matter and pyrite in sediments, and with the occurrence of giant insects during this period. The cause of the excursion is believed to be the rise of vascular land plants and the consequent increased production of O <SUB>2</SUB> by the burial in sediments of lignin-rich organic matter that was resistant to biological decomposition., We study the large-scale spatial distribution of low-redshift quasars and Seyfert 1 galaxies using a sample of 106 luminous emission-line objects (M<SUB>B</SUB>~-23) selected by their Hα emission lines in a far-red objective prism survey (0.2&lt;z&lt;0.37). Of the 106 objects, 25 were previously known active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and follow-up spectroscopy for an additional 53 objects (including all object pairs with separation r&lt;20 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc) confirmed 48 AGNs and 5 narrow emission line galaxies (NELGs). The calculated amplitude of the spatial two-point correlation function for the emission-line sample is A=0.4ξ(r&lt;20 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc)×20<SUP>1.8</SUP>=142+/-53. Eliminating the confirmed NELGs from the sample, we obtain the AGN clustering amplitude A=98+/-54. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we reject the hypothesis that the observed pair counts were drawn from a random distribution at the 99.97% and 98.6% confidence levels for the entire sample and the AGN subset, respectively. We measure a decrease in the quasar clustering amplitude by a factor of 3.7+/-2.0 between z=0.26 and z~1.5, and present the coordinates, redshifts, and follow-up spectroscopy for the 15 previously unknown AGNs and four luminous NELGs that contribute to the clustering signal., We report optical monitoring of the soft X-ray transient XTE J1550-564 during the 1999 season (1999 January 4-August 24). The first optical observations available in 1999 show that the peak ``reflare'' brightness had exceeded the peak brightness of the initial optical flare in 1998 September by over half a magnitude. We compare the optical reflare light curves with the total X-ray flux, the power-law flux, and disk flux light curves constructed from the spectral fits to RXTE/PCA data. During the first 60 days of the observed optical reflare, we find no correspondence between the thermal component of the X-rays often associated with a disk and the optical flux-the former remains essentially flat, whereas the latter declines exponentially and exhibits three substantial dips. However, the power-law flux is anticorrelated with the optical dips, suggesting that the optical flux may be up scattered into the X-ray by the hot corona. Periodic modulations were discovered during the final stage of the outburst (May-June), with P=1.546+/-0.038 days, and during quiescence (July and August), with P=1.540+/-0.008 days. The analysis of the combined data set reveals a strong signal for a unique period at P=1.541+/-0.009 days, which we believe to be the orbital period., We have undertaken a study of the globular cluster (GC) systems of a large sample of elliptical and spiral galaxies in order to test specific predictions of galaxy formation models. Here we present results for the first elliptical in the study, the giant Virgo cluster galaxy NGC 4472 (M49). The galaxy was observed in three filters (BVR) using the wide-field Mosaic Imager on the Kitt Peak 4 m telescope. The Mosaic images roughly double the radial coverage of previous CCD observations of NGC 4472. We have combined the Mosaic data with published spectroscopic data and archival HST observations in order to study NGC 4472's GC system in detail, and to fully characterize the amount of contamination in our sample of GC candidates. We find that the radial profile of the GC system is fit fairly well by a de Vaucouleurs law of the form logσ<SUB>GC</SUB>=(3.38+/-0.08)-(1.56+/-0.05) r<SUP>1/4</SUP> out to 17' (~80 kpc), but that the observed profile falls slightly below the de Vaucouleurs law between 17' and 23', the limit of the data. The bimodal color distribution observed in previous studies is apparent in our data. We find a small metallicity gradient in the inner 8' of the total GC system due to the increasing ratio of blue to red clusters, consistent with results from past studies. The gradient vanishes, however, when the entire radial extent of the data is taken into account. We estimate a total of ~5900 GCs in NGC 4472 out to 23', yielding a specific frequency of 3.6+/-0.6 within this radius. This specific frequency value is smaller than that found by previous studies of NGC 4472. We examine the implications of these results with regard to predictions made by four different galaxy formation models, and we find that all four models have at least one inconsistency with the data., X-ray novae (XNe) are binary systems in which matter is transferred from the companion star onto the compact object through an accretion flow. Besides providing the most compelling evidence for the existence of black holes, XNe present rare opportunities to test general relativity in the strong field limit. Multiwavelength observations, and in particular the correlated features of the multiwavelength light curves, lead to unique information about the accretion geometry, underlying radiative mechanisms, and relevant physical time-scales. The goal of this thesis is to provide extensive multiwavelength observations of XNe, covering entire outburst cycles, which present quantitative challenges to existing theories. By using instruments designed to conduct long term monitoring of XNe, namely the Rossi X ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) satellite and the Yale 1-m telescope (operated by the YALO consortium), we closely studied a black hole XN XTE J1550-564 and a neutron star XN Aquila X-1 in the optical/IR and X-ray wavelengths. We discovered the optical counterpart of XTE J1550 564, measured a preliminary value for its orbital period, detected several correlations and delays between features in the optical and X-ray light, and obtained the first extensive IR light curve from a black hole XN covering an entire outburst cycle. Similarly, we found delays and correlations in the light curves of Aquila X-1. Periodic signatures were found throughout the outburst. Contrary to prior knowledge, we find a ∼2% shorter period during the outburst rise, compared to the value during full outburst. We have also succeeded, for the first time, in triggering pointed RXTE observations of an XN based on the detection of the optical outburst, which typically precedes the X-ray outburst by a week or so. We proposed qualitative explanations for these observations, which, in the absence of detailed theoretical models, serves as a starting point for further theoretical endeavors. The outburst optical/IR and X-ray light curves of the two XN presented in this thesis provide new insight regarding the behavior of XN and offer a rare opportunity to rigorously challenge existing theories., Contents 1 Introduction 2 Theoretical tools 2.1 The method of SO(3) decomposition 2.2 Foliation of the structure function into j-sectors 2.3 The velocity structure functions 2.4 Dimensional estimates for the lowest-order anisotropic scaling exponents 2.5 Summary 3 Some experimental considerations 3.1 Background 3.2 Relevance of the anisotropic contributions 3.3 Themeasurements 4 Anisotropic contribution in the case of homogeneity 4.1 General remarks on the data 4.2 The tensor form for the second-order structure function 4.3 Summary 5 Anisotropic contribution in the case of inhomogeneity 5.1 Extracting the j=1 component 6 The higher-order structure functions 6.1 Introduction 6.2 Method and results 6.3 Summary 7 Conclusions Appendix A Full form for the j=2 contribution for the homogeneous case B The j=1 component in the inhomogeneous case B.1 Antisymmetric contribution B.2 Symmetric contribution C Tests of the robustness of the interpolation formula, , Alignments in the angular momentum vectors of galaxies can induce large scale correlations in their projected orientations. Such alignments arise from the tidal torques exerted on neighboring proto-galaxies by the smoothly varying shear field. Weak gravitational lensing can also induce ellipticity correlations since the images of neighboring galaxies will be distorted coherently by the intervening mass distribution. Comparing these two sources of shape correlations, it is found that for current weak lensing surveys with a median redshift of z<SUP>m</SUP> = 1, the intrinsic signal is a contaminant on the order of 1-10% of the measured signal. However, for shallower surveys with z<SUP>m</SUP> &lt;= 0.3, the intrinsic correlations dominate over the lensing signal. The distortions induced by lensing are curl-free, whereas those resulting from intrinsic alignments are not. This difference can be used to disentangle these two sources of ellipticity correlations. When the distortions are dominated by lensing, as occurs at high redshifts, the decomposition provides a valuable tool for understanding properties of the noise and systematic errors., We discuss broad-band and narrow-band Hubble Space Telescope images of the central region of the heavily disturbed Virgo cluster galaxy NGC 4438, whose nucleus has been described as a type 1 LINER or dwarf Seyfert. Narrow-band H α and [N ii] HST images reveal strikingly asymmetric bipolar shell features, 1 kpc in projected length from end to end, which are likely the result of an outflow from the nuclear region experiencing a strong interaction with the ISM. While these outflow shells share similarities with those in some other starburst or AGN galaxies, these in NGC 4438 are notable because NGC 4438 harbors neither a luminous starburst nor a luminous AGN. We discuss the origin of the outflow, and the influence of the galaxy interaction on the outflow., The junction of the Aleutian Island and the Kamchatka peninsula defines a sharp turn in the boundary of the Pacific and North American plates, terminating the subduction zones of the northwest Pacific. The regional pattern of shear-wave birefringence near the junction indicates that trench-parallel strain follows the seismogenic Benioff zone, but rotates to trench-normal beyond the slab edge. Asthenospheric mantle is inferred to flow around and beneath the disrupted slab edge, and may influence the shallowing dip of the Benioff zone at the Aleutian junction.","['2006AAS...20922301S',
