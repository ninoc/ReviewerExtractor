Their cosmological nature makes them the best tool to explore the final stages in the lives of very massive stars up to the highest redshifts. Furthermore, studying the emission from their low-energy counterparts (optical and infrared) via rapid spectroscopy, we have been able to pin down the exact location of the most distant galaxies as well as placing stringent constraints on their host galaxies and intervening systems at low and high-redshift (e.g. metallicity and neutral hydrogen fraction). In fact, each GRB spectrum contains absorption features imprinted by metals in the host interstellar medium (ISM) as well as the intervening intergalactic medium (IGM) along the line of sight. In this chapter we summarize the progress made using a large dataset of GRB spectra in understanding the nature of both these absorbers and how GRBs can be used to study the early Universe, in particular to measure the neutral hydrogen fraction and the escape fraction of UV photons before and during the epoch of re-ionization., We present our extensive observational campaign on the Swift-discovered GRB 141121A, almost 10 years after its launch. Our observations cover radio through X-rays and extend for more than 30 days after discovery. The prompt phase of GRB 141121A lasted 1410 s and, at the derived redshift of z = 1.469, the isotropic energy is E<SUB>\\u03b3,iso</SUB> = 8.0 \\u00d7 10<SUP>52</SUP> erg. Due to the long prompt duration, GRB 141121A falls into the recently discovered class of ultra-long GRBs (UL-GRBs). Peculiar features of this burst are (1) a flat early-time optical light curve and (2) a radio-to-X-ray rebrightening around three days after the burst. The latter is followed by a steep optical-to-X-ray decay and a much shallower radio fading. We analyze GRB 141121A in the context of the standard forward-reverse shock (FS, RS) scenario and we disentangle the FS and RS contributions. Finally, we comment on the puzzling early-time (t \\u2272 3 days) behavior of GRB 141121A, and suggest that its interpretation may require a two-component jet model. Overall, our analysis confirms that the class of UL-GRBs represents our best opportunity to firmly establish the prominent emission mechanisms in action during powerful gamma-ray burst explosions, and future missions (like SVOM, XTiDE, or ISS-Lobster) will provide many more of such objects., We present the largest, publicly available sample of damped Ly\\u03b1 systems (DLAs) along the lines of sight of Swift-discovered gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in order to investigate the environmental properties of long GRB hosts in the z = 1.8-6 redshift range. Compared with the most recent quasar DLA sample (QSO-DLA), our analysis shows that GRB-DLAs probe a more metal-enriched environment at z\\u2273 3, up to [X/H]\\u223c -0.5. In the z = 2-3 redshift range, despite the large number of lower limits, there are hints that the two populations may be more similar (only at a 90% significance level) than at higher redshifts. Also, at high-z, the GRB-DLA average metallicity seems to decline at a lower rate than the QSO-DLAs: GRB-DLA hosts may be polluted with metals at least as far as \\u223c 2 kpc from the GRB explosion site, probably due to previous star formation episodes and/or supernova explosions. This shallow metallicity trend, now extended up to z\\u223c 5, confirms previous results that GRB hosts are star-forming and have, on average, higher metallicities than the general QSO-DLA population. Finally, our host metallicity measurements are broadly consistent with the predictions derived from the hypothesis of two channels of GRB progenitors, one of which is mildly affected by a metallicity bias, although more data are needed to constrain the models at z\\u2273 4., We present early optical photometry and spectroscopy of the afterglow and host galaxy of the bright short-duration gamma-ray burst GRB 130603B discovered by the Swift satellite. Using our Target of Opportunity program on the Gemini South telescope, our prompt optical spectra reveal a strong trace from the afterglow superimposed on continuum and emission lines from the z = 0.3568 \\u00b1 0.0005 host galaxy. The combination of a relatively bright optical afterglow (r' = 21.52 at \\u0394t = 8.4 hr), together with an observed offset of 0.''9 from the host nucleus (4.8 kpc projected distance at z = 0.3568), allow us to extract a relatively clean spectrum dominated by afterglow light. Furthermore, the spatially resolved spectrum allows us to constrain the properties of the explosion site directly, and compare these with the host galaxy nucleus, as well as other short-duration GRB host galaxies. We find that while the host is a relatively luminous (L \\\\approx 0.8 \\\\,L^{*}_{B}), star-forming (SFR = 1.84 M <SUB>\\u2299</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) galaxy with almost solar metallicity, the spectrum of the afterglow exhibits weak Ca II absorption features but negligible emission features. The explosion site therefore lacks evidence of recent star formation, consistent with the relatively long delay time distribution expected in a compact binary merger scenario. The star formation rate (SFR; both in an absolute sense and normalized to the luminosity) and metallicity of the host are both consistent with the known sample of short-duration GRB hosts and with recent results which suggest GRB 130603B emission to be the product of the decay of radioactive species produced during the merging process of a neutron-star-neutron-star binary (\\\"kilonova\\\"). Ultimately, the discovery of more events similar to GRB 130603B and their rapid follow-up from 8 m class telescopes will open new opportunities for our understanding of the final stages of compact-objects binary systems and provide crucial information (redshift, metallicity, and chemical content of their explosion site) to characterize the environment of one of the most promising gravitational wave sources., In 2006, Prochter et al. reported a statistically significant enhancement of very strong Mg II absorption systems intervening the sight lines to gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) relative to the incidence of such absorption along quasar sight lines. This counterintuitive result has inspired a diverse set of astrophysical explanations (e.g., dust, gravitational lensing) but none of these has obviously resolved the puzzle. Using the largest set of GRB afterglow spectra available, we reexamine the purported enhancement. In an independent sample of GRB spectra with a survey path three times larger than Prochter et al., we measure the incidence per unit redshift of &gt;=1 \\u00c5 rest-frame equivalent width Mg II absorbers at z \\u2248 1 to be l(z) = 0.18 \\u00b1 0.06. This is fully consistent with current estimates for the incidence of such absorbers along quasar sight lines. Therefore, we do not confirm the original enhancement and suggest those results suffered from a statistical fluke. Signatures of the original result do remain in our full sample (l(z) shows an \\u22481.5 enhancement over l(z)<SUB>QSO</SUB>), but the statistical significance now lies at \\u224890% c.l. Restricting our analysis to the subset of high-resolution spectra of GRB afterglows (which overlaps substantially with Prochter et al.), we still reproduce a statistically significant enhancement of Mg II absorption. The reason for this excess, if real, is still unclear since there is no connection between the rapid afterglow follow-up process with echelle (or echellette) spectrographs and the detectability of strong Mg II doublets. Only a larger sample of such high-resolution data will shed some light on this matter., Understanding the origin and diversity of emission processes responsible for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains a pressing challenge. While prompt and contemporaneous panchromatic observations have the potential to test predictions of the internal-external shock model, extensive multiband imaging has been conducted for only a few GRBs. We present rich, early-time, multiband data sets for two Swift events, GRB 110205A and GRB 110213A. The former shows optical emission since the early stages of the prompt phase, followed by the steep rising in flux up to ~1000 s after the burst (t <SUP>-\\u03b1</SUP> with \\u03b1 = -6.13 \\u00b1 0.75). We discuss this feature in the context of the reverse-shock scenario and interpret the following single power-law decay as being forward-shock dominated. Polarization measurements, obtained with the RINGO2 instrument mounted on the Liverpool Telescope, also provide hints on the nature of the emitting ejecta. The latter event, instead, displays a very peculiar optical to near-infrared light curve, with two achromatic peaks. In this case, while the first peak is probably due to the onset of the afterglow, we interpret the second peak to be produced by newly injected material, signifying a late-time activity of the central engine., Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) serve as powerful probes of the early universe, with their luminous afterglows revealing the locations and physical properties of star-forming galaxies at the highest redshifts, and potentially locating first-generation (Population III) stars. Since GRB afterglows have intrinsically very simple spectra, they allow robust redshifts from low signal-to-noise spectroscopy, or photometry. Here we present a photometric redshift of z ~ 9.4 for the Swift detected GRB 090429B based on deep observations with Gemini-North, the Very Large Telescope, and the GRB Optical and Near-infrared Detector. Assuming a Small Magellanic Cloud dust law (which has been found in a majority of GRB sight lines), the 90% likelihood range for the redshift is 9.06 &lt; z &lt; 9.52, although there is a low-probability tail toward somewhat lower redshifts. Adopting Milky Way or Large Magellanic Cloud dust laws leads to very similar conclusions, while a Maiolino law does allow somewhat lower redshift solutions, though in all cases the most likely redshift is found to be z &gt; 7. The non-detection of the host galaxy to deep limits (Y(AB) ~ 28, which would correspond roughly to 0.001L* at z = 1) in our late-time optical and infrared observations with the Hubble Space Telescope strongly supports the extreme-redshift origin of GRB 090429B, since we would expect to have detected any low-z galaxy, even if it were highly dusty. Finally, the energetics of GRB 090429B are comparable to those of other GRBs and suggest that its progenitor is not greatly different from those of lower redshift bursts., Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) represent the sole class of catastrophic phenomena seen over almost the entire history of the Universe. Their extreme luminosities in high energy gamma-ray radiation make them readily detectable, even with relatively small satellite-based detectors, out to the earliest cosmic epochs. Moreover, the brilliance of their fading afterglow light, routinely observed in X-ray, optical, near-infrared, and radio wavelengths, allows them to be exploited -- for hours, days, or weeks -- as cosmic lighthouses, probing the conditions of gas and dust along the line of sight, through their host galaxies and the cosmos at large. Since the November 2004 launch of Swift, this GRB-focused NASA mission has discovered more than 500 GRBs, in almost all cases reporting the burst coordinates to ground-based observers within seconds of the event. The availability of prompt burst positions from Swift, combined with promptly-reported flux measurements from instruments on Swift and an array of ground-based robotic telescopes, have enabled targeted spectroscopic campaigns that have gathered detailed observations of the young, bright afterglows of hundreds of these events. This thesis reports the results of my own efforts over the past 5 years, analyzing imaging and spectroscopic observations of Swift-detected GRBs as triggered according to my own requests, or as gathered from public data archives. In Chapter 2, I discuss our follow-up campaign for GRB090429B, one of our best \\\"extreme redshift\\\" (z &gt; 8) candidates. This burst followed closely on the spectroscopicallyconfirmed z = 8.2 GRB090423, and our multiwavelength observations and SED modeling demonstrate the value and limitation of such studies, in cases where a spectroscopic redshift cannot be gathered in a timely fashion. I also address the importance of such extreme-redshift events from a cosmological perspective. In Chapter 3, I use high-resolution GRB afterglow spectra to study the properties of intervening absorbers along GRB lines of sight, in particular, the \\\"very strong\\\" Mg II absorbers, which are often associated with Damped Lyman-alpha systems. By comparing the properties of the absorbers detected along GRB and quasar lines-of-sight, we attempt to shed light on the mysterious excess of such absorbers in GRB (as compared to quasar) spectra. Carrying out a battery of kinematic and qualitative tests, we fail to identify any respect in which the GRB systems systematically differ from the quasar systems, thus disfavoring the hypothesis that some or many of the GRB absorbers are associated with fast-moving gas in the GRB environs or host galaxy. In Chapter 4, I present a summary of five years of GRB afterglow spectroscopic follow-up efforts, the Gemini catalog of mid-resolution afterglow spectra. This dataset consists of more than 50 GRBs observed with the GMOS instruments on the Gemini North and South telescopes; among these objects, we select 22 high signal-to-noise spectra for comprehensive analysis, reporting equivalent widths and upper or lower limits for a large number of atomic species often observed in absorption in GRB afterglow spectra. Applying these results, we explore the metallicity and dust content of the host galaxies of these GRBs, since these properties likely have important implications for the nature of the progenitors and the characterization of the GRB environment. Finally, in my conclusions, I review what we have learned over the past five years, and address some of the open questions in the use of GRB afterglows as cosmic probes that I expect will attract the greatest attention of researchers over the next few years., The startling discovery by Prochter et al. that the frequency of very strong (W<SUB>r</SUB> (2796)&gt;1 \\u00c5) Mg II absorbers along gamma-ray burst (GRB) lines of sight ([dN/dz]<SUB>GRB</SUB> = 0.90) is more than three times the frequency along quasar lines of sight ([dN/dz]<SUB>QSO</SUB> = 0.24), over similar redshift ranges, has yet to be understood. In particular, explanations appealing to dust antibias in quasar samples, partial covering of the quasar sources, and gravitational-lensing amplification of the GRBs have all been carefully examined and found wanting. We therefore reconsider the possibility that the excess of very strong Mg II absorbers toward GRBs is intrinsic either to the GRBs themselves or to their immediate environment, and associated with bulk outflows with velocities as large as v <SUB>max</SUB> ~ 0.3c. In order to examine this hypothesis, we accumulate a sample of 27 W<SUB>r</SUB> (2796)&gt;1 \\u00c5 absorption systems found toward 81 quasars, and compare their properties to those of 8 W<SUB>r</SUB> (2796) &gt; 1 \\u00c5 absorption systems found toward six GRBs; all systems have been observed at high spectral resolution (R = 45, 000) using the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope. We make multiple comparisons of the absorber properties across the two populations, testing for differences in metallicity, ionization state, abundance patterns, dust abundance, kinematics, and phase structure. We find no significant differences between the two absorber populations using any of these metrics, implying that, if the excess of absorbers along GRB lines of sight are indeed intrinsic, they must be produced by a process which has strong similarities to the processes yielding strong Mg II systems associated with intervening galaxies. Although this may seem a priori unlikely, given the high outflow velocities required for any intrinsic model, we note that the same conclusion was reached, recently, with respect to the narrow absorption line systems seen in some quasars., \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Identifier\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Top 10 Words\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Top 10 Bigrams\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Top 10 Trigrams\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Data Type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Clean\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

For many years it has been funded a wide variety of projects across many institutions, students career stages and nationalities. Inspired by the Astro 2020 DecadalSurvey we implemented changes to the ROSES23 call to increase the success rate of the program (currently at 12% rate) while continue our effort to foster Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Accessibility principles. We will present the current status of the program in Astrophysics in its past and current format, as well as proposed changes for the incoming February 2024 deadline., In recent years, NASA has sought to expand its pool of potential proposal reviewers in an effort to incorporate a new generation of diverse astrophysicists. In response to the Astro2020 Decadal, survey we collected 10+ years of institutional data across many ROSES calls. To improve the diversity of the scientific merit review panels, we have developed a Python-based routine to query NASA ADS API (via a third-party ADS package) and determine the expertise of potential NASA reviewers. Focusing on researchers at Minority Serving Institutions (MSI) and smaller research institutions (\\\"R2s\\\"), we query their names and affiliations. The resultant publication data is processed through a series of customizable filters (e.g. publication years, type, and journal names). Through the relevant paper metadata we extract the author's collection of abstracts and create a series of n-grams that can then be scrutinized to determine the astronomical expertise of the author for consideration by NASA program scientists. The code is made publicly available and has been also modified to run on other user-determined lists (e.g. NHFP, NPP Fellows)., We observed the GRB 230506B (Dichiara et al., GCN 33727) field with the LCOGT 1-meter Sinistro instrument at the Teide Observatory, Tenerife site, on May 7, from 04:09 to 04:41 UT (corresponding to 15.43 to 15.93 hours from the GRB trigger time) with the SDSS r and i filters.

We performed a series of 3x300s exposures in both bands. We detect a source consistent with the XRT enhanced error position (Evens et al., GCN 33261) that is not present in USNO, SkyMapper, or 2MASS catalogs. The coordinates for this candidate are: 238.19844d, -50.917039d. As the field is near the galactic plane, the field is quite crowded. It is possible that this source is present in the catalogs mentioned, but was not able to be resolved due to different plate scales. Future observations are planned to determine if the detected source is fading and other follow-up efforts are encouraged. The following magnitudes are calculated using the USNO-B1.0 catalog as reference: R = 17.75 +/- 0.02 I = 17.16 +/- 0.01 Due to the crowded field, these magnitudes may be contaminated by a nearby bright star.

We performed a series of 3x300s exposures in each band. We do not detect a source in any band at the GIT optical counterpart location (Swain et al., GCN 33269), evidence for additional fading compared to early optical detections (Swain et al., GCN 33269; Smartt et al., GCN 33278; Saccardi et al., GCN 33281; Ror et al., GCN 33284). The following upper limits are calculated using the PanSTARRS catalog as reference: g &gt; 22.0 r &gt; 21.9 i &gt; 21.1 These magnitudes are not corrected for galactic extinction., In 2021, NASA Astrophysics tasked panel to carry out the first evaluation of the NASA Hubble Fellowship Program (NHFP), which has been successfully run for over thirty years. The final report, published in late 2021 resulted in a series of thirty two recommendations aimed at improving several aspects of the NHFP. <P />Immediately after the publication of the review an implementation taskforce was created to implement some of the recommendations and create an assessment and timeline. In the summer 2022, a community feedback form was conducted to gather community input on the prioritization of the report recommendations. Over 100 participants responded to the anonymous community feedback form. Here we present the methodology and preliminary results of the community feedback form and subsequent analysis. <P />The survey was a combination of Likert scale and open-ended questions. Therefore, the analysis included both qualitative and quantitative analysis. The goals of this analysis were twofold. The first was to understand what recommendations the astrophysics community prioritized. The second was to understand if various groups of the community prioritized recommendations differently. While all the responses will be kept anonymous, limited demographic information was collected, including respondent's career stage and institution. This information was the basis for the comparative analysis. I analyzed differences in responses based on career stage and type of institution Using the weighted means of the Likert scale data, comparative analysis showed there are differences in how these groups prioritize recommendations. <P />The qualitative data was analyzed to further investigate the reason behind people's rankings. This stage of analysis was done through inductive coding, in which I identified main themes and patterns within the data. While the qualitative data was not as robust as the quantitative, it provided information about why people liked or disliked recommendations and provided ideas for further research into how to implement the NHFP review board's recommendations., We observed the GRB 230123A (Williams et al., GCN 33206) field with the LCOGT 1-meter Sinistro instrument at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory, Chile site, on January 24, from 02:06 to 02:38 UT (corresponding to 15.78 to 16.32 hours from the GRB trigger time) with the Bessel R and I filters.

The review presented a comprehensive analysis of the program objectives and outcomes and made thirty two recommendations in order to align the NHFP with NASA core values and improve the program overall within the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century status of the profession. This project focuses on a further analysis of all NHFP recipients and a comparative effort with the NASA Postdoctoral Program fellowship. <P />We had three main goals: 1) collecting up-to-date data on past NHFP and NPP recipients including their past location, fellowship location, and current position and institutions; 2) analyzing historical trends, and 3) presenting geographical data that may help future and current fellows to engage the astronomical community. We present the data collection, categorization, and curation of the past 30 years of NHFP fellows and 15 years of NPPs. The final products of this project include an interactive map of academic institutions that hosts fellows and a proximity analysis with less research intensive and minority serving institutions., We observed the GRB 230116D (Sonbas et al., GCN 33176) field with the LCOGT 1-meter Sinistro instrument at the McDonald Observatory, TX, USA site, on January 17, from 05:24 to 05:56 UT (corresponding to 8.33 to 8.64 hours from the GRB trigger time) with the SDSS r and i filters.

We do not detect an optical counterpart within the XRT enhanced error region (Goad et al., GCN 32333) in either band, consistent with other non-detections (Gendre et al., GCN 32331; Lipunov et al., GCN 32332; Jiang et al., GCN 32335; de Ugarte-Postigo et al., GCN 32338; Guelbenzu et al., GCN 32339).

R.S. is funded by NSF AST grant #1831682, The current data acquisition rate of astronomical transient surveys and the promise for significantly higher rates in the next decade necessitate the development of novel approaches to analyze astronomical data sets and promptly detect objects of interest. The Deeper, Wider, Faster (DWF) program is a survey focused on the identification of fast-evolving transients, such as fast radio bursts, gamma-ray bursts, and supernova shock breakouts. It employs multi-frequency simultaneous coverage of the same part of the sky over several orders of magnitude. Using the Dark Energy Camera mounted on the 4 m Blanco telescope, DWF captures a 20 s g-band exposure every minute, at a typical seeing of ~1\\\" and an air mass of ~1.5. These optical data are collected simultaneously with observations conducted over the entire electromagnetic spectrum\\u2014from radio to \\u03b3-rays\\u2014as well as cosmic-ray observations. In this paper, we present a novel real-time light-curve analysis algorithm, designed to detect transients in the DWF optical data; this algorithm functions independently from, or in conjunction with, image subtraction. We present a sample of fast transients detected by our algorithm, as well as a false-positive analysis. Our algorithm is customizable and can be tuned to be sensitive to transients evolving over different timescales and flux ranges., We observed GRB 220521A (Dicharia et al., GCN 32076; Fermi GBM Team, GCN 32075) with the LCO 1-m Sinistro instrument at the Teide Observatory, Tenerife site, on May 22, from 00:04 to 00:32 UT (corresponding to 0.73 to 1.20 hours from the GRB trigger time) with the Bessel R and I filters. We performed a series of 3x300s exposures in R and I bands. We detect an optical counterpart at the NOT optical afterglow location (Malesani et al., 32078 GCN 32078) that is consistent with other optical detections (Malesani et al., GCN 32078; Fynbo et al., GCN 32079; Goranskij et al., GCN 32082). The following magnitudes are calculated using the USNO-B.1 catalog as reference: R=21.57+/-0.23 I=18.61+/-0.63 These magnitudes are not corrected for galactic extinction. R.S. is funded by NSF AST grant #1831682, On May 22.16 UT (T0+4.5 hr after the GRB) we observed the afterglow, of GRB 220521A (Fermi GBM team, GCN 32075; Dichiara et al., GCN 32076; Poolakkil &amp; Meegan, GCN 32089; Strausbaugh et al., GCN 32091) with the Gemini-South telescope and the GMOS camera. We performed a series of spectroscopic observations with the R400 grating centered at 7500 AA (2x600 s) and 8100 AA (2x600 s). Observations were obtained at an average airmass of 2.34. In our 300 s, z-band acquisition image we detected the GRB counterpart at the NOT optical afterglow location (Malesani et al., GCN 32078). In our preliminary analysis we measured z (AB)=20.9 +/- 0.3, calibrated against 10 PS1 stars. No extinction correction has been applied. Our visual inspection of the spectroscopic data confirms the redshift reported by Fynbo et al. (GCN 32079) as z=5.57 based on the detection of Lyman alpha, SiIV and Ni lines. Combined with the results from MMT (Rastinejad et al., GCN 32097)we derive a decay index in z-band of alpha=1.57, consistent with the current X-ray behavior (Tohuvavohu et al., GCN 32086). Further analysis is in progress. We thank the Gemini-S staff, particularly Javier Fuentes and Veronica Firpo, for conducting these observations., We observed Swift GRB220427A (D'Ai et al.

We performed a series of 3x300s exposures in I and R bands. We detect an optical counterpart at the location of the Swift optical counterpart that is consistent with other optical detections (Ugarte Postigo, et al., GCN 31967; Klotz, et al., GCN 31991).

We performed a series of 3x300s exposures in I and R bands. We do not detect an optical counterpart within the XRT enhanced error region (Goad et al., GCN 31771) in either band, consistent with the non-detection from Mondy (Belkin et. al, GCN 31773).

R.S. is funded by NSF AST grant #1831682, The recently discovered GRB 210905A is the highest redshift GRB for which an early, high-S/N, mid-high resolution afterglow spectrum has been obtained. In addition to providing the redshift, this spectrum exhibits numerous metal lines and a complex velocity structure spanning ~360 km/s, and blueshifted by ~1000 km/s from a tentative Ly-a emission line. Modelling of the Lyman-alpha damping wing reveals the host column density, and puts constraints on the neutral fraction of the surrounding intergalactic medium. Analysis of the abundances gives an average metallicity Z~Zsol/20. In addition, the afterglow of this GRB started bright and has declined slowly, implying a late jet break. This suggests a wide jet and hence a particularly high energy event, perhaps indicative of an unusual progenitor star. Here we seek HST WFC3/IR F140W imaging to obtain a final late-time point on the afterglow light curve to constrain any break, and an image after the afterglow has faded, to provide a subtraction template and characterisation of the host galaxy. This would make it the first galaxy at z&gt;6 detected in emission for which detailed absorption line abundances for multiple species are available., We observed Swift GRB 220325A (Ferro et al., GCN 31787) with the LCO 1-m Sinistro instrument at the McDonald Observatory, Texas, USA site, on March 26, from 09:25 to 09:53 UT (corresponding to 16.15 to 16.62 hours from the GRB trigger time) with the Bessel R and I filters.

Using the USNO-B.1 catalog as reference, we calculate the following magnitudes: R = 19.00 +/- 0.02 I = 17.70 +/- 0.03 These magnitudes are not corrected for galactic extinction. The fainter R magnitude could indicate a moderately high redshift.

We performed a series of 5x60s exposures in R and I. We clearly detect an optical source in R and I band in stacked images at a location consistent the initial UVOT detection (Lien, GCN 29420). Using the USNO-B.1 catalog as reference, we calculate the following magnitudes: R = 20.24 +/- 0.13 I = 20.56 +/- 0.24 These magnitudes are not corrected for galactic extinction.

The magnitudes of this source are the following: R = 22.57 +/- 0.29 I &gt; 20.39 A second source, which is located at ra, dec=(00:22:43.69,-00:16:57.37), 1.08 arcesonds from the center of the XRT localization is likely consistent with the potential host galaxy and magnitude were reported in GCN 27792. At this moment it is not possible to determine if any of these objects is related to the short GRB 200522A, but further observations have been scheduled to determine possible variability.

Over a thousand GRBs are detected per year. In order to detect GRBs, the University of the Virgin Islands (UVI) is building the UVI-GREAT (Gamma-Ray Experiment for Astrophysical Transients) CubeSat. CubeSat satellites are nanosatellites of a mass between 1 to 10 kg, it is made up of multiples of 10 cm x 10 cm x11.35 cm cubic units. The UVI-GREAT includes a scintillator, a photomultiplier, and a small computer that will help us detect and notify GRBs. My project goal is to test different scintillators energy resolutions using different radioactive elements. Our aim is to determine which scintillator will be best of use to observe Gamma-ray Burts based on their energy range. To test the different components, we had to create a light-tight box that is basically a black box that must be completely dark inside. The scintillator needs a dark and spacious environment similar to space conditions. In order to detect GRBs the scintillator must be sensitive to gamma-rays and when it happens it emits optical light. The scintillator will be placed in the light-tight box and the light that it emits will be captured by the CCD (digital camera). In order to simulate gamma-rays coming from space, we used radioactive elements and scintillators of different types. We tested all of them to determine the scintillators energy resolution and which one will be more appropriate to fly on UVI-GREAT. The radioactive elements that we tested are Ba-133, Co-60, Cs-137, and Na-22. Each element is different than the other: for example, once the scintillator and the radioactive element are placed in the light-tight box the scintillator will detect some elements but not all. If 30 Kev (kiloelectronvolts) is detected by the scintillator and not 600 Kev then if that scintillator is sent to space we will not be able to identify GRBs with 600 Kev. We will choose the scintillator that gives us the largest energy resolution., We observed Fermi GRB 191011A (Fermi GBM Team at MSFC/Fermi-GBM, GCN 25987) with the LCO 1-m Sinistro instrument at the Cerro Tololo site on October 11, from 04:54 to 05:18 UT (corresponding to 0.13 to 0.4 hours from the GRB trigger time) with the Bessel I filter.

Though traditionally a liberal arts university, UVI has responded to an increase in demand for course offerings in the physical sciences and engineering by establishing a bachelor of science in physics program with a concentration in astronomy. This B.S. program is a first of its kind for UVI. Students enrolled as physics majors are engaged from the earliest possible point in their academic career in research activities. The program was established in 2017 and is preparing to graduate UVI's first-ever class of physics majors in spring of 2019. Prior to development of the UVI physics degree program, students interested in physics, astronomy, or engineering could begin their education at UVI but were required to transfer to a partner school in the mainland US to complete upper-division courses and finish their degree. The UVI physics program was developed as an alternative degree that can be completed entirely at UVI at a greatly reduced financial cost and in a familiar environment. The UVI physics program also develops a highly trained undergraduate research workforce that supports faculty research and improves UVI's research capacity and competitiveness in future research proposals. A key component of the UVI physics program is UVI's Etelman Observatory which serves as a primary research instrument and student training center. The Etelman Observatory is home to UVI's Virgin Islands Robotic Telescope (VIRT), an 0.5m robotic telescope. Together with a detector development and cubesat laboratory, these hands-on research facilities offer UVI physics and engineering students unusual levels of hands-on engineering and research activities throughout their academic careers at UVI. We detail the development of the UVI Physics program, highlight successes from the first 2 years, and look forward to potential areas of growth and collaboration between UVI and its research and education partners., The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is loosely defined as diffuse gas surrounding the galaxies within the virial radius (out to 100 to 300 kpc) and acts as the site of various galactic phenomena such as : galactic winds, outflows, accretion flows, and recycling flows. Promising theoretical and observational studies have suggested that a large fraction of the metals in the universe is stored in the CGM reservoirs around galaxies. Recent space- and ground-based studies of the CGM using bright background quasars have revealed a dynamic interplay between the galaxy ecosystem and surrounding CGM. In this study, we extend this investigation of the CGM to higher redshifts (z &gt; 2) by using the bright afterglows of gamma-ray bursts as background sources. Thanks to their bright UV/optical/NIR afterglows, promptly acquired spectroscopic data show exquisite absorption lines from both the CGM and interstellar medium (ISM) of the GRB host galaxy along the line of sight traced by the afterglow light. We will present results from the analysis of 27 high-resolution (R &gt; 8000) and high signal-to-noise (typical S/N ~ 15) spectra of GRB afterglows covering a redshift range of z ~ 2 to 6. By analyzing the transitions in low and high ionization states, we infer the kinematic and physical properties of the gas in cool and warm phases of the CGM. Our preliminary analysis suggests that the mass of the gas in the warm phase of the CGM around the GRB hosts at z &gt; 2 is roughly half the typical stellar mass of the GRB hosts (~ 10^9 solar mass). Through this study we establish GRB afterglows as one of the key probes of CGM evolution through the cosmic history., , The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is the site of various galactic phenomena such as galactic winds, outflows, accretion flows, and recycling flows. Recent space- and ground-based studies of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) using bright background quasars have revealed a dynamic interplay between the galaxy ecosystem and surrounding CGM. In this study, we extend this investigation of the CGM to higher redshifts (z &gt; 2) by using the bright afterglows of gamma-ray bursts as background sources. Thanks to their bright UV/optical/NIR afterglows, promptly acquired spectroscopic data show exquisite absorption lines from both the CGM and interstellar medium (ISM) of the GRB host galaxy along the line of sight traced by the afterglow light. We compiled a sample of 27 high-resolution (R &gt; 8000) and high signal-to-noise (typical S/N ~ 15) spectra of GRB afterglows covering a redshift range of z ~ 2 to 6, with six of them at z &gt; 4. The column densities (N), Doppler parameters (b) and line-centroids of both high-ionization (O VI, C IV, Si IV, N V) and low-ionization species (Si II, C II*, Fe II, etc) are extracted to study the kinematics of different phases in the CGM. We observed an excess absorption in the blue wings of high-ion absorption features, unlike the typical symmetrical distribution of the low-ion absorption features. In addition, the column density ratios of high- to low-ion lines clearly show the existence of three absorption regimes: a) blueward of -100 km/s, b) within +/-100 km/s and c) redward of 100 km/s. We hypothesize that these populations are: a) predominantly warm CGM outflows at high velocity, b) a combination of CGM at low-velocity and galaxy ISM, and c) cool CGM inflows, respectively. We use a toy-model to corroborate the outflow signatures in GRB afterglow spectra and estimate the CGM mass, assuming a typical GRB host galaxy. Through this study, we establish that GRB afterglows are crucial probes of CGM evolution at high redshifts., \\\"On June 13.84 UT (T_0 +4.5 hours) we began observing the center of the field of GRB 180613A (Tohuvavohu et al. GCN 22769, Beardmore et al. GCN 22773) using the Las Cumbres Observatory 1m telescope located South Africa Astronomical Observatory. We performed a series of 5x120s observations in SDSS-i' and SDSS-r' band for a total of 20 minutes on sky. In the full median stacked i'-band images we clearly identified the NIR counterpart reported by Thoene et al. (GCN #2275, #22820). This object is also marginally detected in our r' band stack. We estimate the following brightness for the optical counterpart: i' = 19.3 +- 0.6 We caution the usage of this measurement due to the high sky background near the GRB location caused by the presence of the nearby by a nearby 5.6 mag star (Schady et al. GCN #22777). This magnitude is calibrated against nearby UCAC4 sources, and is not corrected for Galactic extinction.\\\", , The Deeper Wider Faster (DWF) survey aims to find and classify the fastest transients in the Universe. DWF utilizes the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), collecting a continuous sequence of 20s images over a 3 square degree field of view.Once an interesting transient is detected during DWF observations, the DWF collaboration has access to several facilities for rapid follow-up in multiple wavelengths (from gamma to radio).An online web tool has been designed to help with real-time visual classification of possible astrophysical transients in data collected by the DWF observing program. The goal of this project is to create a python-based code to improve the classification process by querying several existing archive databases. Given the DWF transient location and search radius, the developed code will extract a list of possible counterparts and all available information (e.g. magnitude, radio fluxes, distance separation).Thanks to this tool, the human classifier can make a quicker decision in order to trigger the collaboration rapid-response resources., We observed the field of SSS17a (Coulter et al., GCN 21529; Allam et al., GCN 21530; Yang et al., GCN 21531), the potential counterpart of the LIGO/Virgo event G298048 (GCN 21509), with the 0.5m Virgin Island Robotic Telescope (VIRT) on August the 19th, starting at 23:19 UT. We performed a series of exposures in the R and Clear filters, with an elevation decreasing from 40 degrees. The weather conditions were good, with a mean seeing of 2-3 arcsec. We detect an excess at the position of the potential counterpart in C filter at 23:54 UT. Strong contamination from the nearby galaxy prevents a precise brightness estimate without galaxy substraction. Further analysis is in progress. The VIRT is still in its commissioning phase. This message can be cited., \\\"On June 1.00 UT (T_0 +2.0h) we began observing the center of the field of GRB 170531B (Evans et al. GCN 211171) using the Las Cumbres Observatory 1m Sutherland facility. We performed a series of 10x60s observations in R and I band for a total of 10 minutes on sky in each filter. Seeing conditions were poor. We identified no optical counterpart within the center of Swift-XRT refined position (Evans et al. GCN 21175), or at the location of the identified counterpart (Lipunov et al. GCN 21173, Pozanenko et al. GCN 21174, Schady et al. GCN 21178) at the following 3-sigma limits: R &gt; 19.9 mag I &gt; 19.6 mag These magnitude are calibrated against nearby USNO-B1 sources, and are not corrected for Galactic extinction.\\\", \\\"On May 10 at 16:46 UT (T_0 +11.4h) we began observing the center of the field of LAT GRB 170510A (Bissaldi et al. GCN #21080) using the Las Cumbres Observatory 1m Sutherland facility. We covered 50% of the LAT error region and we obtained a series of 5x120s observations in R band, for a total of 10 minutes on sky. We identified a possible optical counterpart of GRB170510A located at the same position of candidate #1 from the Swift-XRT tiled observations (Evans et al. GCN #21082, Melandri et al. GCN #21086). Our preliminary photometry for this source is: R = 19.6 +/- 0.2 mag At the moment we cannot establish the temporal variability of this source. This magnitude is calibrated against nearby USNO-B1 sources, and is not corrected for Galactic Extinction.\\\", , , , , , , , , We present a sample of 45 Damped Ly\\u03b1 system (DLA; {N}<SUB>{{H</SUB>}{{I}}} \\u2265slant 2\\u00d7 {10}<SUP>20</SUP> {{cm}}<SUP>-2</SUP>) counterparts (33 detections, 12 upper limits) which host gamma-ray bursts (GRB-DLAs) in order to investigate star formation and metallicity within galaxies hosting DLAs. Our sample spans z\\u223c 2{--}6 and is nearly three times larger than any previously detected DLA counterparts survey based on quasar line-of-sight searches (QSO-DLAs). We report star formation rates (SFRs) from rest-frame UV photometry and spectral energy distribution modeling. We find that DLA counterpart SFRs are not correlated with either redshift or H I column density. Thanks to the combination of Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based observations, we also investigate DLA host star formation efficiency. Our GRB-DLA counterpart sample spans both higher efficiency and low efficiency star formation regions compared to the local Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, local star formation laws, and z\\u223c 3 cosmological simulations. We also compare the depletion times of our DLA hosts sample to other objects in the local universe; our sample appears to deviate from the star formation efficiencies measured in local spiral and dwarf galaxies. Furthermore, we find similar efficiencies as local inner disks, SMC, and Lyman-break galaxy outskirts. Finally, our enrichment time measurements show a spread of systems with under- and over-abundance of metals, which may suggest that these systems had episodic star formation and a metal enrichment/depletion as a result of strong stellar feedback and/or metal inflow/outflow., Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) are the most powerful explosions known, capable of outshining the rest of gamma-ray sky during their short-lived prompt emission. Their cosmological nature makes them the best tool to explore the final stages in the lives of very massive stars up to the highest redshifts. Furthermore, studying the emission from their low-energy counterparts (optical and infrared) via rapid spectroscopy, we have been able to pin down the exact location of the most distant galaxies as well as placing stringent constraints on their host galaxies and intervening systems at low and high-redshift (e.g. metallicity and neutral hydrogen fraction). In fact, each GRB spectrum contains absorption features imprinted by metals in the host interstellar medium (ISM) as well as the intervening intergalactic medium (IGM) along the line of sight. In this chapter we summarize the progress made using a large dataset of GRB spectra in understanding the nature of both these absorbers and how GRBs can be used to study the early Universe, in particular to measure the neutral hydrogen fraction and the escape fraction of UV photons before and during the epoch of re-ionization., We present a Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph spectrum of ASASSN-14li, the first rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of a tidal disruption flare (TDF). The underlying continuum is well fit by a blackbody with {T}<SUB>{UV</SUB>}=3.5\\u00d7 {10}<SUP>4</SUP> K, an order of magnitude smaller than the temperature inferred from X-ray spectra (and significantly more precise than previous efforts based on optical and near-UV photometry). Superimposed on this blue continuum, we detect three classes of features: narrow absorption from the Milky Way (probably a high-velocity cloud), and narrow absorption and broad (\\u223c2000-8000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) emission lines at or near the systemic host velocity. The absorption lines are blueshifted with respect to the emission lines by \\u0394v = -(250-400) km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Due both to this velocity offset and the lack of common low-ionization features (Mg II, Fe II), we argue these arise from the same absorbing material responsible for the low-velocity outflow discovered at X-ray wavelengths. The broad nuclear emission lines display a remarkable abundance pattern: N III], N IV], and He II are quite prominent, while the common quasar emission lines of C III] and Mg II are weak or entirely absent. Detailed modeling of this spectrum will help elucidate fundamental questions regarding the nature of the emission processes at work in TDFs, while future UV spectroscopy of ASASSN-14li would help to confirm (or refute) the previously proposed connection between TDFs and \\u201cN-rich\\u201d quasars., More than 60 GRBs at z &gt;~ 1.5 reside in the vicinity of dense, cold gas as probed by the measured neutral hydrogen via afterglow absorption spectroscopy. We present the largest sample of GRB-DLAs to date in comparison with a sample of DLAs along quasars: the metallicity of the GRB hosts represents a unique tool to understand if this particular subset of galaxies can be the key ingredient for GRB formation (and massive stars) at any redshift as well as the overall cosmic star-formation rate. We show that GRB-DLAs live in a metal enriched environment, especially at z &gt;~ 4, likely the result of recent intense star formation and/or SNe episodes. We also derive that our metallicity measurements are broadly consistent with a mild metallicity bias for the GRB formation., , , , , , , , , We present our extensive observational campaign on the Swift-discovered GRB 141121A, almost 10 years after its launch. Our observations cover radio through X-rays and extend for more than 30 days after discovery. The prompt phase of GRB 141121A lasted 1410 s and, at the derived redshift of z = 1.469, the isotropic energy is E<SUB>\\u03b3,iso</SUB> = 8.0 \\u00d7 10<SUP>52</SUP> erg. Due to the long prompt duration, GRB 141121A falls into the recently discovered class of ultra-long GRBs (UL-GRBs). Peculiar features of this burst are (1) a flat early-time optical light curve and (2) a radio-to-X-ray rebrightening around three days after the burst. The latter is followed by a steep optical-to-X-ray decay and a much shallower radio fading. We analyze GRB 141121A in the context of the standard forward-reverse shock (FS, RS) scenario and we disentangle the FS and RS contributions. Finally, we comment on the puzzling early-time (t \\u2272 3 days) behavior of GRB 141121A, and suggest that its interpretation may require a two-component jet model. Overall, our analysis confirms that the class of UL-GRBs represents our best opportunity to firmly establish the prominent emission mechanisms in action during powerful gamma-ray burst explosions, and future missions (like SVOM, XTiDE, or ISS-Lobster) will provide many more of such objects., More than 60 GRBs at z&gt;1.5 reside in the vicinity of dense, cold gas as probed by the measured neutral hydrogen via afterglow absorption spectroscopy. We present the largest sample of GRB-DLAs to date in comparison with a sample of DLAs along quasars: the metallicity of the GRB hosts represents a unique tool to understand if this particular subset of galaxies can be the key ingredient for GRB formation (and massive stars) at any redshift as well as the overall cosmic star-formation rate. We show that GRB-DLAs live in a metal enriched environment, especially at z&gt;4, likely the result of recent intense star formation and/or SNe episodes. We also derive that our metallicity measurements are broadly consistent with a mild metallicity bias for the GRB formation., We present the largest, publicly available sample of damped Ly\\u03b1 systems (DLAs) along the lines of sight of Swift-discovered gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in order to investigate the environmental properties of long GRB hosts in the z = 1.8-6 redshift range. Compared with the most recent quasar DLA sample (QSO-DLA), our analysis shows that GRB-DLAs probe a more metal-enriched environment at z\\u2273 3, up to [X/H]\\u223c -0.5. In the z = 2-3 redshift range, despite the large number of lower limits, there are hints that the two populations may be more similar (only at a 90% significance level) than at higher redshifts. Also, at high-z, the GRB-DLA average metallicity seems to decline at a lower rate than the QSO-DLAs: GRB-DLA hosts may be polluted with metals at least as far as \\u223c 2 kpc from the GRB explosion site, probably due to previous star formation episodes and/or supernova explosions. This shallow metallicity trend, now extended up to z\\u223c 5, confirms previous results that GRB hosts are star-forming and have, on average, higher metallicities than the general QSO-DLA population. Finally, our host metallicity measurements are broadly consistent with the predictions derived from the hypothesis of two channels of GRB progenitors, one of which is mildly affected by a metallicity bias, although more data are needed to constrain the models at z\\u2273 4., , The study of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows, host galaxies, and associated supernovae (SNe) sheds light on a wide range of open questions in astrophysics, ranging from the deaths of massive stars to cosmic chemical enrichment and the reionization epoch, and soon, the electromagnetic (EM) counterparts of gravitational wave (GW) sources. Over the past decade, Gemini has played a leading role in all aspects of GRB science through its combination of rapid-response spectroscopy and imaging coupled with deep late-time host galaxy, afterglow, and GRB-SN follow-up. Here, we propose to step forward in our long-standing program of ToO observations, with this proposal focusing on \\\"Standard ToO\\\" science, enabled by observations at t &gt;1 day. In conjunction with an array of multi-wavelength EM facilities, we focus on three key science topics: (1) Aggressive imaging and spectroscopic campaigns to discover and characterize the associated supernovae of the lowest-redshift (z &lt; 0.5) GRBs; (2) Characterizing host galaxy environments and gathering extended light curves for short GRBs, as candidate compact binary merger events, for connection with forthcoming GW facilities; and (3) Gathering extended light curves of exceptionally energetic bursts detected by the Fermi-LAT instrument, to measure the degree of collimation and total energy release of these events. We also submitted a long-term proposal which will supersede this single-semester request in case of approval., The first billion years of the Universe have been studied extensively via Lyman-break galaxy surveysat great expense of HST time, providing the first detection of z~10 galaxies and the characterization of star-formation rate during re-ionization.Despite these results, the evolution of the chemical content (in neutral or ionized form), theidentification of the first stars and of the more abundant faint, dwarf galaxies at z&gt;~7 are, and will probably be, out of reach for several years to come.Thanks to the capabilities of the Swift mission, the detection of the first Gamma-ray Burst (GRB) at z=8.2 provides a new way to explore the z=6-15 regime. In the past 10 years, the synergybetween a versatile, multi-frequency, rapid-response mission like Swift and the ground based community enabled the detection of primordial GRBs, the study of the neutral IGM via GRB afterglow spectra during the reionization time, and the study of the metal enrichment of the ISM within the first galaxies. I will review these milestones and present the current status of the mission and its connection with several NIR-focused telescope facilities in the prospect of the ``the New Worlds, New Horizon\\\" Decadal survey.In particular, the advent of TMT will sign a new chapter of the high redshift Universe exploration, which will greatly benefit by the current and future successes of Swift and the forthcoming time-domain dedicated missions., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , We present early optical photometry and spectroscopy of the afterglow and host galaxy of the bright short-duration gamma-ray burst GRB 130603B discovered by the Swift satellite. Using our Target of Opportunity program on the Gemini South telescope, our prompt optical spectra reveal a strong trace from the afterglow superimposed on continuum and emission lines from the z = 0.3568 \\u00b1 0.0005 host galaxy. The combination of a relatively bright optical afterglow (r' = 21.52 at \\u0394t = 8.4 hr), together with an observed offset of 0.''9 from the host nucleus (4.8 kpc projected distance at z = 0.3568), allow us to extract a relatively clean spectrum dominated by afterglow light. Furthermore, the spatially resolved spectrum allows us to constrain the properties of the explosion site directly, and compare these with the host galaxy nucleus, as well as other short-duration GRB host galaxies. We find that while the host is a relatively luminous (L \\\\approx 0.8 \\\\,L^{*}_{B}), star-forming (SFR = 1.84 M <SUB>\\u2299</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) galaxy with almost solar metallicity, the spectrum of the afterglow exhibits weak Ca II absorption features but negligible emission features. The explosion site therefore lacks evidence of recent star formation, consistent with the relatively long delay time distribution expected in a compact binary merger scenario. The star formation rate (SFR; both in an absolute sense and normalized to the luminosity) and metallicity of the host are both consistent with the known sample of short-duration GRB hosts and with recent results which suggest GRB 130603B emission to be the product of the decay of radioactive species produced during the merging process of a neutron-star-neutron-star binary (\\\"kilonova\\\"). Ultimately, the discovery of more events similar to GRB 130603B and their rapid follow-up from 8 m class telescopes will open new opportunities for our understanding of the final stages of compact-objects binary systems and provide crucial information (redshift, metallicity, and chemical content of their explosion site) to characterize the environment of one of the most promising gravitational wave sources., The study of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows, host galaxies, and associated supernovae (SNe) sheds light on a wide range of open questions in astrophysics, ranging from the deaths of massive stars to cosmic chemical enrichment and the reionization epoch, and soon, the electromagnetic (EM) counterparts of gravitational wave (GW) sources. Over the past decade, Gemini has played a leading role in all aspects of GRB science through its combination of rapid-response spectroscopy and imaging coupled with deep late-time host galaxy, afterglow, and GRB-SN follow-up. Here, we propose to step forward in our long-standing program of ToO observations, with this proposal focusing on \\\"Standard ToO\\\" science, enabled by observations at t &gt;\\u223c 1 day. In conjunction with an array of multi-wavelength EM facilities, we focus on three key science topics: (1) Aggressive imaging and spectroscopic campaigns to discover and characterize the associated supernovae of the lowest-redshift (z &lt; 0.5) GRBs; (2) Characterizing host galaxy environments and gathering extended light curves for short GRBs, as candidate compact binary merger events, for connection with forthcoming GW facilities; and (3) Gathering extended light curves of exceptionally energetic bursts detected by the Fermi-LAT instrument, to measure the degree of collimation and total energy release of these events., In 2006, Prochter et al. reported a statistically significant enhancement of very strong Mg II absorption systems intervening the sight lines to gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) relative to the incidence of such absorption along quasar sight lines. This counterintuitive result has inspired a diverse set of astrophysical explanations (e.g., dust, gravitational lensing) but none of these has obviously resolved the puzzle. Using the largest set of GRB afterglow spectra available, we reexamine the purported enhancement. In an independent sample of GRB spectra with a survey path three times larger than Prochter et al., we measure the incidence per unit redshift of &gt;=1 \\u00c5 rest-frame equivalent width Mg II absorbers at z \\u2248 1 to be l(z) = 0.18 \\u00b1 0.06. This is fully consistent with current estimates for the incidence of such absorbers along quasar sight lines. Therefore, we do not confirm the original enhancement and suggest those results suffered from a statistical fluke. Signatures of the original result do remain in our full sample (l(z) shows an \\u22481.5 enhancement over l(z)<SUB>QSO</SUB>), but the statistical significance now lies at \\u224890% c.l. Restricting our analysis to the subset of high-resolution spectra of GRB afterglows (which overlaps substantially with Prochter et al.), we still reproduce a statistically significant enhancement of Mg II absorption. The reason for this excess, if real, is still unclear since there is no connection between the rapid afterglow follow-up process with echelle (or echellette) spectrographs and the detectability of strong Mg II doublets. Only a larger sample of such high-resolution data will shed some light on this matter., GRBs provide a unique window on exotic, highly relativistic physics. Our discovery of cosmic explosions like GRB090423 at z=8.2, breaking the record for the most distant known object, also demonstrates the power of using GRBs as lighthouses visible into the epoch of re-ionization, pinpointing the earliest stars and galaxies. Therefore, we intend (i) to observe GRBs at very high-z, in order to explore the IGM during reionization and place fundamental constraints on the early epochs of star-formation; (ii) to study in detail the class of short-duration bursts, especially their electromagnetic signatures in relation to gravitational-wave sources; (iii) to observe exceptionally energetic bursts, such as detected by the Fermi-LAT satellite in order to test theories of quantum gravity; (iv) continue our quest for low-z GRBs associated with supernovae, which, in conjunction with a larger sample of GRB afterglow spectra will provide unique insights into the stellar progenitors and explosion sites of these intriguing phenomena. Gemini, with its flexible schedule and instrumentation suite, represents a cornerstone facility of global GRB research and we will continue to use it in combination with a large network of other facilities., We propose to make late-time observations of gamma-ray burst (GRB) counterparts, complementary to our companion \\\"Rapid ToO\\\" program. High priority science goals include (a) monitoring of low-redshift (z&lt; 0.5) GRBs to search for photometric or spectroscopic evidence of (or place limits on) emission from accompanying supernovae; (b) observations to help confirm and characterize high-redshift GRB candidates, which, led by our Gemini observations, are providing a unique new window on z&gt;6 star formation and the reionization of the Universe; (c) observations of short-duration bursts, which are likely connected to compact object mergers; and (d) afterglow monitoring for \\\"jet break\\\" burst-collimation measurements, to constrain the total energy output for the highest energy bursts detected by Fermi-LAT. We emphasize that our long-running Gemini campaign, which has allowed us to respond flexibly to rare GRB events, has been very successful and has contributed an essential legacy for Swift: late-time observations have been a key component of this., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Understanding the origin and diversity of emission processes responsible for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains a pressing challenge. While prompt and contemporaneous panchromatic observations have the potential to test predictions of the internal-external shock model, extensive multiband imaging has been conducted for only a few GRBs. We present rich, early-time, multiband data sets for two Swift events, GRB 110205A and GRB 110213A. The former shows optical emission since the early stages of the prompt phase, followed by the steep rising in flux up to ~1000 s after the burst (t <SUP>-\\u03b1</SUP> with \\u03b1 = -6.13 \\u00b1 0.75). We discuss this feature in the context of the reverse-shock scenario and interpret the following single power-law decay as being forward-shock dominated. Polarization measurements, obtained with the RINGO2 instrument mounted on the Liverpool Telescope, also provide hints on the nature of the emitting ejecta. The latter event, instead, displays a very peculiar optical to near-infrared light curve, with two achromatic peaks. In this case, while the first peak is probably due to the onset of the afterglow, we interpret the second peak to be produced by newly injected material, signifying a late-time activity of the central engine., We present the discovery of the most distant object detected in the Universe. The GRB 090429B was initially detected by Swift and follow-up observations with the Gemini-N and VLT telescopes revealed a photometric redshift of z~9.4 at high confidence level. We present the discovery from an observer's point of view and discuss the importance of these objects as a probe of the early Universe. Further, we confirm the extreme-redshift origin of GRB 090429B through our spectroscopy and the dust properties of this rare object., , Swift and Fermi have sparked a renaissance in the study of GRBs, discovering an unprecedented number of events and promptly alerting the community with accurate localizations. However, it is in the follow-up, particularly at optical/infrared (OIR) wavebands, where the full scientific potential of these missions is realized. This semester our three teams have merged proposals in order to optimize GRB science using the OIR instrument suites on both Gemini telescopes. Our focus is on extreme and rare GRBs that hold the greatest potential as unique probes of the early universe and stellar death: (1) high-redshift bursts (z &gt; 6), offering spectroscopic probes of the universe during reionization; (2) low-redshift bursts (z&lt;1), the keystone events for understanding the nature of the GRB progenitor; (3) Fermi-LAT bursts, which can constrain theories of quantum gravity and place limits on the Lorentz factor of the outflow; and (4) short GRBs, with the goal of constraining their still-mysterious progenitors. Gemini has emerged as the cornerstone facility of global GRB research and we will continue to use our proprietary access on smaller facilities and our wide network of collaborators to maximize the return of Gemini observations., Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) serve as powerful probes of the early universe, with their luminous afterglows revealing the locations and physical properties of star-forming galaxies at the highest redshifts, and potentially locating first-generation (Population III) stars. Since GRB afterglows have intrinsically very simple spectra, they allow robust redshifts from low signal-to-noise spectroscopy, or photometry. Here we present a photometric redshift of z ~ 9.4 for the Swift detected GRB 090429B based on deep observations with Gemini-North, the Very Large Telescope, and the GRB Optical and Near-infrared Detector. Assuming a Small Magellanic Cloud dust law (which has been found in a majority of GRB sight lines), the 90% likelihood range for the redshift is 9.06 &lt; z &lt; 9.52, although there is a low-probability tail toward somewhat lower redshifts. Adopting Milky Way or Large Magellanic Cloud dust laws leads to very similar conclusions, while a Maiolino law does allow somewhat lower redshift solutions, though in all cases the most likely redshift is found to be z &gt; 7. The non-detection of the host galaxy to deep limits (Y(AB) ~ 28, which would correspond roughly to 0.001L* at z = 1) in our late-time optical and infrared observations with the Hubble Space Telescope strongly supports the extreme-redshift origin of GRB 090429B, since we would expect to have detected any low-z galaxy, even if it were highly dusty. Finally, the energetics of GRB 090429B are comparable to those of other GRBs and suggest that its progenitor is not greatly different from those of lower redshift bursts., , , , , , , , , Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) represent the sole class of catastrophic phenomena seen over almost the entire history of the Universe. Their extreme luminosities in high energy gamma-ray radiation make them readily detectable, even with relatively small satellite-based detectors, out to the earliest cosmic epochs. Moreover, the brilliance of their fading afterglow light, routinely observed in X-ray, optical, near-infrared, and radio wavelengths, allows them to be exploited -- for hours, days, or weeks -- as cosmic lighthouses, probing the conditions of gas and dust along the line of sight, through their host galaxies and the cosmos at large. Since the November 2004 launch of Swift, this GRB-focused NASA mission has discovered more than 500 GRBs, in almost all cases reporting the burst coordinates to ground-based observers within seconds of the event. The availability of prompt burst positions from Swift, combined with promptly-reported flux measurements from instruments on Swift and an array of ground-based robotic telescopes, have enabled targeted spectroscopic campaigns that have gathered detailed observations of the young, bright afterglows of hundreds of these events. This thesis reports the results of my own efforts over the past 5 years, analyzing imaging and spectroscopic observations of Swift-detected GRBs as triggered according to my own requests, or as gathered from public data archives. In Chapter 2, I discuss our follow-up campaign for GRB090429B, one of our best \\\"extreme redshift\\\" (z &gt; 8) candidates. This burst followed closely on the spectroscopicallyconfirmed z = 8.2 GRB090423, and our multiwavelength observations and SED modeling demonstrate the value and limitation of such studies, in cases where a spectroscopic redshift cannot be gathered in a timely fashion. I also address the importance of such extreme-redshift events from a cosmological perspective. In Chapter 3, I use high-resolution GRB afterglow spectra to study the properties of intervening absorbers along GRB lines of sight, in particular, the \\\"very strong\\\" Mg II absorbers, which are often associated with Damped Lyman-alpha systems. By comparing the properties of the absorbers detected along GRB and quasar lines-of-sight, we attempt to shed light on the mysterious excess of such absorbers in GRB (as compared to quasar) spectra. Carrying out a battery of kinematic and qualitative tests, we fail to identify any respect in which the GRB systems systematically differ from the quasar systems, thus disfavoring the hypothesis that some or many of the GRB absorbers are associated with fast-moving gas in the GRB environs or host galaxy. In Chapter 4, I present a summary of five years of GRB afterglow spectroscopic follow-up efforts, the Gemini catalog of mid-resolution afterglow spectra. This dataset consists of more than 50 GRBs observed with the GMOS instruments on the Gemini North and South telescopes; among these objects, we select 22 high signal-to-noise spectra for comprehensive analysis, reporting equivalent widths and upper or lower limits for a large number of atomic species often observed in absorption in GRB afterglow spectra. Applying these results, we explore the metallicity and dust content of the host galaxies of these GRBs, since these properties likely have important implications for the nature of the progenitors and the characterization of the GRB environment. Finally, in my conclusions, I review what we have learned over the past five years, and address some of the open questions in the use of GRB afterglows as cosmic probes that I expect will attract the greatest attention of researchers over the next few years., , , , , , , , I will present a status update and discuss recent results in gamma-ray burst (GRB) follow-up studies using the Gemini telescopes. This work draws upon five years of data obtained using the GMOS and NIRI instruments on Gemini-North and Gemini-South. We observed more than 60 gamma-ray bursts and provided secure redshifts, or constraints on redshifts, for more than 1/3 of them. Working from a high signal-to-noise sample of 15 afterglow spectra obtained with the GMOS spectrograph (R 1200), covering the redshift range 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 4.9, we have measured absorption features equivalent widths and derived column densities for unsaturated lines. I will discuss how our findings relate to previous works on GRB host metallicities, dust content and, also, studies of damped and sub-damped Lyman-alpha systems using observed in quasars spectra. I will present some recent results from Gemini photometric campaigns aimed at identifying the highest-redshift GRBs. GRB 090423 was undetected in an R-band acquisition image leading our group to perform a series of YJH infrared observations with NIRI. A Y-band drop out indicated 7 &lt; z &lt; 9 which was subsequently spectroscopically confirmed at z = 8.2. GRB 090429B had early time deep optical upper limits leading us to trigger izJHK imaging observations. I will present our analysis of these data, which suggest, for the origin of this event, either z 3, with significant intrinsic extinction at the GRB host, or z &gt; 8 with a negligible dust content., , , , , , The startling result of [1] that the number of very strong MgII absorbers (with equivalent width of the blue component bigger than 1 \\u00c5) along gamma-ray burst (GRB) sightlines is nearly four times larger ([dN/dz]GRB = 0.90) than that along quasar sightlines ([dN/dz]QSO = 0.24) has yet to be understood. We reconsider the possibility that the excess of very strong MgII absorbers toward GRBs is due to an origin intrinsic to the GRBs testing for possible differences in some properties (line profile, dust abundance and kinematics) of very strong MgII absorbers found toward GRBs versus those found toward quasars. With a variety of comparisons of equivalent widths of numerous transitions and of the kinematics of the MgII profiles, we find no significant differences between these samples. This implies that if the excess of very strong MgII absorbers toward GRBs is caused by a phenomena in the local GRB environment, that the process involved must have some similarities to that which produces very strong MgII absorbers toward GRB. Although we might be inclined to refute an intrinsic origin of the GRB absorbers, we note that many narrow absorption line systems intrinsic to quasars are quite difficult to distinguish from intervening quasar absorbers despite an obviously different physical origin in accretion disk winds., The startling discovery by Prochter et al. that the frequency of very strong (W<SUB>r</SUB> (2796)&gt;1 \\u00c5) Mg II absorbers along gamma-ray burst (GRB) lines of sight ([dN/dz]<SUB>GRB</SUB> = 0.90) is more than three times the frequency along quasar lines of sight ([dN/dz]<SUB>QSO</SUB> = 0.24), over similar redshift ranges, has yet to be understood. In particular, explanations appealing to dust antibias in quasar samples, partial covering of the quasar sources, and gravitational-lensing amplification of the GRBs have all been carefully examined and found wanting. We therefore reconsider the possibility that the excess of very strong Mg II absorbers toward GRBs is intrinsic either to the GRBs themselves or to their immediate environment, and associated with bulk outflows with velocities as large as v <SUB>max</SUB> ~ 0.3c. In order to examine this hypothesis, we accumulate a sample of 27 W<SUB>r</SUB> (2796)&gt;1 \\u00c5 absorption systems found toward 81 quasars, and compare their properties to those of 8 W<SUB>r</SUB> (2796) &gt; 1 \\u00c5 absorption systems found toward six GRBs; all systems have been observed at high spectral resolution (R = 45, 000) using the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope. We make multiple comparisons of the absorber properties across the two populations, testing for differences in metallicity, ionization state, abundance patterns, dust abundance, kinematics, and phase structure. We find no significant differences between the two absorber populations using any of these metrics, implying that, if the excess of absorbers along GRB lines of sight are indeed intrinsic, they must be produced by a process which has strong similarities to the processes yielding strong Mg II systems associated with intervening galaxies. Although this may seem a priori unlikely, given the high outflow velocities required for any intrinsic model, we note that the same conclusion was reached, recently, with respect to the narrow absorption line systems seen in some quasars., , , The startling result of Prochter &amp; Prochaska (2006) that the incidence of strong MgII absorbers (equivalent width EW(2796\\u00c5) &gt; 1 \\u00c5) along <P />gamma-ray burst (GRB) sightlines is four times larger (dN/dz<SUB>GR</SUB>=0.90) than for quasar sightlines (dN/dz<SUB>QSO</SUB>=0.24) has yet to be understood. <P />In particular, explanations relating to dust bias in quasar samples, partial covering of quasars, and lensing amplification of the GRB beam all fail to satisfy basic observational constraints. We are currently engaged in an effort to explore this mystery using archival VLT/UVES (R=45,000) quasar and afterglow spectra. Identifying strong MgII absorbers in a uniform and statistically complete manner, we have compiled a sample of 28 absorbers toward 81 quasars and 9 absorbers toward 6 GRB afterglows. We explore the kinematics of the absorbers, the abundances of other metal species, and the strength of dust depletion in the GRB and QSO samples. We fail to identify any respects in which 75% of the GRB line-of-sight absorbers can be distinguished from the other members of the GRB and QSO absorber populations. We consider whether this finding rules out the possibility of an intrinsic high-velocity (v 0.2 c) GRB or GRB host-related origin for the excess absorbers, and conclude that it does not., , , , , , , , , Prompted by the result of Prochter et al. (2006) that dN/dz for MgII absorbers with rest frame equivalent widths EW(2796\\u00c5) &gt; 1 \\u00c5 is four times greater along GRB lines of sight than along quasar lines of sight, we examine the kinematic properties of these absorbers in an attempt to discover the origin of this discrepancy. We analyze 28 absorbers along 81 quasar sightlines and 9 absorbers along 6 GRB afterglow sightlines found in the VLT/UVES (R=45,000) archive, finding that trends in kinematic spread vs. EW(2796\\u00c5), kinematic spread vs. redshift, and velocity range vs. redshift are the same for both populations. We also measure the value of the D-index, the ratio of line equivalent width to velocity spread, as discussed in Ellison (2006), and find no distinction between the samples. Although no difference in kinematics is detected between the GRB and the quasar absorbers, we consider the difficulty of differentiating intrinsic quasar absorbers ejected at high velocities from intervening quasar absorbers. Intrinsic quasar absorption line systems are much denser than intervening absorbers and may be ejected at velocities of up to 50,000 km/s, yet they are not always distinguishable from intervening systems via covering factor analysis; the same could be true of intrinsic GRB absorption line systems. We conclude that an intrinsic origin of the absorber excess toward GRBs cannot be ruled out despite the similarities to the intervening quasar absorbers., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , A. Gal-Yam, A. Cucchiara and P. Capak report for the CCCP: We have observed SN 2006at (Dintinjana and Mikuz; IAUC # 8687) with the DBSP spectrograph mounted on the Hale 200\\\" telescope at Palomar Observatory on 2006 March 17 UT, under generally poor conditions. Reduction of the spectrum shows Balmer lines superposed on a blue continuum, indicating this is a type II SN, confirming the suggestion of Brown and Immler (Atel #761) based on early Swift photometry., , , , , , , , , , , , , The flat-spectrum radio quasar 3C 454.3 is well known to be a highly active and variable source with outbursts occurring across the whole electromagnetic spectrum over the last decades. In spring 2005, 3C 454.3 has been reported to exhibit a strong optical outburst which subsequently triggered multi-frequency observations of the source covering the radio up to \\u03b3-ray bands. Here, we present first results of our near-IR/optical (V, R, I, H band) photometry performed between May 11 and August 5, 2005 with the Rapid Eye Mount (REM) at La Silla in Chile and the Automatic Imaging Telescope (AIT) of the Perugia University Observatory. 3C 454.3 was observed during an exceptional and historical high state with a subsequent decrease in brightness over our 86 days observing period. The continuum spectral behaviour during the flaring and declining phase suggests a synchrotron peak below the near-IR band as well as a geometrical origin of the variations e.g. due to changes in the direction of forward beaming., , \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Identifier\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Top 10 Words\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Top 10 Bigrams\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Top 10 Trigrams\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Data Type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Clean\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Subtopics\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

We used the Hubble Space Telescope to monitor stars near the Galactic Center for three years, and we measured the brightness and positions of \\u223c2 million stars at each observing epoch. In addition to this, we monitored the same pointings using the VIMOS imager on the Very Large Telescope. The stars we monitored include several bright microlensing events observed from the ground by the OGLE collaboration. In this paper, we present the analysis of our photometric and astrometric measurements for six of these events, and derive mass constraints for the lens in each of them. Although these constraints are limited by the photometric precision of ground-based data, and our ability to determine the lens distance, we were able to constrain the size of the Einstein ring radius thanks to our precise astrometric measurements\\u2014the first routine measurements of this type from a large-scale observing program. This demonstrates the power of astrometric microlensing as a tool to constrain the masses of stars, stellar remnants, and, in the future, extrasolar planets, using precise ground- and space-based observations. <P />Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained by the Space Telescope Science Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere under ESO programmes 091.D-0489(A) and 093.D-0522(A). STScI is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555., We discuss the potential of the gravitational microlensing method as a unique tool to detect unambiguous signals caused by intermediate-mass black holes in globular clusters. We select clusters near the line of sight to the Galactic bulge and the Small Magellanic Cloud, estimate the density of background stars for each of them, and carry out simulations in order to estimate the probabilities of detecting the astrometric signatures caused by black hole lensing. We find that for several clusters, the probability of detecting such an event is significant with available archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope. Specifically, we find that M 22 is the cluster with the best chances of yielding an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) detection via astrometric microlensing. If M 22 hosts an IMBH of mass 10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>\\u2299</SUB>, then the probability that at least one star will yield a detectable signal over an observational baseline of 20 years is \\u223c86 per cent, while the probability of a null result is around 14 per cent. For an IMBH of mass 10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>\\u2299</SUB>, the detection probability rises to &gt;99 per cent. Future observing facilities will also extend the available time baseline, improving the chance of detections for the clusters we consider., We propose to analyze archival data spanning over 20 years to search for astrometric shifts caused by microlensing of background stars by an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the core of globular cluster M 22. The detection of such a shift would allow us to make the first unambiguous detection of an IMBH, and to constrain its mass, providing us with valuable insight into the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBH) and galaxy evolution. Non-detections of lensing events, coupled with our simulations, would also allow us to place strong constraints on the presence of an IMBH in M 22, which would be particularly interesting in light of the detection of stellar-mass black holes in this cluster (Strader et al. 2012). The main science product of the archival work, long-baseline astrometric measurements of thousands of cluster and Bulge stars, will also be very useful for stellar population studies, allowing for the study of the rotation of the multiple populations in M 22., Despite a lot of indirect observational evidence, no intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) has been detected unambiguously so far. A clear detection would shed light on the possible role of IMBHs in the formation of supermassive black holes, and on the evolution of Galaxies. This could be achieved with gravitational microlensing. We present the results of simulations to estimate the expected astrometric microlensing rates by IMBHs in globular clusters, and show that microlensing has the potential to detect signals that can be unambiguously attributed to an IMBH in several Galactic globular clusters. We also discuss the implication of our simulations for archival studies with available Hubble Space Telescope data, and the impact of JWST and WFIRST on possible future detections., \",\n          \"\\\"On June 1.00 UT (T_0 +2.0h) we began observing the center of the field of GRB 170531B (Evans et al.

We covered 50% of the LAT error region and we obtained a series of 5x120s observations in R band, for a total of 10 minutes on sky.

Their cosmological nature makes them the best tool to explore the final stages in the lives of very massive stars up to the highest redshifts. Furthermore, studying the emission from their low-energy counterparts (optical and infrared) via rapid spectroscopy, we have been able to pin down the exact location of the most distant galaxies as well as placing stringent constraints on their host galaxies and intervening systems at low and high-redshift (e.g. metallicity and neutral hydrogen fraction). In fact, each GRB spectrum contains absorption features imprinted by metals in the host interstellar medium (ISM) as well as the intervening intergalactic medium (IGM) along the line of sight. In this chapter we summarize the progress made using a large dataset of GRB spectra in understanding the nature of both these absorbers and how GRBs can be used to study the early Universe, in particular to measure the neutral hydrogen fraction and the escape fraction of UV photons before and during the epoch of re-ionization., More than 60 GRBs at z &gt;~ 1.5 reside in the vicinity of dense, cold gas as probed by the measured neutral hydrogen via afterglow absorption spectroscopy. We present the largest sample of GRB-DLAs to date in comparison with a sample of DLAs along quasars: the metallicity of the GRB hosts represents a unique tool to understand if this particular subset of galaxies can be the key ingredient for GRB formation (and massive stars) at any redshift as well as the overall cosmic star-formation rate. We show that GRB-DLAs live in a metal enriched environment, especially at z &gt;~ 4, likely the result of recent intense star formation and/or SNe episodes. We also derive that our metallicity measurements are broadly consistent with a mild metallicity bias for the GRB formation., , , , , , , , \",\n          \"This is the second paper in our series about the search for multiple populations in Magellanic Cloud star clusters using the Hubble Space Telescope. Here we report the detection of multiple stellar populations in the colour-magnitude diagrams of the intermediate-age clusters Lindsay 1, NGC 416 and NGC 339. With ages between 6.0 and 7.5 Gyr, these clusters are the youngest ones in which chemical abundance spreads have been detected so far. This confirms that the appearance of multiple populations is not restricted to only ancient globular clusters, but may also be a common feature in clusters as young as 6 Gyr. Our results are in agreement with a recent spectroscopic study of Lindsay 1. We found that the fraction of enriched stars in NGC 416 is \\u223c45 per cent whereas it is \\u223c25 per cent in NGC 339 and \\u223c36 per cent in Lindsay 1. Similar to NGC 121, these fractions are lower than the average value for globular clusters in the Milky Way., We started a photometric survey using the WFC3/UVIS instrument onboard the Hubble Space Telescope to search for multiple populations within Magellanic Cloud star clusters at various ages. In this paper, we introduce this survey. As first results of this programme, we also present multiband photometric observations of NGC 121 in different filters taken with the WFC3/UVIS and ACS/WFC instruments. We analyse the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) of NGC 121, which is the only `classical' globular cluster within the Small Magellanic Cloud. Thereby, we use the pseudo-colour C<SUB>F336W,F438W,F343N</SUB> = (F336W - F438W) - (F438W - F343N) to separate populations with different C and N abundances. We show that the red giant branch splits up in two distinct populations when using this colour combination. NGC 121 thus appears to be similar to Galactic globular clusters in hosting multiple populations. The fraction of enriched stars (N rich, C poor) in NGC 121 is about 32 per cent \\u00b1 3 per cent, which is lower than the median fraction found in Milky Way globular clusters. The enriched population seems to be more centrally concentrated compared to the primordial one. These results are consistent with the recent results by Dalessandro et al. The morphology of the horizontal branch in a CMD using the optical filters F555W and F814W is best produced by a population with a spread in helium of \\u0394Y = 0.025\\u00b10.005., , Using broadband photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope in combination with Very Large Telescope narrowband H\\u03b1 observations of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 300, we explore a method for estimating the escape fractions of hydrogen-ionizing photons from H II regions within this galaxy. Our goal in this concept study is to evaluate the spectral types of the most massive stars using the broadband data and estimating their ionizing photon output with the help of stellar atmosphere models. A comparison with the H\\u03b1 flux that gives the amount of ionized gas in the H II region provides a measure of the escape fraction of ionizing photons from that region. We performed some tests with a number of synthetic young clusters with varying parameters to assess the reliability of the method. However, we found that the derived stellar spectral types and consequently the expected ionizing photon luminosity of a region is highly uncertain. The tests also show that on one hand we tended to overestimate the integrated photon output of a region for young ages and low numbers of stars, and on the other hand we mostly underestimated the combined ionizing luminosity for a large stellar number and older cluster ages. We conclude that the proposed method of using stellar broadband photometry to infer the leakage of ionizing photons from H II regions is highly uncertain and dominated by the errors of the resulting stellar spectral types. Therefore this method is not suitable. Stellar spectra are needed to reliably determine the stellar types and escape fractions. Studies to this end have been carried out for the Magellanic Clouds. <P />Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, and obtained from the Hubble Legacy Archive, which is a collaboration between the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI/NASA), the Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility (ST-ECF/ESA) and the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC/NRC/CSA).Based on observations made with ESO telescopes at the La Silla Paranal Observatory under program ID 077.B-0269(A)., Most star clusters at an intermediate age (1-2 Gyr) in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds show a puzzling feature in their color-magnitude diagrams (CMD) that is not in agreement with a simple stellar population. The main sequence turn-off of these clusters is much broader than expected from photometric uncertainties. One interpretation of this feature is that age spreads of the order of 200-500 Myr exist within individual clusters, although this interpretation is highly debated. Such large age spreads should affect other parts of the CMD, which are sensitive to age, as well. In this study, we analyze the CMDs of a sample of 12 intermediate-age clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud that all show an extended turn-off using archival optical data taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. We fit the star formation history of the turn-off region and the red clump region independently. We find that in most cases, the age spreads inferred from the red clumps are smaller than those that result from the turn-off region. However, the age ranges that result from the red clump region are broader than expected for a single age. Only two out of 12 clusters in our sample show a red clump which seems to be consistent with a single age. As our results are ambiguous, by fitting the star formation histories to the red clump regions, we cannot ultimately tell if the extended main sequence turn-off feature is the result of an age spread or not. However, we do find that the width of the extended main sequence turn-off feature is correlated with the age of the clusters in a way which would be unexplained in the so-called age spread interpretation, but which may be expected if stellar rotation is the cause of the spread at the turn-off. <P />Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, and obtained from the Hubble Legacy Archive, which is a collaboration between the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI/NASA), the Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility (ST-ECF/ESA), and the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC/NRC/CSA).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Identifier\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Top 10 Words\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Top 10 Bigrams\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Top 10 Trigrams\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Data Type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Clean\",\n          \"Dirty\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

While prompt and contemporaneous panchromatic observations have the potential to test predictions of the internal-external shock model, extensive multiband imaging has been conducted for only a few GRBs. We present rich, early-time, multiband data sets for two Swift events, GRB 110205A and GRB 110213A. The former shows optical emission since the early stages of the prompt phase, followed by the steep rising in flux up to ~1000 s after the burst (t <SUP>-\\u03b1</SUP> with \\u03b1 = -6.13 \\u00b1 0.75). We discuss this feature in the context of the reverse-shock scenario and interpret the following single power-law decay as being forward-shock dominated. Polarization measurements, obtained with the RINGO2 instrument mounted on the Liverpool Telescope, also provide hints on the nature of the emitting ejecta. The latter event, instead, displays a very peculiar optical to near-infrared light curve, with two achromatic peaks. In this case, while the first peak is probably due to the onset of the afterglow, we interpret the second peak to be produced by newly injected material, signifying a late-time activity of the central engine., Swift and Fermi have sparked a renaissance in the study of GRBs, discovering an unprecedented number of events and promptly alerting the community with accurate localizations. However, it is in the follow-up, particularly at optical/infrared (OIR) wavebands, where the full scientific potential of these missions is realized. This semester our three teams have merged proposals in order to optimize GRB science using the OIR instrument suites on both Gemini telescopes. Our focus is on extreme and rare GRBs that hold the greatest potential as unique probes of the early universe and stellar death: (1) high-redshift bursts (z &gt; 6), offering spectroscopic probes of the universe during reionization; (2) low-redshift bursts (z&lt;1), the keystone events for understanding the nature of the GRB progenitor; (3) Fermi-LAT bursts, which can constrain theories of quantum gravity and place limits on the Lorentz factor of the outflow; and (4) short GRBs, with the goal of constraining their still-mysterious progenitors. Gemini has emerged as the cornerstone facility of global GRB research and we will continue to use our proprietary access on smaller facilities and our wide network of collaborators to maximize the return of Gemini observations., Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) serve as powerful probes of the early universe, with their luminous afterglows revealing the locations and physical properties of star-forming galaxies at the highest redshifts, and potentially locating first-generation (Population III) stars. Since GRB afterglows have intrinsically very simple spectra, they allow robust redshifts from low signal-to-noise spectroscopy, or photometry. Here we present a photometric redshift of z ~ 9.4 for the Swift detected GRB 090429B based on deep observations with Gemini-North, the Very Large Telescope, and the GRB Optical and Near-infrared Detector. Assuming a Small Magellanic Cloud dust law (which has been found in a majority of GRB sight lines), the 90% likelihood range for the redshift is 9.06 &lt; z &lt; 9.52, although there is a low-probability tail toward somewhat lower redshifts. Adopting Milky Way or Large Magellanic Cloud dust laws leads to very similar conclusions, while a Maiolino law does allow somewhat lower redshift solutions, though in all cases the most likely redshift is found to be z &gt; 7. The non-detection of the host galaxy to deep limits (Y(AB) ~ 28, which would correspond roughly to 0.001L* at z = 1) in our late-time optical and infrared observations with the Hubble Space Telescope strongly supports the extreme-redshift origin of GRB 090429B, since we would expect to have detected any low-z galaxy, even if it were highly dusty. Finally, the energetics of GRB 090429B are comparable to those of other GRBs and suggest that its progenitor is not greatly different from those of lower redshift bursts.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Identifier\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Top 10 Words\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Top 10 Bigrams\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Top 10 Trigrams\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Data Type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Clean\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Subtopics\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The telescope was deployed at Winer Observatory in October 2004. A testing phase was conducted by observing the Hyades cluster for four weeks. Here we report on the observations of the Hyades and present initial analysis of the data., Transits of bright stars offer a unique opportunity to study detailed properties of extrasolar planets that cannot be determined through radial-velocity observations. We propose a technique to find such systems using all-sky small-aperture transit surveys. The optimal telescope design for finding transits of bright stars is a 5 cm ``telescope'' with a 4k x 4k camera. We are currently building such a system and expect to detect ~10 bright star transits after one year of operation., Transits of bright stars offer a unique opportunity to study detailed properties of extrasolar planets that cannot be determined through radial-velocity observations. We propose a new technique to find such systems using all-sky small-aperture transit surveys. We derive a general formula for the number of stars that can be probed for such systems as a function of the characteristics of the star, the planet, and the survey. We use this formula to derive the optimal telescope design for finding transits of bright stars: a 2 inch ``telescope'' with a 4k x 4k, Transits of bright stars offer a unique opportunity to study detailed properties of extrasolar planets that cannot be determined through radial-velocity observations. We propose a new technique to find such systems using all-sky small-aperture transit surveys. We derive a general formula for the number of stars that can be probed for such systems as a function of the characteristics of the star, the planet, and the survey. We use this formula to derive the optimal telescope design for finding transits of bright stars: a 1'' to 2'' ''telescope'' with a 4k by 4k camera. This work was supported in part by grant AST 02-01266 from the NSF., Planetary transits of bright stars, V &lt; 10, offer the best opportunity for detailed studies of extra-solar planets, such as are already being carried out for HD209458b. Since these stars are rare, they should be searched over the entire sky. In the limits of zero read-out time, zero sky noise, and perfect optics, the sensitivity of an all-sky survey is independent of telescope aperture: for fixed detector size and focal ratio, the greater light-gathering power of larger telescopes is exactly cancelled by their reduced field of view. Finite read-out times strongly favor smaller telescopes because exposures are longer so a smaller fraction of time is wasted on readout. However, if the aperture is too small, the sky noise in one pixel exceeds the stellar flux and the field of view becomes so large that optical distortions become unmanageable. We find that the optimal aperture is about 1\\\". A one-year survey using such a 1\\\" telescope could detect essentially all hot-jupiter transits of V &lt; 10 stars observable from a given site.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Identifier\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Top 10 Words\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Top 10 Bigrams\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Top 10 Trigrams\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Data Type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Dirty, Dirty, Dirty, Dirty, Dirty\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Environmental characteristics of Mars were emulated, including pressure, atmospheric composition, and temperature. Existing and newly acquired hardware were integrated with a centralized controller to bring about successful near-autonomous operation and temperature control. The MEC is principally comprised of systems that control atmospheric pressure, atmospheric content, and chamber temperature. The temperature control system is used to replicate temperatures within actual minimum and maximum values as would be experienced on Mars. Cryogenic liquid/gaseous nitrogen supplies as well as various heating techniques were used to obtain this temperature range. Fundamental to the stabilization of temperature within the chamber was the instrumentation of multiple temperature measurements and optimal control of extremely cold nitrogen. Through testing and characterization, cooling design modifications, and controller instrumentation revisions, the cryogenic supply was successfully throttled by a programmable controller system with appropriate programming. Stable temperature control was ultimately achieved and automated diurnal cycling provided.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Identifier\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Top 10 Words\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Top 10 Bigrams\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Top 10 Trigrams\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Data Type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Dirty\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Subtopics\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Such activities train students to take careful measurements, keep detailed records, and comprehend three-dimensional coordinates.\",\n          \"The planned expansion of the human presence on our moon demands that we reconsider our relationships with our planet's partner. Threats to the moon such as those engendered by mining encourage the preservation of various precious areas of our moon's surface through the emplacement of international multiuse land reserves. These reserves, arising from tested environmental science strategies as well as values drawn from the ethnographic field, allow concurrent pursuits of industry, science, environmental preservation, respect for human cultural landscapes, as well as future recreation. By protecting the near side patterns in the moon, the Hertzsprung and Von K\\u00e1rm\\u00e1n Craters on the far side, and polar regions at Malapert, Peary, and Florey, we leave room for industry while also avoiding pointless losses of the moon's own majesty or damage to ourselves in our interactions with the moon. In creating these reserves in line with the Outer Space Treaty, we move closer to the desirable environmental justice outcome in which each human theoretically has a say in the fate of our moon, which is the cultural heritage of every one of us., Current calls to protect the Martian environment with \\\"Planetary Parks\\\" maintain environmental merit. However, they lack a sufficiently urgent timeframe for initiating protection and a robust scientific method for the establishment of noteworthy Martian natural landmarks as natural reserves. In response, if we return to the seminal environmental preservation teachings of Aldo Leopold and John Muir, we encounter the importance of grounding Martian preservation efforts on the fundamental environmental science method of a base-datum of normality, or baseline ecology. This method establishes natural reserves that feature both minimal human interference and known origination dates, thereby providing longitudinal environmental control samples for scientific use. Applied before humans appear on Mars, preserved baseline ecologies thereby aid our scientific understanding of human environmental impacts, both now and well into the future, while they enhance a variety of other outcomes in terms of Martian protection. However, the baseline ecology method requires that, through international agreements, we establish these reserves as quickly as possible and certainly before humans arrive on the planet.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Identifier\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Top 10 Words\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Top 10 Bigrams\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Top 10 Trigrams\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Data Type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Clean\",\n          \"Dirty\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Subtopics\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

We summarize fundamental constraints of numerical modelling and the techniques to alleviate these restrictions. Brief summary of the relevant observations that the simulations seek to capture is given. We survey the current progress of simulations of solar convection and the resulting large-scale dynamo. We continue to studies that model the Sun at different ages and to studies of stars of different masses and evolutionary stages. Both simulations and observations indicate that rotation, measured by the Rossby number which is the ratio of rotation period and convective turnover time, is a key ingredient in setting the overall level and characteristics of magnetic activity. Finally, efforts to understand global 3D simulations in terms of mean-field dynamo theory are discussed.\",\n          \"None\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Identifier\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Top 10 Words\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Top 10 Bigrams\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Top 10 Trigrams\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Data Type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Clean\",\n          \"Dirty\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
